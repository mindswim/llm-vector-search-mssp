Gnosticism and all this weird [ __ ]

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.580
what's that Gnosticism is like the it's

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.990
like a sect of Christianity that

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.180
believes that God doesn't love you

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.820
basically it's like God's gods a

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.460
Demiurge kind of I'm into that it's like

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.770
the world's created by a Demiurge which

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.930
is basically just it's a god but it's

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.210
like more or less like the devil it's

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.919
like it's like a god that's like yeah

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:46.080
linked to the physical realm and just

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.760
created the world and was just like

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.930
there's a bunch of different versions of

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.820
like people were like something like

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.650
some people think that God just like has

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.690
him dementia and just like we were

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.250
created by like a demented being that

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.750
completely just forgot what it did and

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.120
like we're just lost and stranded and

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.250
then there's like just an evil [ __ ]

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.470
Demiurge that created us just to torture

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.659
us in the physical realm it's pretty

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:08.729
[ __ ] up and like that's been like an

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:11.820
ordered agnostic or agnosticism is like

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.409
the we have to get smarter and smarter

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:15.210
and wait it's not enough what's it

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.820
called Gnosticism and agnostic and

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.440
agnostic is atheism except agnosticism

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.840
is you don't you don't know you don't

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.050
know that's always thought that's

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.349
Gnosticism is being created by all

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:36.089
loving all-knowing god it's a very

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:38.099
limited God here like creates you and

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:41.550
it's like [ __ ] I'm done with this and

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.229
this walks away so then we've been

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:45.180
abandoned by a creator and we have to

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.130
become as smart as humanly possible the

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.660
only way we can free ourselves is to the

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.940
truth which

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.430
the guy I'm reading just laughed at

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.570
being like this is just another

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.460
basically saying that like scientific

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.710
progress and like how we're gonna

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.240
eventually become immortal he's like

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.650
it's just another religion then we're

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.460
just trapped in it

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.290
how like basically like in Christianity

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.630
in the 1400s like that was a letter of

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.040
like you would if you question that

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.080
people like you're [ __ ] [ __ ] of

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.180
course this Christianity yes that's our

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.740
Christianity we're in Mersin and we

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.320
can't like see our way out of I wish I

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.850
believed in religion enough to [ __ ]

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.770
kill people well that's and that's gotta

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.090
be [ __ ] awesome like if I cared

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.410
enough about it to be like yo you better

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.660
[ __ ] listen to me dude just the

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.670
crusade yeah well that I mean that he's

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.380
saying that uh that our version of that

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.260
now is like scientific progress where

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.360
it's like we can shape the world and

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.190
make it a perfect place just like Noah

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.440
can suits up Wow he's like this is

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.910
you're just deluded like people are

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:39.810
deluded forever

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:40.890
yeah but then what's the alternative

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:46.200
[ __ ] sweet oblivion of death he's

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.430
making money off this no he doesn't he's

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.350
not he's not pessimistic he's just kind

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.670
of like you know once you realize that

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.650
you're just an animal and like we're

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.150
just an animal that thrives on illusion

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.410
he's like it's kind of peaceful just

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.910
again like live out your days just you

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.080
can still be nice you don't to be like a

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.940
total [ __ ] but he's like you can

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.560
stop toiling and [ __ ] kidding

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.210
yourself yeah it's just one man's

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.440
opinion this isn't the letter of the law

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.180
but I was reading a lot of [ __ ] lately I

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.280
was laying in bed I have the most [ __ ]

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.000

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.340
had a dream at that show in Syracuse I

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.820
shared a room with Beezer and Kaila and

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.530
apparently I was dreaming about [ __ ]

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.480
yeah in my dreams to be like yeah that's

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.730
it oh my said I was saying that's it

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.020
like sexually be like mm what dude I

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.220
think I've been recording this in the

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.430
wrong thing oh good hold on we back

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.510
false alarm oh my my bed my bad I don't

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.580
know I don't understand how [ __ ]

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.490
technology works a parent we have done

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:56.490
this show four times 105 now 150 times

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.690
and literally every single time we start

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.050
the show probably sometimes it's up to

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.209
fifteen minutes yeah it's usually around

00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:09.449
five to 15 minutes of us just turning

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:12.420
turning knobs no let's have no idea how

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.879
the soundboard works we turn knobs over

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:16.889
and over again until it's like I try now

00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:21.449
try now yeah to think that we might not

00:11:21.449 --> 00:11:23.309
even be talking into these microphones

00:11:23.309 --> 00:11:25.139
right now I don't know if we're just

00:11:25.139 --> 00:11:26.939
talking into my laptop or well now cuz I

00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:29.730
sounded loud okay gotcha sound yes you

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.709

it kind of try to make it work you know

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.049
what that's pretty indicative of the

00:11:40.049 --> 00:11:42.480
show true - if I can sit down turn some

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.730

the land was just utterly indifferent to

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.290
it was just like whatever other cousins

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.059

00:22:32.179 --> 00:22:33.410
cracking me up it was just funny to

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.910

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.030
a little young if he was piece of a leaf

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.710
I mean he was like one of those guys who

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:58.040
could have been like 40 or 60 so he was

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.770
a geezer sniffing twisted yeah or he

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.020

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.790
smoking meth he could have been 40 going

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:05.990
on like say he was one of those dudes

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.270

00:29:34.889 --> 00:29:36.899
the saddest [ __ ] thing they're so

00:29:36.899 --> 00:29:38.429
miserable

00:29:38.429 --> 00:29:40.440
I've done a couple casinos lately and

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.940
it's just every time there's another

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.610
horrible dude whole casinos the noises

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.379
coming from the slot machines are all in

00:29:46.379 --> 00:29:49.080
the seat key or the key of C because

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:54.230
it's the least tiring key of music wow

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.549
they're all in the same key and it's to

00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:59.039
keep you like kind of awake and alert

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.929
they obviously take the clocks out and

00:30:00.929 --> 00:30:03.149
they have a window she knows about right

00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:05.399
angles they don't ever want right angles

00:30:05.399 --> 00:30:07.980
cuz right angles are like a I forget how

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.120
to explain it but it's like a like a

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.309
definitive end where you see it like it

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:13.110
stops it's like kind of saying like stop

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.210
so they'll have like it's over your

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.340
ankles exactly so they want you're gonna

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.870
be like almost give people the sense

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:20.460
that there's no limit to anything and

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.080
you're just in there there's no time no

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.330
limit and like real gamblers get in a

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.190
flow state whereas it's not about

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:27.750
winning or losing it's about just going

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.000
like next next next next next and you're

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.889
just like literally lose all sense of

00:30:31.889 --> 00:30:33.059
everything and they're saying like real

00:30:33.059 --> 00:30:34.590
gamblers when they win some of them are

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.299
like [ __ ] because it takes you out of

00:30:36.299 --> 00:30:38.519
the flow damn dude I was I've been

00:30:38.519 --> 00:30:40.200
listening the thing about casinos it

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.970
it's wild that's [ __ ] insane

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:43.320
yeah casinos are far

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.820
dad gets in a free state of the elks

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.700
yeah these guys putting money down the

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.530
Cowboys he starts to put money down he

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:52.500
gets in a free state gambling is revenue

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.740
from casinos is more than I think music

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:59.340
and movies combined like it doubles them

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.400
and then sports betting is say it's like

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.140
pretty it's a pretty big chunk it's like

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.990
yeah thirty five billion dollars a year

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.580
casinos I think you're like 50 all right

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.720
so what do we need to do to save

[ __ ] up I know I'm in there I'm like

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:53.160
[ __ ] place is disgust

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.200
yeah rabies I mean I should have he was

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.450
exactly a profile thing makes perfect

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.460
sense yeah man that's why analyzing when

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.290
to give you money yeah give you a little

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.320
back when the thing is like but yeah

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.090
yeah think of the [ __ ] up dude who

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.890
formulated that computer program well

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.900
dude it was I think from like it might

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.010
have been Skinner or one of those guys

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.300
and they're studying rats when they were

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.830
doing all that like you know the pavlo

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.700
nyan training if you randomized so if

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.110
you give a rat a switch and if it hits a

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.370
switch it gets food it'll hit a switch

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:23.660
you get food in my garden go about it

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.490
stay if you randomized when the food

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:26.660
comes out and the rattle to sit there

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.520
all day and like just keep hitting the

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.230
lever because it like the shit's fun cuz

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.060
it's like something comes out something

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.060
comes out yeah but the my whole thing is

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:39.500
that I think people need to cuz it'll

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.760
never work politically you're not gonna

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.040
do communism you know capitalism it's

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.570
just there's limited resources I don't

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:46.100
think it's bad honestly but I think

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.590
there's limited resources but it'll have

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:49.700
to get to the point where there's like a

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.710
something like capitalism that takes

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.530
into account people's

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:56.210
competitive nature or like you can't it

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.320
doesn't work if you give everyone the

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.220
same thing everyone's gonna freak the

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.050
[ __ ] out but if you have the competitive

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:03.380
nature but you somehow culturally make

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.640
being super rich be grotesque to where

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.900

trying to in some level hit something

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.960

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.470
like like you despicable kind of we're

00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:29.120

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.010
became Amazon

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.960
I wouldn't for a second believe that I

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.360
would be like I might actually [ __ ]

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.000

didn't go all the way but you know my

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.300
thing is they have to because it's like

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.000

everyone talks about poverty how it's

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:53.260
like you know it creates all these

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.060
problems no one talks about the problems

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.560
created by the kids who grow up with

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.900
like unlimited funds I've seen it yeah

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.849
that's a whole other like that's a whole

00:36:00.849 --> 00:36:03.670
other a weird kind of person you can

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.050
produce that has like socially

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:07.599
undesirable effects yeah and it's like

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:08.980
no one talks about it you know it's like

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.599
it we got a wrangle you know that has to

00:36:10.599 --> 00:36:12.160
be wrangled just like people being poor

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.260
but not in a way that's like you can't

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.940
just like burn them or like take all

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.230
their [ __ ] or like stab them with

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:19.630
pitchforks it have to be you have to

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:22.720
make it to where people who want that

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.640
you're just as reviewed as Psychopaths

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.920
and people are like hey man like what is

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.570
everything okay why do you need seven

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:31.660
billion slowly I think we might be but I

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.400
don't know dude I don't know that gets

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.740
cream helps you think I feel like you

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.200
like Dan Bilzerian people are like [ __ ]

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.990
that guy yeah obviously there's which

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.910
are million guys they're like hell yeah

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:45.339
this guy rocks exactly so it's like

00:36:45.339 --> 00:36:46.869
that's a thing it's gonna take the point

00:36:46.869 --> 00:36:48.760
where you see a Bezos here's the rich

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.550
kids of Instagram know there's that

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.200
pretty face a lot of kids that are like

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.690
that person that grew up like their

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:57.790
parents are like the owners of an Indian

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:01.450
bank it's like Indian dork that just

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:04.060
earns money on Instagram like puts

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.830
stacks of hundreds in the toilet and is

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:07.630
like [ __ ] all you poor pieces of [ __ ]

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.550
every comments like you don't have any

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:12.930
[ __ ] friends and he's like [ __ ] you

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.110
it's well that's the whole thing in the

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.550
whole that that's my point the whole

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:19.370
point of more or less the point of the

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.470
enterprise of not everyone but the point

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:23.810
is to save up enough capital to free

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.760
yourself from work because once you have

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.470
enough capital you get to exit the rat

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:29.000
race and just live off your little sum

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.650
of money which usually tends to last

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:32.300
maybe three generations before people

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.220
just totally [ __ ] it up with your son

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.910
burning money and throwing it so I think

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:40.790
Jackie Chan um didn't give his son any

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.170
money one of the I think one of those

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:43.580
actors was just like if you if you

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.290
deserve it you'll get it I'm donating oh

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.960
man [ __ ] beast yeah I watched

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.700
somebody I think everyone should do that

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.740
just there should I think in a way that

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.810
should be you can set your kids up I

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.010
think there's my boy Wes was saying this

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:56.600
you should set your kids up schooling

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.100
you can give your kids money for school

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.320
then it's it you have to do other stuff

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.600
with all you die I think that's pretty

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.550
fair because you're really by giving

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.950
kids a hundred million dollars to start

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.480
their life with your creating a [ __ ]

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:08.870
monster

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.960
I'd be dead a small loan of I'd be dead

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.450
dude getting some D Trump going yeah

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.610
dude D Trump story what he was doing

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:17.870
with those casinos I was listening to

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:19.850
that he that was crazy what was he doing

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:21.260
he just built like the coolest looking

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.180
casino in the world it's not yeah it was

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.980
a Ponzi scheme home yeah he didn't have

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.450
any he just took out all these crazy

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.840
loans and then it's kept commit uh

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.340
declaring bankruptcy he were just

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.320
businesses would go out would go under

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.760
he'd beg for political I don't know what

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.410
he did with politics but he begged for

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:38.330
like politicians a grant him leniency

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:39.860
they did I find let him keep doing it

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.630
and finally he just that was a total

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.630
Ponzi scheme according to this book but

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:46.280
yeah I think everything I've seen about

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.260
Trump and the Taj Mahal and all that was

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.680
like pure criminality yeah well he yeah

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.440
he's like main man oh yeah so he like he

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.060
got in there gotten the thing built and

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:58.070
it was totally like the guy who was like

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:01.070
an advisor or like a an advisor in the

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:03.020
Gaming Commission was like this is gonna

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.700
have to profit like it was something

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.950
like 150 million dollars a day in order

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:08.330
for this to actually make sense he's

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:10.820
yeah no casinos ever done anything they

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:11.900
were saying that from beginning what was

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.330
it it was that in the book you in yeah

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.850
in a America the farewell tour Chris

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:19.420
Hedges dude it's [ __ ] fantastic so he

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.440
Trump would just got in there and was

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.270
had this big money wheel going and then

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:24.020
with his right he

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.910
the CEO or owner whatever was so he

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:27.530
would pay himself like millions of

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:29.210
dollars out of this money will and then

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.560
the [ __ ] would hit the fan because it

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.940
couldn't work out then he'd be like all

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.680
right I'm bankrupt and then they I think

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.850
you just did that with a couple other

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:36.950
things that was and he admitted that

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:38.240
that was his [ __ ] he was like yeah I

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.680
took advantage of the [ __ ] of the

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.300
holes like the system sucks so I did it

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.060
yeah man he did he [ __ ] did so but

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.000
it's like his uh his like right-hand man

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.790
so like in the Taj Mahal it would just

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:51.590
be like if you were like an elite you

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.780
could land on you would be helicoptered

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.790
in and you'd stain like one of the

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:57.800
penthouses and the dude who like was on

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.720
top of the he'll like the helipad he was

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.800
like waving people down was like a

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.110
three-time felon who got in trouble for

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:04.700
like drugs and you know he was like

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.160
selling coke and weed and that was like

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.570
Trump's right-hand man I guess he was

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:10.130
like selling all the drugs in that area

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:12.200
keeping everything going so he I think

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.880
he was like Trump's like right-hand thug

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.310
but when that guy went to jail he got a

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:18.860
pardon he end up getting a big coke but

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.020
pension he did like seven months he got

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.480
pardoned hell yeah and eventually the

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.920
Atacama Hall eventually all fell apart

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.750
and like yeah Trump just [ __ ] walked

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:28.070
away of a bunch of everyone so he said

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:29.480
it was like he's broke it's like yeah

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.100
the Taj Mahal I'm broke he was taking

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.680
millions out of the year so yeah I don't

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.880
mean I don't know much about his money

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.070
but like he was getting paid out of that

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:41.090
she's pretty crazy hell yeah yeah so

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:42.640
that was my little diatribe I wanna

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.500
[ __ ] all that stuff that's sick dude

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.330
I'm trying to get that out there that's

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:48.500
been that stuff's been kicking around my

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.910
head for a while but yeah that's what I

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:51.230
think it'll be if people eventually get

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.420
to the point where becoming like rich

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.890
for the sake of just having a bunch of

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:56.570
money if they can get that if they can

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:59.060
be like that's kind of weird and I'm

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:00.410
just like going to try to do something

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:02.990
worthwhile that's cool I think people

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.990
have a little more chance but it sounds

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:11.750
like Christianity II possibly now I

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:13.120
don't think so

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:18.260
could be some [ __ ] about rich guys yeah

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.700
but he also said the poor always be

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.620
there don't worry about them dying with

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.380
me tonight on this last night but yeah

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.760
he definitely he didn't yeah I mean he

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.040
definitely got crushed Jesus did

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.470
actually he he walked up to the did I

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:31.730
told you about the [ __ ] Church back

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:33.590
then yeah that was a big that was truck

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.570
I was a Taj Mahal dude of them just

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:36.950
being like hey give us 20 shekels and

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:37.619
we'll burn a goat

00:41:37.619 --> 00:41:39.029
you and then Jesus was like yo bro you

00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:40.200
don't need to pay these guys you can

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.460
just do this [ __ ] yourself and you're

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.319
like don't talk to him don't don't

00:41:43.319 --> 00:41:45.869
crucify his that's kind of like you

00:41:45.869 --> 00:41:48.869
right now when they call myself a

00:41:48.869 --> 00:41:52.289
messiah figure but no the that's that's

00:41:52.289 --> 00:41:53.579
the weird thing about Christianity the

00:41:53.579 --> 00:41:55.619
whole symbol of Christianity is [ __ ]

00:41:55.619 --> 00:41:57.180
this guy who came is like you don't need

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.910
a hierarchical religion and then they

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.740
killed him for that and then started a

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.170
hierarchical religion in his name with

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:09.779
him murdered as its symbol weird Saint

00:42:09.779 --> 00:42:11.220
Paul started [ __ ] Christianity not

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:14.249
Jesus bro hell yeah so is what it is I

00:42:14.249 --> 00:42:15.990
thought was assignment those Peter I

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:17.999
think it was Paul thought could be wrong

00:42:17.999 --> 00:42:20.069
I thought Peter was the rock though he's

00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:21.960
the first pope Peter Cook he might have

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.309
been the first pope I think Paul was the

00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:27.950
[ __ ] always [ __ ] Jew ringleader

hooked up to a wire and it's like

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.440

high yeah yeah I don't know yeah that

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:31.940
sounds like the worst way one of the

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.530
worst you think so now the worst way is

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.690
walking into a those dudes that commit

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:37.520
suicide by going into like a lion's den

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.520
it's like the cereal that's the one like

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.290
the in the bridge in the documentary the

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:44.570

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:46.700

my god of course he did

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.450
seriously walk into a [ __ ] zoo

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:51.770
enclosure and you're like this bears

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:57.350
the speed at which you'd hit the ground

00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:00.830
jumping off the Grand Canyon I mean you

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:02.900
must pass out in the air no I think

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:09.170
that's a Mythbusters did that what I

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:12.020
think Mythbusters busted the 9/11

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.600
conspiracy today the jumpers like had

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.730
heart attacks on the way down how the

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:19.760
[ __ ] did 9/11 that's funny they both

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.950
know what's watching the show anymore we

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:24.290
gotta test this man they jumped out of

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:27.230
the new building um yeah people say that

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:28.700
I remember that hearing that at like

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:31.070
9/11 9/11 happened like if you jump from

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:32.660
that high you'll you'll go into shock

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:33.620
and have like a heart attack

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.420
it's like Manuel you have a heart attack

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:37.510
I thought you just pass you probably

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:41.030

you've hurt ground and it's gotta be

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:48.850
like a bug hitting the windshield

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:51.290
sometimes you must turn the turtle soup

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:54.800
dude instantly sometimes goddamn that's

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.200

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.200
a shotgun in his mouth and he moved it

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.640
the last second just blew the side of

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.910
his face out now he's just a [ __ ]

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:18.920
motivational speaker like don't [ __ ]

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.220

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.770
yeah there you go yeah if things go bad

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.240
enough I'm just gonna shoot the side of

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.100
my face out that's good

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:29.630
just be like be motivational with some

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:32.000
[ __ ] speeches are used to be really

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.130
sad I'll run some bits by those kids

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:38.970
your friend / czi nor dude anyway back

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:42.660
to the speed don't [ __ ] do it yeah man

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.029
why I really do think that's the only

00:52:45.029 --> 00:52:46.349
thing that can replace religion now is

00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:48.599
people and again could be wrong but I

00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:49.799
think it's people starting to just do

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:52.170
like acid mushrooms and stuff it's

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:53.430
interesting you think this is the time

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:55.559
in history in human history where we

00:52:55.559 --> 00:52:59.729
replace religion it's a little uh I'd

00:52:59.729 --> 00:53:01.829
say borderline arrogant of you what do

00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:04.499
you mean you think yeah I don't know I

00:53:04.499 --> 00:53:06.239
mean it started in like the 1800s

00:53:06.239 --> 00:53:09.390
I'm religion yeah I mean it started to

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:12.479
kind of falter on a massive scale at

00:53:12.479 --> 00:53:16.349
least in the West okay yeah with the

00:53:16.349 --> 00:53:17.880
Enlightenment it started to kind of like

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.369
fall apart okay so it's like but I think

00:53:20.369 --> 00:53:24.720
we're stuck in a weird like what you

therapy like they all do yeah and

00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:18.660
they're all very strong proponents of it

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:19.620
they're like you gotta [ __ ] do it

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:22.830
it's pretty tight well it's like it's

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:26.760
cool to do just you you basically it's

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.290
just you figure this [ __ ] out for

00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:28.830
yourself

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:30.240
they kind of like point stuff out here

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.070
and there but you just talk and it it's

00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:33.150
kind of like oh that's weird what about

00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:35.490

your blind spots for just like I never

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.780
thought of that but it's pretty cool

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.640
I like it say something I look forward

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:42.720
to you gotta find a good therapist the

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.670

also like everybody that does comedy is

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:16.410
[ __ ] up and then it's like oh yeah or

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:18.180

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.640
open yeah exactly pretty much everyone's

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.590

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.410
and they have their own environment we

00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:32.430
have to completely repress everything

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:35.820
going on it's like while like scrambling

00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:38.220

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.100
twisted environment I mean comedy is a

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:43.710
[ __ ] up weird environment - yeah yeah

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:44.100
dude

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.240

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:52.140
lemare boy that was [ __ ] that was one

00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:54.420
shot too far dude that was the be

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:57.330
literal edge you think I don't think so

00:56:57.330 --> 00:57:01.470
this'll blow over nothing matters

00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:04.200
matters it matters dude it's just uh you

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.720
know gotta be you gotta be at peace with

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:08.430
the fact that one day you get the fizzle

00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:13.650
out dude enjoy everything and let's go

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:20.640
down somebody deal I've been reading a

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.710
lot of real dark stuff at nighttime

00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:24.060
before I go to bed you're reading the

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.550
dark arts before bed yeah a lot of John

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:29.640
Gray he's a [ __ ] it's a dark bull

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.580
yeah but is he talking about everything

00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:33.660
I've been talking about the whole thing

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.400
on people Ardell progress is a myth and

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.990
how it's just like good progress is like

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:38.609
the decaying Christian myth now we think

00:57:38.609 --> 00:57:40.230
we're going to like separate our so

00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:42.480
we're separate from nature it's really

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.310
not a depressing thing he's his whole

00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:47.160
thing is like you don't like people

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.630
think like we're we always say like why

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:50.099
did we come into this world he's like we

00:57:50.099 --> 00:57:51.240
don't come into what we come out of it

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.710
we're just like waves popping you know

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:54.840
popping up an ocean we're just like man

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.520
I'm down you know what I mean so it's

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.380
like it's a nice way to think I thought

00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:00.480
when I was a kid that because we were

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.310
talking about predestination like

00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:04.290
predetermined and like free choice and

00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:06.210
all that and I was when I was young I

00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:08.040
was like well we're all animals and if

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.810
cuz I remember they were like dogs don't

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:10.680
have souls

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.000
I remember in Catholic school they're

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.349
like dogs don't have souls they can't

00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:14.940
think yeah it was some [ __ ] they

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.619
only make decision off instincts and I

00:58:16.619 --> 00:58:18.720
was like well so do we

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:20.160
they didn't have they don't like that

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.290
like we're all instinct therefore

00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:23.490
everything is predetermined

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:26.520
maybe instinct is God what they say

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.270
they're like you're [ __ ] weird kids

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:33.300
here's an extra [ __ ] lunch double

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:39.480
lunch dude you're gonna play yo line now

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.849
I think philosophy is gay so they won

00:58:41.849 --> 00:58:44.369
they won dude perfect yeah my philosophy

00:58:44.369 --> 00:58:45.839
is [ __ ] lame dude I've not hated

00:58:45.839 --> 00:58:48.060
philosophy food is never an answer so I

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:49.290
[ __ ] hate it it sucks

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:51.089
yeah it really there's a thing called

00:58:51.089 --> 00:58:52.950
the school life on YouTube and they go

00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:54.660
through all the Western thinkers from

00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:55.859
like the very beginning and they give

00:58:55.859 --> 00:58:57.359
you like a nine minute rundown I'm like

00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:59.010
what a lot of this stuff is kind of cool

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:02.070
but yeah a lot of it's just like just

00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:04.290
jerk-off stuff I remember one guys like

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:06.570
morality he was talking about how we're

00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:09.540
all just bags of meat basically yeah

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:10.980
like we're all just running on it like

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.690
nothing that and then the guy he was

00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:14.730
telling that to just kicked a dog

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:15.630
like in front of them while they're

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:17.700
walking he's like what the [ __ ] man he's

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:19.020
like where's it you're not supposed to

00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.190
feel bad dance with me

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:22.230
yeah he's like see you got more out well

00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:23.910
what sucks is a function of philosophy

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:26.490
backing my story right that's a sick

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:28.260
[ __ ] story the function of philosophy

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:30.690
was to continuously like figure out

00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:32.670
what's going on for people to talk and

00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:35.550
then it just got kind of like ruined by

00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:37.369
nerds basically yeah it's kind of like

00:59:37.369 --> 00:59:39.599
gets lined up with college and it's like

00:59:39.599 --> 00:59:41.099
supposed to be for just two people to

00:59:41.099 --> 00:59:42.990
talk all my philosophy result revolves

00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:45.540
around dogs thought for sure guy kicked

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.070
a dog when that teacher told me dogs

00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:47.940
don't have souls

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:50.130
I watched dog there's a dogs documentary

00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:51.180
so derp told me to watch this

00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:53.280

Bible and he was like what is this

01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:58.740

I got a preach the good was it's such a

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.440
funny [ __ ] thing that like he's a

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.369
respected preacher

01:08:08.369 --> 01:08:10.859
[ __ ] dudes always end up circling

01:08:10.859 --> 01:08:12.749
the drain around the Jew drain dude way

01:08:12.749 --> 01:08:13.710

01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:15.569
problems are the Jews yeah it is a fun

01:08:15.569 --> 01:08:18.600
is a funny story like well that now is

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.949
being the one that's being taught in

01:08:19.949 --> 01:08:22.889
schools just about white men the Jew

01:08:22.889 --> 01:08:25.020
conspiracy is now like white male

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:28.290
patriarchy what do you think of that

01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:30.139
that's what they teach in schools bro

01:08:30.139 --> 01:08:32.520
about what's that book the Zion the

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:35.339
protocols of Zion I don't know I think

01:08:35.339 --> 01:08:37.650
that was the first well that was like a

01:08:37.650 --> 01:08:40.650
major like wake up anti-semitism [ __ ]

01:08:40.650 --> 01:08:42.630
really yeah dude

01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:44.159
you think they're teaching the protocols

01:08:44.159 --> 01:08:46.949
of white dudes right now looks like a

01:08:46.949 --> 01:08:49.049
class yeah major they're literally I

01:08:49.049 --> 01:08:52.109
mean again you know I get part of this

01:08:52.109 --> 01:08:54.779
but pretty much like 1930s Jews for

01:08:54.779 --> 01:08:58.549
straight white dude pretty much just you

01:08:58.549 --> 01:09:01.230
know I mean they do count companies and

01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:02.130
like how many straight white guys

01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:04.440
working here you gotta fire them and

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.299
they're like yeah I mean I mean again

01:09:06.299 --> 01:09:07.500
though it's it's one of those things

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.730
where you gotta break up the boys club

01:09:08.730 --> 01:09:11.009
but it's not I don't think it's anywhere

01:09:11.009 --> 01:09:12.770
near the Holocaust but it's there

01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:14.759
there's parts of it that I don't think

01:09:14.759 --> 01:09:16.319
it's anywhere near the Holocaust no I

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.600
don't think so I don't think not yet you

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.040
don't think it's clearly the worst

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.870
they're gonna have a concentration camp

01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:23.069
or like I just don't get the internet

01:09:23.069 --> 01:09:26.400
and I'm like you see this like I just

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.250

are making fake diamonds it's such an

01:10:06.179 --> 01:10:08.489
alarming rate that like diamonds don't

01:10:08.489 --> 01:10:10.620
matter the value is dropping and it's

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:12.810
like De Beers is hiring an expert to try

01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:13.949
to figure out how to tell the difference

01:10:13.949 --> 01:10:15.810
is they can't as of yet tell the

01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:19.310
difference DeBeers had a good history

01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:22.020
that's crazy that companies

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.870
they're super evil dude I mean they

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:26.850
don't they hoard diamonds and inflate

01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:28.380
they like the market rate of diamonds

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.120

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.120

take a look

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.200
that'll ratchet them down a little bit

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.940
look you see how I live they see the

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:21.290
masses once once every five months they

01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:23.840
love me [ __ ] yeah dude yeah you can't

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.490
take her to a bad show though I mean if

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:27.170
you think of stock plummets any other

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:29.480
job is relatively boring and unglue rias

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.100
and even if you stand up if only once

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.690
every five months of roomful of people

01:13:32.690 --> 01:13:35.600
or just like that's pretty [ __ ] good

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.480
it's pretty it's pretty tight hell yeah

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.010
these are the thoughts where this is a

01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:41.330
drain I started struggling I saying I'm

01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:46.550
on a stage I'm like oh please suck my

01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:47.900
dick please I mean it kind of doesn't

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.240
work that way if you go if you do online

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.160
the combination of online dating and

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.550
being a decent stand-up comedian is like

01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:56.570
fish in a barrel brah

01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:59.930
you bring them out first date ever they

01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:01.910
meet you all they do is you just [ __ ]

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:04.130
smile upon them and you're on stage at

01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:05.660
the healing moment like crush and dude

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:06.710
and they don't have a [ __ ] choice

01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:09.760
dude but that's unfair but to do what

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.430
but to go home you didn't fog you we're

01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:14.690
like you know maybe on the third day

01:14:14.690 --> 01:14:16.490
you're definitely your you definitely

01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:18.320
you're doing that you've definitely

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.460
broke through their whatever their

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:20.870
mental barrier of like should I give

01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:22.070
this guy post you're not you've broken

01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:23.600
now it's a mess it's a matter of time

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.220
they like are no it sounds like the the

01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:27.370
groundwork for an erotic fiction

01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:29.570
maybe it's [ __ ] maybe it's a guy who

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:33.770
takes a girl to an open-mic next thing

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:35.150
you know you tied up in a basement

01:14:35.150 --> 01:14:37.190
getting hit with [ __ ] they seen though

01:14:37.190 --> 01:14:44.330
you're co-owners of the house and she's

01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:45.710
really meaning for some reason her stuff

01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:46.940
can be everywhere but if you have one

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.680
thing out say a toaster

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:50.600
it's the end of the [ __ ] world oh and

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:51.920
then when you point out the fact of the

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.990
hypocrisy of the situation you're now

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.490
like someone at her job who can't accept

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:57.140
[ __ ] criticism you're exactly like

01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:59.030
that guy at work mm-hmm

01:14:59.030 --> 01:15:01.310
her work husband mm-hmm you remind me of

01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:03.920
my work husband it's actually it's to

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.380
work enemy but it is one of those things

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:08.840
where it's like that I don't understand

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.030
it when it's just like all of their [ __ ]

01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:13.040
can be [ __ ] everywhere you have one

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.600
it's like you can put that away it's

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.000
like your shits literally we can't use

therapy every day if I wanted to I think

01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:49.010

01:15:50.210 --> 01:15:53.180
four times a week how do you think Freud

01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:55.390

01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:14.510
the mental diseases for a while that is

01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:16.430
called hysteria yeah chicks were getting

01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:17.450
his stately they would just be like

01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:19.640
inconsolable anxious and freaking out

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.630

going bonkers yeah yeah but get this so

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.440
Freud he's interviewing all these women

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.220
who are hysterical

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:36.230
and throw all the things they're saying

01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:38.300
like my father and he was doing like

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.220
these were like high society women my

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:42.140
father molested me my father molested me

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.910
my father molested me before he comes

01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:44.810
out I was like you know a lot of this

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:46.010
hysteria is from people getting molested

01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:48.260
and they were just like every dad is

01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:51.170
like you shut the [ __ ] off my profile do

01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:53.630
they're like nah bro I don't think you'd

01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:55.580
be it that's not coming out go back to

01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.500
the [ __ ] notebook dude 41 back and

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:58.940
came up with the term he's like women

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.860
secretly have rape fantasies and black

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:02.179
penis it like dude like

01:17:02.179 --> 01:17:04.639
we flip the script because he did that a

01:17:04.639 --> 01:17:05.329
couple times

01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:08.329
his dad originally one of the theories

01:17:08.329 --> 01:17:13.189
uh about like was like patricide or saw

01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:14.300
it was like one of his theories were

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.849
eventually like about like killing your

01:17:16.849 --> 01:17:18.260
dad and sadly that's [ __ ] and then

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:19.489
he was like yeah and he switched it to

01:17:19.489 --> 01:17:21.409
like the opposite he was like here's my

01:17:21.409 --> 01:17:22.639
theory on killing you dad

01:17:22.639 --> 01:17:25.369
yeah like that [ __ ] sucks his dead dad

01:17:25.369 --> 01:17:27.139
is that Boyd one of his theories and he

01:17:27.139 --> 01:17:29.209
did a total 180 his theory was I'm gonna

01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:31.249
[ __ ] kill you dad and he was like not

01:17:31.249 --> 01:17:33.139
there's something like that oh it was

01:17:33.139 --> 01:17:34.519
the opposite where his dad [ __ ] like

01:17:34.519 --> 01:17:35.900
crushed his theory and then his next

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.749
theory was like Patrick it's so funny

01:17:38.749 --> 01:17:40.999
[ __ ] I mean that's the test like what

01:17:40.999 --> 01:17:42.800
