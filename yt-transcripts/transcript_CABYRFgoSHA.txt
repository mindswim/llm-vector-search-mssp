thing after another a lot of a lot of

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.500

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.379
can fit in the set you know a lot of

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.180

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.959
two-time winner true it's no you can't

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.159
um what if you trans

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.599
serious question

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.780
do oh wow that's a yeah that's a hack to

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.159
get into the second time really this

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.900
time I'm trans and then you win and then

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.720
if you're the same person

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.720
that's true Same Spirit

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.700
yeah but no but your dead name one so no

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.379
that's a race from history they can't

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.239
bro and the second time is Jennifer and

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.680
then the third time you're gonna be like

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.200
a furry and I'm like what what are the

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.700
furry terms fursona

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.500
you would ditch Humanity altogether just

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.879
be animal kid he's like this is our

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.580
first Panda Philly's funniest winner or

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.919
you would go with a young age you give

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.419
them your little age and then be like

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.100
that technically you'd be back in time

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.139
yeah but I didn't win yet it's going to

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.000
be a perfect my little age it's gonna be

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.080
again

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.060
he's got so many options to just keep

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.620
winning murder you can establish a

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.040
one-man Dynasty funniest or non-binaries

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.160
human

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.720
I think so I think technically I think

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.060
they claim Humanity yeah I think all

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.040
people are human you're still human if

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.620
you're overly silly you know like just

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.880

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:58.860
thing he uh it's a he he's uh he's

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.420

he I gotta see that that's I think I'm

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.399
pretty sure that's how it works yeah

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.420
because that's what I want to tell

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.680
everybody you guys got to really dial

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.360
back your expectations of how you think

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.279
the thing was supposed to work like yeah

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:16.079
obviously initially it was blocking

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:18.480
everything it was perfect but now now

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.160
that the virus is mutated you guys gotta

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.779
all grow up man realize you you can

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:22.980
still test positive but you're still

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.720
well protected dude you're not far off

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.540
from how they like made the the uh the

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.220
vaccine I was like looking into it I

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.320
watched I watched maybe two 20-minute

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.279
YouTube videos on it yeah

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:37.200
research yeah the one thing they said

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:43.500
they said so the the MRNA is made to

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.220
attack the covid virus nice yeah so yeah

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.720
what you're saying is kind of right so

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.060
it hangs out yeah it's like they just

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.579
drinking coffee how long does it last in

00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:55.500
your body for once you get it I don't

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.000
know dude I don't know I think forever I

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.820
thought forever does it I don't know no

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.920
I thought it was just I thought it was I

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.360
thought the vaccine was just chilling

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.100
for like a cool year like it did like a

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.980
summer abroad in your body

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.420
and then they're like I gotta go back to

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.459
Connecticut

00:11:10.459 --> 00:11:13.620
yeah all the all the deadly strains are

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.440
like like they're out of style now so

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.380
yeah we're on like we're on the non-dead

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.760
lane we're on the good ones we're on the

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.140
common cold [ __ ] right if you get killed

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.420
by Kobe you should have died yeah I mean

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.480
now I would say now I mean now I mean

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.279
now no I think all of them I think they

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:31.079
all deserve it that's one way of putting

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:32.540
it I wouldn't

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.040
I heard anything the planet had six

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.440
million to burn how much was it what was

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.720
it sorry that's a weird I don't know it

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.000
sounds severely inflated no that was I

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.160
was thinking

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.740
I got my bad stuff mixed up my bad it's

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.620
probably 100 000 at most

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.079
yeah like there was like a survey like I

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.760
don't know I only have a I have a high

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.579
school education in one of my classes

00:11:56.579 --> 00:12:00.480
where they said uh v no uh Coatesville

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.459
area school it's called cash

00:12:04.459 --> 00:12:06.480
but yeah they said like there was going

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.440
to be a point where the population

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.060
reaches like there's so much and the

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.860
Earth's gonna have to like do its own

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.240
thing to like that's what I told you in

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.800
high school one of the yeah that was one

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.940
of like a theory they had about

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.740
population control so the Earth's gonna

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.380
kill you the Earth's gonna call like

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.180
it's going to keep like the Earth

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.920
like the Earth did your science teacher

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.950

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.799
thought Weird Al was jealous of him

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:16.020
what yeah Weird Al probably this is a

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.419
story

00:23:17.419 --> 00:23:20.159
is still this with a straight face I'm

00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:22.860
not kidding wait who told you this he

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.059
said this on

00:23:24.059 --> 00:23:26.820
um what was the podcast

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.919
um uh open Anthony WTF no I think it was

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:35.039
um calm down no no it was a smaller

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:37.799
podcast but he he's straight upset fresh

00:23:37.799 --> 00:23:39.980
air

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.659
right

00:23:45.659 --> 00:23:49.080
no but he he said he actually felt like

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.220
he was

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.779
like

00:23:51.779 --> 00:23:53.820
that there was no currency or something

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.279
which is like I mean he was dude he's a

00:23:56.279 --> 00:23:57.900
comedy God

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.880
so Al probably saw a trackman and was

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.960
like damn this motherfucker's fire

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.760
but Weird Al when he would have opening

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.980
acts they would they would they wouldn't

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.500
tour with him they never it would just

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.059
be picked by the venue and maybe

00:24:12.059 --> 00:24:14.279
somebody would do like so two different

00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:15.679
things

00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:17.820
have you confronted him about the fake

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.100

a whole thing and he like called me

00:25:30.419 --> 00:25:35.159
and and uh and he was really mad and I I

00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:37.200
like got to the bottom of this story

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.779
which is basically that he I'm like dude

00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:42.240

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.260
rebuttal

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.039
um

00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:52.380
basically he uh

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.659
he didn't really have much of a rebuttal

00:25:54.659 --> 00:25:57.179
he was just explaining his part in it

00:25:57.179 --> 00:25:58.740
that he threat did he threaten you at

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.159

00:26:10.679 --> 00:26:13.140
your research yeah true I went across

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.880
the forums you know the Weird Al Forums

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.059

00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:23.039
I looked up about the opening act and

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:24.840
and I figured you know does he switch up

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.460
City to city

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.460
um he used he used to just have opening

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:33.120
acts well that's as in his tours as in

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.220
his like setlist

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.620
um his uh his like

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.740
the the uh he did one tour that he did

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.020
that yeah but every other every other

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.080
tour is like a set set like he never got

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.400
caught up in any of that like pedophile

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.520
stuff did he nope dude his name is on

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.080

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.960
logs dude

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.100

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.659
the he was on the plane I think he was

00:26:57.659 --> 00:26:59.580
on the but like dude wait but also no

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.360
Weird Al couldn't even get on uh we are

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.460
the world you know what I mean he was

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.740
never that might be where he got the

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.059
pull from the biopic dude

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:28.700
[Laughter]

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.720
Weird Al rumors Weird Al not on the logs

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.340
Weird Al not a pedo it's going to show

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.380
up on me I wanna I wanna say the hetero

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.200
thing I'm not as it's okay you know I

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.000
don't you know of course you don't judge

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.279
but you're saying yeah he might got a

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:47.179
little sugar in the tank

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:49.679
yeah he's a pretty uh plays a rainbow

00:27:49.679 --> 00:27:51.720
accordion I don't know what I mean I I

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.820
don't think he would hide being gay no

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.380
no that's a thing you know what I mean I

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.320
don't think no be like oh he'd lose all

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.480
that mainstream appeal that he's got if

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.159
he were you know what I mean he's not

00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:03.419
mainstream he's made sure he is

00:28:03.419 --> 00:28:05.940
mainstream Joe um but I think you know

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.340
if you're homophobic you're Pro you

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.799
probably don't like Weird Al because

00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:12.500
you're judgmental

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.419
how do you think uh I I he I think if

00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:16.740
you don't like Weird Al you're

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.260
homophobic and if you don't like because

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.640
you're homophobic you don't like weird

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.919
there's like a yeah there's like a well

00:28:22.919 --> 00:28:24.659
I don't know why those two things are

00:28:24.659 --> 00:28:27.679
there's an overlap

00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:30.299
and doesn't like weird ass yeah it's

00:28:30.299 --> 00:28:32.580
true they're not they're not Westborough

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.159
Church hates Weird Al for sure God hates

00:28:35.159 --> 00:28:37.860
Weird Al Yankovic you know yeah Murdoch

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.120
I will say you are a beacon of Truth

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.100
everything you've said is 100 true I

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.899
can't I I want to argue I can't that's

00:28:42.899 --> 00:28:45.120
crazy anyone who's against gay dude sees

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.059
Weird Al goes [ __ ] that

00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:49.679
it's totally because he's weird it's

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:51.240
totally unrelated because he's weird

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.340
[ __ ] suspenders and mustaches he's

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.320
totally unrelated suspenders

00:28:57.919 --> 00:29:00.360
I don't think I've seen Weird Al and

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.980
suspenders So Weird Al's married right

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.140
he doesn't wear suspenders definitely

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.419
worse no he definitely worse please I

00:29:06.419 --> 00:29:07.860
think he worked wait hold on that's a

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.440
good question dude how do you think uh

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.880
Weird Al feels being the second best

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.640
accordion player of all time he's not a

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.080
real accordion player is he a real

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.899
according yeah dude of course is Jaleel

00:29:18.899 --> 00:29:20.760
White an accordion player dude I mean

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.140
he's method

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.140
Stefan yeah

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.539
he's method dude he's method as hell

00:29:27.539 --> 00:29:31.100
so where's the Spenders

00:29:36.659 --> 00:29:39.240
yeah he does play the accordion I wonder

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.520
who'd be better

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.740
white dude I mean first of all Weird Al

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.179
should acknowledge the fact that he

00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:48.779
completely just took over traditionally

00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:50.159
black instrument that's the accordion

00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:52.380
accordion yeah I thought that was like a

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.840
Mexican instrument what no dude

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.399
I don't know you know I don't know where

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:04.620
the accordion comes from from Africa

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.860
dude

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.200
I think it's Italy that feels yeah it

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.100
feels very well

00:30:19.399 --> 00:30:21.419
I can't believe said that but they

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:23.520
played it all across the world

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.559
Germany and then it went to Africa and

00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:26.940
then hit

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.159
where's Weird Al from where where's

00:30:29.159 --> 00:30:32.279
um Linwood California gotcha is he is he

00:30:32.279 --> 00:30:36.299
he's Jewish right nope really he's uh I

00:30:36.299 --> 00:30:39.960
think Yugoslavian uh that's that's a uh

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.100
that was something they made up when

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.299
they escaped the Holocaust I think

00:30:42.299 --> 00:30:44.520
there's like two or three yeah I thought

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.740
Weird Al was from Jersey dude nope

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.860

00:32:21.059 --> 00:32:23.159
why he's from California I thought he

00:32:23.159 --> 00:32:24.659
was straight out of New Jersey so did I

00:32:24.659 --> 00:32:26.640
I did think it was like a New York thing

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.260
yeah or something like that's where

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.940
really he was thinking about riding the

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.860
bus yeah because How brave is it to be

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.320
weird in California yeah it's not that

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.539
brave he wasn't Al until he left this he

00:32:36.539 --> 00:32:39.539
was just Al until he left the state yeah

00:32:39.539 --> 00:32:42.059
uh yeah murder do you think there's is

00:32:42.059 --> 00:32:44.039
there any does he have any Rivals like

00:32:44.039 --> 00:32:45.539

00:32:45.539 --> 00:32:47.659
that kind of thing everybody everybody

00:32:47.659 --> 00:32:50.820

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.580
he has no like like I mean Eminem had

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.559
Machine Gun Kelly like there's no

00:32:55.559 --> 00:32:57.720
[ __ ] I don't think so I don't think I

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.120
think it feels I think a lot of the

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.980
a lot of the people that have been the

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.779
most prominent have also had other

00:33:03.779 --> 00:33:06.240
things like a Lonely Island those guys

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.000
are do pretty well but they love Al they

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.120
haven't had them in a song though

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.080
song but they haven't had to wear it out

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.059
on a song No it's like a Weird Al

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:17.100

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.220
with uh you know all the spinal tap guys

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:39.200
he's he's not a you know I think he

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.179
uh that was like the first mockumentary

00:33:42.179 --> 00:33:44.640
whether the rock band you ever hear like

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.100
these ones go to 11 no you don't know

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.340
that no oh man yeah it's some white

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.580
[ __ ]

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.740
it's a white classic only mockumentary I

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.000
like is the office

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.179
true what's uh what's what's Weird Al's

00:34:00.179 --> 00:34:01.679
political leading

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:04.320
um I heard he's a hardcore trumpist

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.000
um no he's

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.140
he's

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.020
um I think he's Democrat but doesn't

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.820
doesn't you know lecture people doesn't

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.079
really like where did you get this

00:34:13.079 --> 00:34:14.639
where'd you get his political leading

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:15.599
from

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:16.800
um

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.839
are you projecting your political party

00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:20.899
on Weird Al

00:34:20.899 --> 00:34:22.500
uh

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.040
uh well I don't know I think I okay I

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.260
don't know

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.639
no but I think he is a little more left

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:32.220
lane just just important that he's made

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:35.399
and little statements when asked and put

00:34:35.399 --> 00:34:37.560
on the spot but he doesn't try to like

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.500
he doesn't want to do like a trump song

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.139
what's weird who would want to like the

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.060
Trump song would be old now if you did a

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.500
trump song yeah but like a pro Trump

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.240
song

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.800
um a pro con song about like you know he

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.800
doesn't do political comedy at all nope

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.960
what's Weird Al's real name

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.079
Alfred Matthew Yankovic okay so weird Al

00:35:01.079 --> 00:35:03.660

he's the Dice Man or something which is

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:37.260

an affair with Tila Tequila that'd be

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.520
bad that'd be amazing no he can do

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.680

maybe Al loves to write Alfred Yankovic

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.700
not so much true although dude you don't

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.200
think on the road

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.160
just just once bro he's a pretty focused

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.720
guy you know like you know what I mean

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.339
exactly but a lot of times those dudes

00:38:17.339 --> 00:38:18.839
who hyper Focus like that need to really

00:38:18.839 --> 00:38:22.640
need to crack open I don't know I

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:27.540
think he he you know he really uh

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.780
he uh runs like a tight ship you know I

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.460
mean he doesn't get uh prince Andrew

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.140
said he ran a tight ship too and he was

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.460
[ __ ] he was on a lot but yeah Weird

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.220
Al not on the logs we established that

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.079
uh he's very much he's [ __ ]

00:38:40.079 --> 00:38:42.960
meticulous dude he doesn't like he's he

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.940
doesn't like get near an air conditioner

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.460
because it might ruin his voice really

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.560
well he stays at air conditioning that's

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.920
what I heard in an interview so yeah

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.300
doesn't want to wrinkle his skin he's a

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.300
vampire check that

00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:01.140
he's yeah he doesn't talk much before a

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.560
show Dory he's very conserves his voice

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.320
so yeah he's probably he probably uh

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.420
still saves up the cup of Hermes as well

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.740
people have been talking about Michael

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.720
Jackson's real voice regular guy

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.359
actually that's the weirdest thing of

00:39:27.359 --> 00:39:29.460
all he's just chill he's now he's just

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.640
is that he's the normalist guy in all of

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.980
Hollywood he's just that's weird

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.260
that's the weird part whoa you don't

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.060
think he has any kinks

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.460
he definitely does look at that oh

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.540
that's what I'm trying to get it maybe

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.960
on some some very private personal level

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.060
that like that's where the Kinks happen

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.619
but that's why he's weird dude you're

00:39:49.619 --> 00:39:51.920
right everything else is normal

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.300
you think he's I'd be willing to Grant

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.339
him this he's the most normal dude ever

00:39:56.339 --> 00:40:00.480
but he does wear a butt plug 24 7.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.560
Fair

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.660
uh I don't I don't believe there's any

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.359
evidence to suggest

00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:08.160
he's not fat he's not ruling it out

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.960
though true I mean yeah you can't nobody

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.400
can know nobody knows who's playing

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.260
technically can't know that dude I bet

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.119
he talked about it's not within the uh

00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:19.020
you know cousin lines of the public uh

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.119
you know any one of us could have a

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:22.099
buffalo

00:40:22.099 --> 00:40:24.960
it doesn't matter at all yeah you know

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.220
what I'm saying why is it being brought

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.020
up you know what I'm saying he could be

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.480
wearing a vibrating Buffalo

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.119
see what you're saying is yet he what's

00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:35.160
his secret he can't yeah what there has

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.680
to be something hiding nothing bad I

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.579
mean there's nothing wrong with wearing

00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:41.579
a butt plug 24 7. I'm saying I think

00:40:41.579 --> 00:40:43.800
there's something I we got to get to the

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.880
bottom of this and maybe it's in the

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.280
biopic all right maybe the butt plug

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.140

maybe maybe he has like one toe that's

00:40:57.359 --> 00:41:00.300
like bigger than the others do you think

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.420

00:52:20.819 --> 00:52:23.760
then and then went home you know yeah

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.460
and uh you know always keep my distance

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:29.339
from people especially large groups

00:52:29.339 --> 00:52:32.339
especially yes that look like they're

00:52:32.339 --> 00:52:34.140
just standing there for some odd reason

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.660
at one o'clock in the morning anytime

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:37.980
it's a group of kids sitting anywhere

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:40.020
you better watch it [ __ ] out dude I feel

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.339
like nobody's afraid of black dudes

00:52:41.339 --> 00:52:42.420
anymore

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:45.240
I feel like they lost the sauce

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.280
that's that's because

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.440
I think as soon as Murdoch out ran for

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.200

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.839

00:52:54.839 --> 00:52:56.400
dude it's the way the places where they

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.319
intersect or the those are the docile

00:52:58.319 --> 00:53:00.720
black people so we're not gonna [ __ ]

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.400
encroach on the white people go behind

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.579
those borders go beyond those borders

00:53:05.579 --> 00:53:07.579
Joe went beyond those borders

00:53:07.579 --> 00:53:11.119
and found out

00:53:11.119 --> 00:53:12.680
no

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:16.200
I'm not proud of it it was uh it was it

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.319

00:53:19.319 --> 00:53:23.300

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.619
yeah

00:53:28.619 --> 00:53:30.540
in the end what else what other scary

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.339
situations have you been in that's

00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:34.859
pretty scary that is scary uh weird

00:53:34.859 --> 00:53:37.200
situations the cops bother you when you

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.700
live there sometimes because they're

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.800
like they think I think if you're in

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.960
North Phillies particularly before the

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.440
word gentrification was very popular uh

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.480
like you know like like 10 years ago

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.339
people think I'm out there looking for

00:53:50.339 --> 00:53:52.040
drugs

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:57.119
yeah basically and you know I'm like I

00:53:57.119 --> 00:53:59.579

00:53:59.579 --> 00:54:01.140
place and I couldn't remember the

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.180
address right offhand and the cop asked

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:05.040
like what's your address and I'm like I

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.020
can't right off hand I can't really like

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.359
