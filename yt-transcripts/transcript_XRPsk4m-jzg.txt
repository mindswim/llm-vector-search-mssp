00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.450
like terms of like they're forming like

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.400
close-knit communities out like the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.870
Midwest and it's like they'll take over

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.660
a town and is revamping everyone's on a

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.200
1950's lifestyle fetish it's where it's

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.420

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.200
like took it easy at the Latin and stuff

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.030
you don't need to do this in Latin

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.280
they're like full force on all of it and

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.660
they live like that to take over the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.130
town center and like apparently

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.390

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.360
able to focus on the ground hard clothes

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.160
even rock hard it was like they can't

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.060
give it their all for

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.139
worried about bumping into a female

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.520
referee out of respect because they're

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.800
so respectful they're gonna be excuse me

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.910

refused according to the reporter they

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.370
refused to play because they're like be

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.810
kind of disrespectful to be like running

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.980
up and down real fast around the

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.380
scrolling white spooker okay people are

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.000
flocking out apparently is doing pretty

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.080
well that's where we should build a

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.350
studio how Dan SPX is out there and be

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.600
like yes dude you need to cover your

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.850
head at mass the whole mass needs to be

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.700
in Latin the priests face is the other

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.190
way I'm pretty sure the mass I'm pretty

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.440
sure they're full back to it but they're

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.729
they also there's the other thing too

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.260
when like the church backpedaled on like

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.790
how like they're like yeah being gay

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.020
he's not that big of a deal they're like

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.729
we're going back to like no no it's

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.800
pretty big deal yeah they're like yeah

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.960
no you can't do gay know being gay and

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.760
like the same thing with like the the

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.350
town pool apparently got shut down was

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.280
they didn't with the boys to see the

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.600
girls and like bathing suits and [ __ ]

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.450
yeah so it's pretty legit like that but

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.919
they do do shut it down they use

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.470
electricity to use everything but

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.850
they're just like you go to the it was

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.440
look like a normal town but if you have

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.640
people in there and they're [ __ ]

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.030
there they're wacko old school Catholic

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.050
do they have a picture of the dude in

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.729
his family him and his six kids they're

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.140

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.640
bring back the Klan out there someone's

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.840
gonna be like we need to [ __ ] these

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.200
Catholics up again I mean they're gonna

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.860
instill some other town to be like what

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.570
if we go back to remember what we were

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.000
doing [ __ ] these Catholics do you think

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.020
some proudest things are gonna go back

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.820
that's why the props were doing that how

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.410
the prostitutes all about being weird

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.300
prostitutes off now because there was

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.410
like they were talking about the old

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.510
neighbors who were kind of like you know

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.250
like oh man we used to we lived here

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.450
before and they're you know probably

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.979
just some like wasps there's like it's

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:12.389
out like a nice area in the Midwest

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.100
we're just normal Catholics if you were

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.010
just a boy like this is crazy might not

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.570
even wasps there's regular people living

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.830
in a town they're like it's like the

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.660
member that would make the Indian guru

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.090
dude movie goes down it's like that but

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:30.630
with like just Notre Dame fans they're

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.250
all upset there's a black leprechaun no

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.680
I don't know they never get racial

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.750
racially I'm sure they're great because

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.409
that was never really instilled in any

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:40.699
teacher

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.069
true oh I mean yeah if you got down with

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.629
it I'm sure but I don't know it's hard

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:46.090
to say I think not in the fifties

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.029
Catholics were like pro civil rights

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:52.099
okay so like if they're like Notre Dame

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:53.960
was like at the front of that at the

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.430
forefront yeah they were fighting the

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.289
Klan dude I mean if you went down there

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:58.789
and you were just like super respectful

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:00.139
they would probably be pretty cool about

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:03.050
it I I'm guessing but there's also that

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.360
purse that same personality type that's

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.909
being like we got a revoked Vatican -

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:10.610
yeah I would suspect would just be like

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.110
if you were to match the one black

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.759
family that might be [ __ ] like

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:17.689
squeezing his forehead in church but

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:19.699
again I don't know dude these people

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:22.069
might be on the I I don't know it's like

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:23.300
anything else half a probably would be

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.310
some eyebrows wiggling Weatherly I don't

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.719
know it's either there it's either I'm

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:35.000
gonna check his taxes but I don't know

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.659
they're probably or that or they're just

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:41.289
overly just up in the black family's ass

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:44.779
face like we love you so much that could

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:46.550
be the case I mean let's take another

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.830

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.000
good worker dude good boy yeah he'd

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.130
[ __ ] keep his head down he'd find him

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.929
he'd find it but he'd find BAE

00:25:53.929 --> 00:25:57.200
oh my god find it good chaste BAE no

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.750
birth control so it's like you just keep

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.550
having kids dude yeah he's a guy the

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:03.260
ones mud seems like he'd be a guy with

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.200
like eight kids for sure yeah down in SP

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.990
XX he might go down there and tear it

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:13.160
down I think you get excommunicated

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.020
pretty quickly yeah

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.830
he's not one to filter himself so really

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.460
yeah

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.920
dude so I also read there's another

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.870
article in the Atlantic about deep-sea

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.850
exploration you [ __ ] with the deep-sea

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.340
at all uh-uh yeah what the Marianas

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.830
Trench or what you know about it no

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.240
metal trenches you know about a you're

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.740
about the guy the underwater hot springs

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.140
you guys yeah yeah it's the that's where

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.580
the the soup it's where the soup comes

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.150
done your research

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.950
I just know about us what are the what

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.890
are the real soup what are the zones

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.380
what do you mean oh different oh yeah

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.330
yeah yeah I don't remember him now blue

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:56.020
zone twilight zone the abyss and then

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.210
the Hazel's own is below the abyss yeah

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.280
no one's no gated down there no one can

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.350
get to the halo you only james care who

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.080
tried his [ __ ] failed his screens [ __ ]

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.610
started cracking and breaking yeah it

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:07.570
couldn't handle the pressure and i

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.160
Seraphin i think he went to the abyss i

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.180
don't think he went down to the hey

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.700
dole's own dude cuz they're scary so

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.900
they're gonna mine they're gonna start

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.030
mining the very very bottom of the ocean

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.290
cuz there's a ton of minerals down there

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.420
but nobody knows what the [ __ ] down

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.460
there so there's a bunch of scientific

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.600
rim dude so you get Godzilla's oh all

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.950
these things are gonna come out Mothra's

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:30.400
do these big moths your dancer myron or

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.360
dude you're gonna get like an ancient

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.940
monster but they're the warriors they're

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.380
kicking up they're gonna kick just dust

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.090
up everywhere all throughout the ocean

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:40.300
they're like yeah yeah okay but the ten

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.100
dudes are gonna get rich so they're

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.010
gonna get [ __ ] baby there's their

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:46.840
signing contracts right now two people

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.180
getting like thousands of miles of the

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.830
ocean at a clip or they just get the

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.150
troll it with little things and just

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.100
stir up crap and just like pull up and i

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.180
don't want to be like far they like

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.560
there's gonna pull up iphone batteries

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.400
yeah and this get [ __ ] paid but ii

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.960
think so there's all the china you get a

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.600
hold of this well china is gonna [ __ ]

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.550
the oceans ass do you think Chinese

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.290
atlantis is down on the handle zone with

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:16.000
all the cellphone batteries dude oh yeah

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.230
dude well it's our the race is already

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.630
on but the weird thing is so there's hot

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.610
springs down there and they've they have

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.380
studied like the life form so there's no

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.330
light no oxygen and it's like you said

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.040
it's a chemical soup and there is

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.830
organisms thrive munching on that munch

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:32.050
on that stuff yeah so it begs the

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.050
question on like what's a fiery planet

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:35.410
like

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.900
Saturn or was Pluto with no that's cold

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:43.179
what's a real fiery planet Venus yeah

00:28:43.179 --> 00:28:44.890
they're all very spooky very what's one

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.539
that's just gas which one is that I'm

00:28:46.539 --> 00:28:48.700
not sure I would say Venus is it very

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.710
fun yes yeah maybe I don't know or

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:55.929
Uranus so here's what I'm thinking so if

00:28:55.929 --> 00:28:57.700
there's stuff living if there's

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.190
organisms in that fatal zone or you know

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.929
not to get too technical yeah down in

00:29:01.929 --> 00:29:03.850
the hey down in the [ __ ] there's like

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.169
Grand Canyon's in the ocean which is

00:29:05.169 --> 00:29:06.760
crazy think about with [ __ ] hot

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.789
springs shooting up chemicals so if you

00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:11.530
have life-forms in that there could be

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:13.210
little life forms in those planets that

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.309
we can't really approach and if there

00:29:15.309 --> 00:29:16.510
you could if there could have been life

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:19.240
that has evolved on gaseous planets we

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.669
could have get intelligent gas forms

00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:23.520
that are flying around in outer space

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:29.110
that's what ghosts are dude come on give

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:31.960
it up give it up come on so you think

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.780
ghosts are intelligent gas worms from

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.750
from Venus yeah dude they just say they

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:38.980
the only thing they can do everything

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.960
they just can't since their gas they

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.760
have a hard time manipulating physical

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.530
realities knock over like a cup that's a

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.850
hole they can do dude they're just like

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.010
[ __ ] the only one they get mad at so

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.740
hard like trying to save our planet like

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:59.380
stop it shut up they just slammed the

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.640
door and you're like that must be the

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.549
wind anyway anyway so I was jerking off

00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:05.830
to this [ __ ] show this is ancient

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.140
[ __ ] sentient life that just floated

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.400
I figured it all out

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.830
it was i'm cold what the [ __ ] is this

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.320
why am i chilly all of a sudden ooh oh

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.720
man yeah dude I was bugging out on the

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.820
hate old zone it's it is scary just

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.470
confirms more dude I'm telling you I

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:21.490
keep coming into things that just

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:25.179
confirm my research giant squids they're

00:30:25.179 --> 00:30:26.470
spooky yeah

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.150
sperm whales and giant squid down there

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.730
just fighting oh for sure so scary

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:32.650
terrifying it's so scary to know that in

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.950
like pitch-black water in like freezing

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.020
cold pitch-black water some sperm whales

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:42.640
fighting of [ __ ] there's a methane

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.919
jet it releases all over them there's

00:30:44.919 --> 00:30:47.500
little things eating it dude it's [ __ ]

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.669
up the finger

00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:50.080
so there's just there's [ __ ] down there

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.029
we have no [ __ ] idea there might as

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:53.950
well be aliens in the bottom of the

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:55.480
ocean you have no [ __ ] clue what they

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.919
do that's them that's the real final

00:30:56.919 --> 00:30:59.109
frontier it dude literally the bottom of

00:30:59.109 --> 00:31:00.159
the ocean we don't know it's not it's

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:02.289
hard to go ahead and guess it's mud and

00:31:02.289 --> 00:31:04.749
[ __ ] stop dude it's [ __ ] there's there's

00:31:04.749 --> 00:31:06.399
gold down there there's all kinds

00:31:06.399 --> 00:31:08.080
there's a ton of moon rocks and [ __ ]

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.379
yeah dude Grand Canyon's geysers dude

00:31:11.379 --> 00:31:13.269
it's literally they tried putting the

00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:15.700
most sophisticated scientists made like

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.220
a 30 million dollar robot dropped it to

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.019
the bottom and they're like we got this

00:31:20.019 --> 00:31:22.720
dude I think they like did all the tests

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.119
all the physics floated to the top like

00:31:25.119 --> 00:31:26.950
two days later and a bunch of pieces

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.139
yeah it's millions of pounds of pressure

00:31:29.139 --> 00:31:30.970
as soon as you go down lower just

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:32.499
[ __ ] crunch it you can't get down

00:31:32.499 --> 00:31:34.059
there it's scary it's harder to get to

00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:35.289
the bottom of the ocean than in outer

00:31:35.289 --> 00:31:39.100
space obviously yeah it's spooky down

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.869
there dude it's it's literally the

00:31:40.869 --> 00:31:42.190
spookiest have you have you have you

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:44.529
seen like just fish from the abyss I've

00:31:44.529 --> 00:31:52.149
snorkel before 9 feet I've poached the

00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:54.369
blue zone a little bit no I can't you

00:31:54.369 --> 00:31:55.779
know I'm not gonna brag I can snorkel

00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:57.460
and plug it up with my tongue deep dive

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.859
down and come back up

00:31:58.859 --> 00:32:01.359
Naing down so I'm pretty good so I'm

00:32:01.359 --> 00:32:03.669
like basically a pearl diver yeah true

00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:05.080
I can go down pretty but so you got that

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.879
surfers eye you get into it probably

00:32:09.879 --> 00:32:14.049
from all the snoring what I did I'm

00:32:14.049 --> 00:32:16.029
bugging on deep sea the fact that

00:32:16.029 --> 00:32:17.739
there's literally things that could have

00:32:17.739 --> 00:32:19.139
been down there for billions of years

00:32:19.139 --> 00:32:21.399
evolving you know we've been what we

00:32:21.399 --> 00:32:23.649
evolved out of like plasma or whatever

00:32:23.649 --> 00:32:27.369
junk sea junk don't tell that the SX SS

00:32:27.369 --> 00:32:29.919
people getting [ __ ] flogged oh they

00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:31.749
were Hey Dude they were a mystic like me

00:32:31.749 --> 00:32:33.369
they would [ __ ] off freak out at me I'm

00:32:33.369 --> 00:32:35.559
a heretic they would burn you probably

00:32:35.559 --> 00:32:37.419
honestly in a different century I would

00:32:37.419 --> 00:32:39.789
I would orchestrate your burning dude

00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:41.859
I'm like Giordano Bruno dude exactly

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:45.210
that's exactly who I was thinking of

00:32:45.749 --> 00:32:48.489
dude I was reading uh I wasn't reading I

00:32:48.489 --> 00:32:51.009
was watching their YouTube video I like

00:32:51.009 --> 00:32:53.320
it there's a little honesty well lionize

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.600
you're reading but I'll say there was

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.940
text on screen that I did read but yeah

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.639
technically I did read parasite trill

00:33:00.639 --> 00:33:02.380
that's fair enough

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.200
dude Schopenhauer what do you know about

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:05.730
him

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:09.070
not much going to him what's he up to

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.020
so it's again I had I just been

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.730
following my intuition here I'm watching

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.309
all this there's like just follow my

00:33:15.309 --> 00:33:16.929
intuition ears there's school of thought

00:33:16.929 --> 00:33:19.030
right there's a school of life I use

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.320
watching they're like breakdown like

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.610
philosophers and stuff so I'd like watch

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:22.840
a little breakdown there it was that way

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.460
I'm not gonna read some old dusty book

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.140
and then like I can watch a summary and

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.400
it's like oh this is what this guy was

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.799
after and it's like I'm cool on that for

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:31.120
some reason that Schopenhauer when I'm

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.410
like I didn't no idea what he was about

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.970
but I'm like damn this guy's [ __ ] seems

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:36.669
sick then I watched the academy of ideas

00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:39.100
video about show power two-parter dude

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:43.900
his whole his whole bar so I'm like I'm

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.220
like I love getting there like their

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.600
whole it's nice how you could condense

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.400
like a philosopher's life work in like

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.590
24 minutes pretty [ __ ] sick yeah you

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.830
know so like basically he came to the

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.650
conclusion that there all life is is

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.840
just it's just will its blind will and

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.370
blind forest with up from like the

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.289
bottomless level to the very top we're

00:34:02.289 --> 00:34:04.480
just like dogs cats human beings and all

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.440
we're doing it's just kind of like

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.929
urging just urging forward out of like

00:34:07.929 --> 00:34:09.700
weird anxiety and doom instincts and

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.710
it's nothing more than a tangle of just

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.080
things eating each other yeah exactly I

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.000
figured you'd be kind of into this so

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.429
any sounds like something you'd like

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:22.720
doom and yeah everything's just [ __ ]

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.369
and eating and [ __ ] so his whole

00:34:24.369 --> 00:34:25.899
philosophy is like that's the reality of

00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:27.879
that's the reality of our world and be

00:34:27.879 --> 00:34:29.710
you don't we can never gain an objective

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:31.210
understanding on the world outside of

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.800
our own psychic phenomenon we just look

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.540
at stuff make up stories about it but in

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.399
the end of it we're just walking around

00:34:36.399 --> 00:34:38.169
we've just staved off all the things

00:34:38.169 --> 00:34:40.510
that are trying to eat us for now and he

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:41.919
was talking about like an explorer get

00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:44.950
to that Mothra still be [ __ ] on the

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:47.109
bottom due to those [ __ ] gasps ghosts

00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:48.550
come from out of space I go actually

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:52.179
figured out how to push buttons down but

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:55.090
the so he was like you so he's like

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.440
that's and there was an explorer do they

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.640
had a picture of it it looked really

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.140
[ __ ] up how come a ghost never did

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.940
that push the new cliff ghosts are

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.710
knocking over cops and [ __ ] dude don't

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.000
tell how much [ __ ] one of the ghosts

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.609
might be like oh yeah listeners we have

00:35:08.609 --> 00:35:10.930
Joe this [ __ ] for they came from [ __ ]

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:12.520
Pluto like this [ __ ] [ __ ] I mean

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.020
technically we've been doing this

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.420
podcast long enough that

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.540
of our listeners it has died true true

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:18.930
that

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.970
oh no no doubt steadily been a listener

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.430
that's died hi I would say probably like

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:26.760
10 yeah they saw are a couple o DS in

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.780
our [ __ ] group alright peace I peed

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.430
all the dead dogs do a shout-out to the

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.319
dog sleep or one fr like World War two

00:35:34.319 --> 00:35:46.380
statistics dude doesn't bode yeah so and

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.670
he's talking about this Explorer who was

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:48.809
like sitting there the one day and he

00:35:48.809 --> 00:35:50.490
was like he was like just chilling in

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:52.440
the tall grass and he saw a what the

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.809
[ __ ] was it there was like a some sort

00:35:54.809 --> 00:35:56.970
of bird died and like dog started eating

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.240

[ __ ] christ

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.680
so he's like that's the nature of

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.630
reality and then all week so that's our

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.160
that's always it's just hard to watch

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.869
that stuff's hard to watch like that

00:36:12.869 --> 00:36:15.690
nature is metal stuff that like yeah man

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:16.920
there's something in there that I just

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.960
hate oh it's horrible

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.790

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.819
fence oh and the [ __ ] I forget whose

00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:37.530
it was like a tweet that was like this

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.260

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:45.839
silence like a lone it was like whoa so

00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:50.730
kangaroos do died in immense pain alone

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.010
none of them died on their deathbed like

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:54.390
I had a good time

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.700
do you ever hear the island of monkeys

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.440
that like a guy has to take care of now

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.390
their research month and they were like

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.040
on an island and the companies were just

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.359
like [ __ ] putting all these fucked-up

00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:04.829
chemicals in him and then they were like

00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:06.720
oh [ __ ] the funding got shut down and

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.980

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:20.119
me is gonna get mauled

00:37:20.119 --> 00:37:23.369

00:37:23.369 --> 00:37:25.859
will well maybe he's gonna I mean that's

00:37:25.859 --> 00:37:27.299
like Grizzly Man once the unnamed

00:37:27.299 --> 00:37:29.280
isotope 44

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.570
go out in the wild they have no survival

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:32.280
skills and they're like they've been

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.320
injected with tons of diseases to study

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.790
with diseases they're just diseased

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:37.800
monkeys on an island and he's like

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.630
petitioned like governments down there

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:40.500
was like you guys they're like

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.670
third-world government's or like dude

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.360
[ __ ] off

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.800
yeah I mean if you get a government

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.330
involved they're just gonna kill every

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:46.800
monkey they're some billionaire was like

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.080
I'll fund it somebody needs to kill

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.520
those because they're like bioweapons

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:50.970
dude

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.800
somebody needs to put them down someone

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.180
watch plan of the Apes like I could do

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.320
that it was like oh no they just have

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.940
diseases now and then some guy is just

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.290
like what the [ __ ] and he just sits

00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:59.310
there and lives with them and or he

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.150
doesn't live with them but he like

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.740
drives over boats of bananas every

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.900
single day he's due to cost like

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.280
thousands of dollars to keep these

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.320
monkeys alive and there's a some

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.490
billionaire in New York who is like

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.730
[ __ ] fine yeah it's like I don't know

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:15.810
dude djt might have to [ __ ] drone

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:20.340
strike there's gonna be some [ __ ] up

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.080
disease it comes out of there yeah for

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.930
sure but either way but the I don't

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:25.830
thing I was like a research I know I

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:27.000
remember he was a dude who just like

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.470
worked with them in some weird capacity

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.840
and was just like well the [ __ ] that's

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.450
it and they're like we're done here's a

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:34.860
two weeks the [ __ ] out of here yes I

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.150
know it sucks we got to find new jobs

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:38.280
he's like what about these guys yes like

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.930
they you think they all personalities I

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:42.330
know they of course so but the second

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:43.590
part of the Schopenhauer stuff is like

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.120
once you've realized you're like it all

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.040
it is is blind will every single

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.110
organism everything he's just [ __ ]

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:51.240
pulse it towards something you know for

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.080
its own benefit you think the next part

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.900
is recognizing how you move around and

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.730
that's all you're just trapped in a loop

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:01.440
of the future of reward and how you're

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.490
just kind of like you have it one day

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.110
but one day and he's like it never does

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.910
you get your reward and like the pain

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.320
and agony goes away for a second and

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.940
then you just get bored which inspires

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.420
more pain and agony and you go forward

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.470
and then you just go forward again like

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.240
no this is what I'm gonna do yeah so his

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.620
whole thing was like it sounds

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.720
fatalistic but his whole his whole idea

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.280
was that like that's that's what it is

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.930
and you have to completely transcend

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:24.030
will in and of itself wait you just went

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.380
to like he became like an Indian mystic

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.240
basically and was just like so begin

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.980
well the whole point of that story is

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.590
not to bore you is to say all of the

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:33.330
things I'm reading all lead to mysticism

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.180
dude Schopenhauer I didn't had there was

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.100
nothing about mysticism that came about

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.230
it I started researching on BAM at the

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.910
end start tell about the up and shots

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:42.500
and

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.339
[ __ ] I think that's good philosophy

00:39:44.339 --> 00:39:46.799
never gives you a real answer and the

00:39:46.799 --> 00:39:48.480
only answer ever is to be like you just

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.450
gotta shut off not all the time not

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.549
everybody there's almost no answer in

00:39:53.549 --> 00:39:55.260
philosophy no I always hated about it

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.380
true you know well yeah I was like

00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.579
here's my theory and then somebody be

00:39:59.579 --> 00:40:02.069
like no that's wrong here's the theory

00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:04.349
oh he dude he claims like he claims to

00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:06.480
be like I have the end-all be-all

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.950
is is really basically was like you guys

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:09.779
can stop now this is what it is it's

00:40:09.779 --> 00:40:11.819
kind of right everything's just trying

00:40:11.819 --> 00:40:14.819
to [ __ ] push itself forward and again

00:40:14.819 --> 00:40:16.650
I've I've talked about for since I was a

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:17.819
kid I always been like everything's

00:40:17.819 --> 00:40:19.500
instinct everything we've ever

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.779
everything we do or say or act on is

00:40:21.779 --> 00:40:23.460
just instinct sure I don't think there's

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:27.450
much free will yeah well that's he said

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:30.150
I yeah that's a good point because I've

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.589

00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:35.910
lately so yeah but how about the fact

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.200
that I infiltrated your dreams today

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.140
dude that's got to bug you out that is

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.599
the first time you've actually proven

00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:44.160
yourself to be a [ __ ] clairvoyant

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.160
real shaman dude this was intense

00:40:58.769 --> 00:41:00.349
read yesterday they're talking about

00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:02.400
there was a study where they did it they

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.200
try to place images in people's dreams

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.940
while there someone was sleeping there

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.140
was a guy who would try to place like an

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.839
image you know it was like more more

00:41:08.839 --> 00:41:11.190
likely than like chance that like people

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:13.289
would have actually like ESP things

00:41:13.289 --> 00:41:14.940
projected in their dreams I'm all in the

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.470

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:29.549
desert I call the elliptical the

00:41:29.549 --> 00:41:30.809
tesseract okay

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:36.359
hit the elliptical and the first thing

00:41:36.359 --> 00:41:38.039
in the morning and I do it for 15

00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:39.690
minutes and I just work and I send

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:42.180
people good energy I said at 7:42

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.980
I'm sound was like this I'm working up a

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.720
ball there's tons of light people don't

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.559
can't see this but there's a

00:41:46.559 --> 00:41:48.930
metaphysical [ __ ] storm around me I'm

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:50.490
sending them off to everyone I know

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.170
that's the tesseract dude I go there the

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:54.150
beaver said bad energy people no I never

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:55.240

00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:00.520
I'm not a dark shaman but hey I actually

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.440
do that without thinking I'm just on the

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.240
treadmill you know [ __ ] that [ __ ]

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:09.130
doesn't work out for him so there's

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:10.180
nothing bad about that it's just a

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.820
certain polarity so I'm like I'm pushing

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.740
dude on the tesseract and I'm like this

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:15.940
I'm something like I'm sending Shane

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:17.410
good energy right now and I'm like I

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:19.030
wonder if I can [ __ ] infiltrate his

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.070
dreams and I started I try to send you

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.390
an elephant the first thing came to my

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:24.310
mind I started going first I sent you my

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:25.930
little golden ball of energy I told you

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.550
about that sent you that I was like

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:28.720
maybe that he'll see that's flying

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.860
around like a little the Golden Snitch

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.440
and then I was like a gigantic elephant

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.700
I'm trying to channel images into your

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.320
dreams and then what happens I come see

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.250

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:38.140
chain did you have any dreams what

dreams I made it through I was trying to

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.880
send symbols in there boom I'm so weird

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.680
the first thing you said was like you

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.820

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.340

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:03.790
dream was you me had a bunch of money

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:07.660
mm-hm and I it was drug money and I hid

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:10.660
it in a couch in my house and a dude

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.340
came over and stole it [ __ ]

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.359
and then it was like what do we do we

00:43:13.359 --> 00:43:16.270
gotta kill him story of my life I guess

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:18.700
we just gotta cut our losses and be like

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.530
alright that money's his all you can do

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.730
bro can't kill him wow that was my dream

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:25.630
interesting as an interview were my

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.150
dream though very interesting and it was

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:29.980
around the time around 7 probably right

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.140
around that time I was oh yeah that's

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:36.580
that's a tesseract Ezreal a lot of deep

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.290
a lot of deep REM right before waking

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:40.450
hours awesome I was 7 42 Shane's

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.220
probably in like stage 4 REM right now I

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.780
could probably infiltrate his dreams and

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.630
I did pretty excited about it

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:49.230
gonna try to do it to some more people

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:52.180
it's not gonna work ever again I mean

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.700
dude for I'm one for one right now yeah

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.460
but that was pure fluke you're talking

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.650
that's just pure synchronicity no you

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:02.109
just happen to be in my dream you said

00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:04.390
so yourself II never dream about me no I

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:07.330
said I don't I rarely dream okay

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:08.730
but now I've

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:10.710
back on the booze that's why oh you get

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:13.350
REM rebound yeah you get an REM rebound

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.270
right now yeah that's what the pink

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:18.060
elephants come from you literally stop

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:19.470
sleeping so much that your REM sleep

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.390
kicks in while you're awake

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:22.830
that's why alcoholics start to loosen

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:24.960
eight yeah well I don't have that

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.090
obviously not but I'm saying that's why

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:28.380
I never knew I have coholic loosen it

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.690
that's why yeah they stopped getting REM

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:32.580
sleep in their bodies like look man we

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.020
need to do some sort of we're gonna toss

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.340
something out isn't that weird though

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.230
your body needs to enter into like a

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:39.420
total [ __ ] fantasy realm otherwise

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.240
you die sick there was a family that had

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.890
that there's like a disease that you

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:47.040
couldn't sleep a whole family got it God

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.870
and they died well they all get it I

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.980
don't know it's a meth problem

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.650
what is this who's in like Italy they're

00:44:55.650 --> 00:45:00.240
doing [ __ ] asleep no asleep only

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.950
three hot rails and now I can't see I

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:03.240
was thinking about Italy a lot this week

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:06.600
because of Trump dog you know everyone's

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.070
talking about World War three which is

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:10.590
not gonna happen but their boss Ofuro

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:11.430
sue Iran

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:14.490
yeah that's not World War three it's

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:18.900
Iraq three yeah saying it's gonna kick

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.460
off but I was like this must have been

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:22.980
kind of how like the Italians Fett felt

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.170
like going into World War two just like

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.550
oh [ __ ] this is our leader

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:29.160
oh yeah it's like I voted for him cuz he

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.130
was like funny and gave funny speeches

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:34.110
[ __ ] this is our fearless leader that we

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:36.540
gotta follow that would be that would be

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:40.140
a from fur laughing so much about it if

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.060
he leaves our nation to like a really

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:45.450
horrific war that would be like oh I was

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.400
just it was funny he got [ __ ] on he

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.660
was on the apprentice and we were

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.890
laughing because you guys are crying and

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:51.540
stuff I didn't think you yeah that would

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.420
be a tough what did Iran do what's the

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.340
problem what happened well so maybe he

00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:01.080
was like he was a bad guy okay he was a

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.000
very bad guy yeah I was just reading an

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.300
article about it because it was like the

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.480
question is is like in this article it

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.250
said you know this isn't but it was like

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:13.890
did do you treat Iran as a country or as

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:17.310
a cause is it a terrorism like is it a

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.290
cause or is it a country that you need

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:22.589
to respect and the last co-presence

00:46:22.589 --> 00:46:25.319
treated it like a country but soul mania

00:46:25.319 --> 00:46:29.249
was like he really he's also destain

00:46:29.249 --> 00:46:30.599
it's funny for us to be like he's

00:46:30.599 --> 00:46:32.729
destabilizing the region because you

00:46:32.729 --> 00:46:34.769
know we are sure like wild we're getting

00:46:34.769 --> 00:46:38.160
in there but I mean there he like you

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.690
know he killed thousands of US troops

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:42.869
through like he would set up militias in

00:46:42.869 --> 00:46:45.779
Iraq and see I mean he saved Assad he

00:46:45.779 --> 00:46:48.660
like helped prop up Assad yeah who just

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.130
said you know he's gassing civilians

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:52.289
like I mean this guy's a bad dude yeah

00:46:52.289 --> 00:46:54.269
yeah so he's a player on the world stage

00:46:54.269 --> 00:46:58.680
yeah yeah it's a it's I mean it's wild

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.950
that we did that but he like yeah so

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:03.150
it's like do you treat Iran like a

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:04.469
country or do you treat them like a

00:47:04.469 --> 00:47:06.420
terrorist organization if they're gonna

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:08.849
be doing what they're doing like setting

00:47:08.849 --> 00:47:10.799
up roadside bombs to kill us in another

00:47:10.799 --> 00:47:11.400
country

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.660
yeah well that's always a funny thing

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.279
till when they do the terror rebel

00:47:14.279 --> 00:47:15.900
distinct terrorist rebel distinction

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:16.920
they're like oh look at these rebels

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.940
they're going in there and then it's

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.609
like give me the guys new years the guys

00:47:20.609 --> 00:47:22.680
blowing up [ __ ] too is like yeah they

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.150
always spin that around but again it's

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:26.579
like [ __ ] man what did the hell are you

00:47:26.579 --> 00:47:31.200
gonna do yeah so that we you know Trump

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.059
drone strike to that guy got rid of him

00:47:33.059 --> 00:47:35.579
he drone strike like a [ __ ] general

00:47:35.579 --> 00:47:37.950
yeah he was up there I suppose just

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:40.849
drone strike like civilian weddings

00:47:40.849 --> 00:47:47.549
drones it Jones actually have a sensor

00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:48.900
on them that when they hear this song

see how transparent the media is when it

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:51.890
comes to presenting [ __ ] like this

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:52.880

don't know man that [ __ ] is just weird

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:07.160
to me what's that well when people come

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.710
after like comedians comedians it's like

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:12.349
I mean let it let trace the line to the

00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:14.059
dude who's listening to the cast and

00:56:14.059 --> 00:56:15.529
then [ __ ] does it go it off and do it

00:56:15.529 --> 00:56:17.210
[ __ ] like that and dude I'll be like all

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:19.640
right my bad dude yeah it's like it just

00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.640
it's a weird thing to go after because

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.230
if they were to be like again just

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:25.579
present the narrative as it is but you

00:56:25.579 --> 00:56:26.930
have these crazy white dudes going on

00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:28.910
these crazy black dudes doing wild [ __ ]

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:30.470
and be like we gotta stop people doing

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:32.210
wild [ __ ] but instead they codify it

00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:33.650
with race and it's like white

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:35.329
nationalists do this and like crazy

00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:37.130
black teams like these we said it before

00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:38.809
just [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah you have a

00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:39.890
[ __ ] Pryor you have a [ __ ] and

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:42.440
if you have a very intense [ __ ]

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.240
probably the universal idiot and

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.200
[ __ ] problem yeah

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.000
and instead it just gets [ __ ] shined

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.680
in it like not silly obviously not these

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.200
are [ __ ] and [ __ ] but it's like

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.339
everyone tries to codify everything with

00:56:52.339 --> 00:56:53.839
race like this is a problem and you know

00:56:53.839 --> 00:56:56.150
yes I mean it's like dude anyone from

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:57.829
any of those groups would be like Jesus

00:56:57.829 --> 00:57:00.289
[ __ ] Christ yeah but instead ever gets

00:57:00.289 --> 00:57:01.339
pitted against each other it's like

00:57:01.339 --> 00:57:02.270
we're out with that bro

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:04.220

he's like dude it's gotta be him yeah

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.620
that's a distinct look talking about

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.240
some [ __ ] hurry everybody talk about

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.490
the gear let's take you to the page

00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:54.820
we're at 57 anyway crash-landing do this

00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:58.550
yeah again here's one here's one that I

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:00.350
was singing of cuz it's like even let's

00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:04.700
say you traced back violence to a comedy

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:07.490
podcast sure it's like do you think you

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:11.120
could trace gang violence to rap and

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:14.090
would you pursue that yeah that's

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:15.980
probably not nobody wants to talk about

00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:17.450
it's like dude if there was let's say

00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:19.100
let's say there's a you know a drive-by

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:22.010
shooting while they were blasting rap in

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:23.750
the car yeah it's like dude imagine if

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:24.590
there was a shooting while they were

00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:29.770
blasting secret pockets like hate group

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:32.420
sure it's like meanwhile have you black

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.340
you know so there's some weird some

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:36.170
little kids running around he just grabs

00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:37.910
two pieces of hairs like in we're back

00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:41.420
he's like crap yeah it is strange that's

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:42.680
one people don't want to touch it all

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:44.540
the rap thing is like is people big well

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:46.460
there's heavy metal it's like dude I

00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:47.900
wouldn't abide by the coach and heavy

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:48.950
metal either that [ __ ] freaks me the

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:51.910
[ __ ] yeah and when I think in like

00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:54.020
Scandinavia they started like burning

00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:56.030
churches because of black metal they

00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:57.290
would like listen to like death know

00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:59.990
they like started banning that like they

00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:01.730
were like all right let's cut that [ __ ]

00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:01.940
out

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:05.420
yeah dude once again but like for some

00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:09.620
reason rap is just like no it's no it's

00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.240
there's so many forms of it but don't

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.010
course there are forms that are like

00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:16.190
pure yeah Satan demonic [ __ ] like doing

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:17.360
it's like if you think about it from the

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.190
time your little the time you're older

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:20.990
you're hearing this like just kind of

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:23.740
like basically like a war drum dude is

00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:25.760
just like shoot kill shoot to kill shoot

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.800
kill percocets cereal percocets hero

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.380
killed yeah that has to have a [ __ ]

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:33.170
affected that has got to have an if it's

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:36.110
had an effect on me yeah let's do enough

00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:38.060
rap I'm like if somebody disrespects me

00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:40.490
today I'm gonna [ __ ] down literally like

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:41.839
I used to always listen to rap

00:59:41.839 --> 00:59:42.739
worked out that was like my favorite

00:59:42.739 --> 00:59:44.989
thing yeah working out and then if I

00:59:44.989 --> 00:59:47.749
drove by myself I listen to rap you like

00:59:47.749 --> 00:59:50.869
[ __ ] man yeah anymore like dude I'm

00:59:50.869 --> 00:59:52.969
Tony I think you made fun of me the one

00:59:52.969 --> 00:59:53.900
time I don't know what's happening

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:54.859
you're like you're just becoming an old

00:59:54.859 --> 00:59:55.729
[ __ ] white dude that's what's

00:59:55.729 --> 00:59:57.829
happening true but I like I mean this is

00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:59.479
a very old white guy argument where it's

00:59:59.479 --> 01:00:01.009
like well what about the hip-hop cause

01:00:01.009 --> 01:00:03.979
and violence but I mean it's again sure

01:00:03.979 --> 01:00:06.019
it could be silly we always have to

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:07.279
hedge your bets when you make [ __ ]

01:00:07.279 --> 01:00:09.710
old white guy comments or sure we're

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:11.299
sure but it's also you have to be like

01:00:11.299 --> 01:00:13.519
hey we are aware like they sound like

01:00:13.519 --> 01:00:15.109
curmudgeons hundred percent sound like

01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:16.819
I'm gonna cry during a wonderful life

01:00:16.819 --> 01:00:18.799
100% but then again if there's then

01:00:18.799 --> 01:00:20.119
there's a whole argument of like bullet

01:00:20.119 --> 01:00:21.739
you know this is all I had growing up it

01:00:21.739 --> 01:00:23.799
was like that gave me inspired me

01:00:23.799 --> 01:00:25.309
totally get that

01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:27.259
yeah but goddamn it dude some of the

01:00:27.259 --> 01:00:28.579
[ __ ] I listen to I'm like well that's

01:00:28.579 --> 01:00:31.579
just negative that's very negative one

01:00:31.579 --> 01:00:32.809
and it's also it's like we're not

01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:34.009
talking about that we're talking about

01:00:34.009 --> 01:00:37.130
the media's approach to it where it's

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:42.890
like if if a different genre of music

01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:45.829
was instilling violence they would

01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:48.019
destroy it immediately dude if I picked

01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:49.519
up the acoustic and started like just

01:00:49.519 --> 01:00:51.130
singing it was like I will shoot a

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:52.779
[ __ ]

01:00:52.779 --> 01:00:56.180
you'll fake dude leave and maybe they

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.099
have that though well Johnny Cash like I

01:00:58.099 --> 01:01:00.650
shot him down true well that was that

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:02.690
was torn that was when bums were really

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:04.279
there was like a big bum culture if you

01:01:04.279 --> 01:01:06.200
read the book Jack Black that's like the

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.969
Grateful Dead like they were always like

01:01:07.969 --> 01:01:10.729
glorifying like hop on a train just walk

01:01:10.729 --> 01:01:12.289
around it was yeah dudes like on trains

01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:13.819
like pissing on hay and stabbing each

01:01:13.819 --> 01:01:16.519
other it was shitty sucked but they like

01:01:16.519 --> 01:01:18.759
glorified that like being like a like a

01:01:18.759 --> 01:01:21.499
Kerouac like a wandering petty man I

01:01:21.499 --> 01:01:23.690
could do that yeah it's like sucks no I

01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:25.519
tried I listened I listened to I used to

01:01:25.519 --> 01:01:27.259
read Bukowski and I was like yeah dude I

01:01:27.259 --> 01:01:29.029
could do that oh dude that's like I got

01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:33.589
drunk like three times anyone can fall

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:35.269
prey to it but there has to be a point

01:01:35.269 --> 01:01:36.799
where like nah dude that kind of sucks

01:01:36.799 --> 01:01:39.680
yeah it sucks being being a drug lord in

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.900
the project sucks tears don't aspire to

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.180
that being a [ __ ] hobo on a train

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.700
sucks dude that's not a good goal yeah

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.099
people are getting hit with fake goals

01:01:48.099 --> 01:01:51.049
that's why I'm saying dude legalize all

01:01:51.049 --> 01:01:52.910
drugs cut out the drug market totally

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.559
you will cut out so much [ __ ]

01:01:54.559 --> 01:01:55.579
[ __ ]

01:01:55.579 --> 01:01:56.509
because if you're trapped in an

01:01:56.509 --> 01:01:58.549
environment we're like literally dude if

01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:59.630
you're gonna pour there's certain parts

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:01.099
of Philly where you're in a neighborhood

01:02:01.099 --> 01:02:03.499
we're like a lot of people you know it's

01:02:03.499 --> 01:02:04.940
like every one of your fit not everyone

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:06.229
in your family but like there's so many

01:02:06.229 --> 01:02:07.819
people around you that like legitimately

01:02:07.819 --> 01:02:10.339
now they can't come up but like the idea

01:02:10.339 --> 01:02:11.900
of getting a job is like yo you gotta

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.160
that's like you got a job it's like how

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.119
the [ __ ] did you do that

01:02:14.119 --> 01:02:15.739
yeah and then you just put [ __ ]

01:02:15.739 --> 01:02:17.269
making three four hundred dollars a day

01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:18.559
selling drugs it's like I'm taking

01:02:18.559 --> 01:02:20.329
selling drugs all day if you eliminate

01:02:20.329 --> 01:02:22.039
the drug dealin part of it is even a

01:02:22.039 --> 01:02:24.380
possibility all that [ __ ] life force

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.359
it will go it'll it'll Ricci can other

01:02:26.359 --> 01:02:28.130
levels I'm going but dude it's like you

01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:31.400
put the drug market all the like nobody

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.959
can get a job or you know it's just like

01:02:32.959 --> 01:02:35.239
people just so totally blown out from

01:02:35.239 --> 01:02:37.130
generational just [ __ ] that's happened

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:39.709
and then there's no jobs all the

01:02:39.709 --> 01:02:41.900
criminal stuff and it's like it's

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.309

01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:45.079

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.509

01:03:11.509 --> 01:03:13.489
the time come two days I'll be in my car

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:14.989
listening to rap man yeah oh I like it

01:03:14.989 --> 01:03:15.349
again

01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:17.269
yes but I'm telling you more and more I

01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:19.059
just [ __ ] I think you'd like Jay Cole

01:03:19.059 --> 01:03:21.499
he's alright that's something that was

01:03:21.499 --> 01:03:21.890
funny

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:24.949
I only like the most like true fucked-up

01:03:24.949 --> 01:03:28.690
horrible rap rap I like which is totally

01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:32.630
I like [ __ ] up movies about not

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:35.269
killing people my [ __ ]

01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:37.489
of course so again I'm not saying I'm

01:03:37.489 --> 01:03:39.890
perfect yeah I've killed a man back in

01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:44.180
86 in 86 how's this born yeah I don't

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:45.680
know man the rap thinks of the night cuz

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.999
again there's no way to talk about it

01:03:46.999 --> 01:03:49.160
because it's like I'm listening to I'm

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.979
like this has to be bad for people yeah

01:03:51.979 --> 01:03:53.869
this has to be [ __ ] warping people's

01:03:53.869 --> 01:03:56.390
perceptions being like there's this

01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:58.039
thing where it's like if you get to get

01:03:58.039 --> 01:03:59.900
to the top here's the behavior here's

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.150
the behaviors to engage in and you will

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:04.099
get to the top and be the past and it's

01:04:04.099 --> 01:04:07.219
like no no no don't don't do any of that

01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:08.690
it's just horrible yeah

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:11.030
like it's like the movie Scarface yeah

01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:13.040
that's what you gotta be like you want

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.869
that cool house you gotta be like him

01:04:14.869 --> 01:04:17.089
yeah it's like no don't do that well

01:04:17.089 --> 01:04:18.829
that's what nobody want again I did if I

01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:21.020
grew up in a just a bomb down in vibe

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.000
like I totally I get that but when

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.619
nobody wants to talk about the only way

01:04:24.619 --> 01:04:27.020
out of that is like one or two

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.510
generations of just mind-numbing boring

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:32.390
low-paid labor it's horrible it's a

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:34.369
horrible thing to think about that's the

01:04:34.369 --> 01:04:37.280
only way to get from the very very but

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.510
of course people there's be you know

01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:40.790
exceptions to the rule but also to there

01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:42.349
also could just be like everything about

01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:44.329
it that might just be not enough jobs

01:04:44.329 --> 01:04:47.000
sure I get it there's imagine if all the

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.130
jobs are taken and you're just like no

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:50.119
I'm telling you guys I'm trying to get

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:52.250
one go come on man yeah like no I'm

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:53.720
telling you they're just there no jobs

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:57.050
let's go stop listening to rap so it's

01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:58.579
fickle like I never try to come across

01:04:58.579 --> 01:05:00.109
as a total authority but it's like

01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:01.520
that's annoying thing - you can't just

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.079
explore something any more people like

01:05:03.079 --> 01:05:04.790
did you hear that therefore and it's

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:07.400
like bro I know if you think you even

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.530
got to the [ __ ] even you this is no

01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:11.630
this is one wrinkle of the infinity of

01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:13.670
my mind dude don't ever try to reduce me

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:16.430
to some [ __ ] [ __ ] dude here I'm

01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:19.460
saying yeah yeah that's entirely you're

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.550
gonna have anxiety after this podcast

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.480
yeah I think I'll be all right after

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:27.319
this one yeah I it's just I think the

01:05:27.319 --> 01:05:29.150
point of it is it's like a weird it's

01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:32.030
it's just when it's so transparent when

01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:33.890
the media is doing this when it comes to

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:35.720
like again like with the Jewish people

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.980
getting beat up by black people right

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.960
now yeah to be fair they went the news

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.880
went pretty ham on black people in the

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.900
early 90s for about 15 years

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:46.640
being like a South West Philly another

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.819
black guy no [ __ ] up don't get me

01:05:49.819 --> 01:05:51.410
wrong the news went hey I think they're

01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:53.060
given a break when the pendulum keeps

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.579
swinging sure it's like let's try to try

01:05:55.579 --> 01:05:57.410
your best to keep it in the middle just

01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:58.760
say what happened here's what happened

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:02.240
yeah you know but again you know why

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.349
would you do that you know in charge the

01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:05.690
news yeah people own the news so it's

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:08.180
like what you gotta do yeah and it like

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:10.099
yeah when it's so clearly clicked driven

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:13.069
yeah it's like more the rise of

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:16.690
neo-nazis in New York so I these are not

01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:20.600
neo-nazis black dudes

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.550
like why are we do they presented as

01:06:22.550 --> 01:06:24.410
neo-nazis yeah there's been articles of

01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:27.070
that yes they could be they could be

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:42.010
neo-nazis the kid B dude could be I

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:44.240
think that would be a good look for the

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.770
Nazis if they switch to a more neo

01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:48.680
approach just like better dancing more

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.550
sex appeal

01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:52.340
you know neo wrote a lot of hits yeah he

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:53.930
wrote uh you should let me love you bye

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:57.320
Mary oh wow you know what's funny thing

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:00.170

01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:03.380

being as far left as possible but then

01:10:29.159 --> 01:10:31.260
the entire time that involves

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.570
appropriating black culture oh for sure

01:10:33.570 --> 01:10:36.000

like random white chicks are like gasps

01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:52.350
girl oh my god and I'll get

01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:55.110
uncomfortable for them yeah yeah yeah

01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:56.760
cuz it's funny cuz I've noticed you'll

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.700
just be like okay alright like the [ __ ]

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:01.680
yeah weird and they'll be the first to

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.720
be like a white person with dreadlocks

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.450
is evil that's not your hair and it's

01:11:06.450 --> 01:11:08.970
like well you've adopted their entire

01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:12.900
personality yeah and you use it comedic

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.240
Lee it's not like they use that it's

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.790
like an ironic way of using black

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:20.190
terminology yeah you know I mean sure

01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:21.510
yes [ __ ]

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:24.150
and so yeah you're you're not using that

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:26.160
genuine that's like all like 23 year old

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.960
white chicks yeah it's just that's like

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.850
the mode that seems like yeah it's you

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:31.140
know it's because the Internet's like

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:32.370
Twitter and all that [ __ ] it's like but

01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:34.650
it's like that's how we talk now yeah

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:36.890
but if someone ironically just

01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:39.750
culturally appropriating people yeah

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:41.790
ironically and then being the moral

01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:44.550
compass for everybody else it's odd it

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:45.900
is odd but it's also you're dealing

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:47.010
people who aren't scratching the surface

01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:48.840
really yeah they're just reacting

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:51.150
