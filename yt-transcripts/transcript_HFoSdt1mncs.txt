00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.399
anxiety throughout the day of like is it

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.039

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.600
time ago trying to write like jokes yeah

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.559
you know

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.239
yeah like if i try to write something

funny on there i i don't do that anymore

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.799
yeah exactly but even just just like

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.200
interacting on facebook is it's a weird

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.960
it's weird as [ __ ] here's a psychotic

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.720
thing i did the other night i was on

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.119
instagram and i i

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.920
see people that i follow

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.280
and then you can click who they're

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.840
following and see if they follow you

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.759
i was like oh what the [ __ ] seeing who

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.360
didn't follow you yeah who i've been

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.640
following and i was like [ __ ] them

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.640
unfollow they suck

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.920
that's what i'm talking about yeah yeah

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.720
yeah that i i really like as i was when

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.159
that all first came out i'm like this is

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.840
great people can all talk and like share

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.880
their thoughts and i'm like yeah we

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.920
should probably keep them to ourselves i

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.119
think

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.640
we shouldn't have our thoughts just

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.200
intermingling in like a public space 24

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.920
7. god no and there should be like a as

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.399
we record a podcast of our thoughts yeah

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.479
it's true that's true but it's different

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.479
than being sitting there and being like

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.079
this is what you're just writing it out

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.000
and it's like boom now like a thousand

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.600
people see it is there anything worse

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.920
than writing a like spur of the moment

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.840
thing you thought was funny yeah and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.000
getting like three likes

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.759
i checked when i when i will do five

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.200
minutes without a like i'm deleting i

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.799
delete it right away i do i pretty much

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.759
delete now if i put a facebook status up

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.160
its rate of survival is like 10 yeah

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.840
that i get four minutes into it i get

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.599
this weird feeling i go [ __ ] this and i

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.520
delete it the poster i

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.599
i put up is that like

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.040
it's at like 20 likes you want to delete

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.280
it 40 minutes 20 likes in 40 minutes is

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.800
not good

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.920
whatever it's funny too though that like

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.680
the number of likes it's getting is

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.280
enacting the part of your body that's

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.800
like a tiger's in your basement you're

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.640
like oh [ __ ] oh man something's going

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.360
bad this is horrible it's uh

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.440
but i think this is a bad time to post

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.879
it why like before noon during the week

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.879
everyone's at work true i mean the whole

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.239
point of it is it's a bad time yeah but

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.680
the whole point is to put it out for

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.760
people who are going to see it yeah yeah

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.920
that is so funny um

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.680
but yeah this is our sorry we're a

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.000
little late on this we we uh we were we

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.400
tried to record one yesterday yeah we

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.560
ended up just rambling about some

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.280
[ __ ] local comedy dumb [ __ ] this

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.440
[ __ ] we shouldn't have there's a

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.680
couple of [ __ ] white don lemons dude

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.920
i'll tell you what the problem is

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.200
we're going to hopefully avoid that on

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.640
this one but yeah

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.920
i don't want to talk

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.920
i was thinking about that today or last

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.560
night how it is funny to think that like

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.159
there's a bunch of philadelphia comedy

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.720
podcasts who just kind of like volley at

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.400
each other through their podcast that

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.080
only they listen to and it's like i'll

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.440
tell you [ __ ] what about you right

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.239
now

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.879
i know i'm not going to mention them but

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:31.680
they

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.120
like the 20 of people who let's do it

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.480
like okay i know exactly what you're

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.120
talking about

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.680
it is funny to think about how big of a

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.760
deal it is and like you know the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.680
nasdaq's ticking on as usual there's

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.239
people like oh my god

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.840
you find out you can't go to like a bar

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.599
for six months you're like oh [ __ ] this

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.519
[ __ ] just hit the fan

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.920
it's like yeah not really yeah it's just

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.480
uh it's pointless yeah it doesn't matter

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.799
and yeah there are things that i thought

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.239
you know like anything it's like you

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.680
think it's a big deal

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.280
and then a [ __ ] day goes by and

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.120
you're like oh yeah who cares exactly or

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.879
you look down from the heights that you

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.280
[ __ ] occupy and you're like

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.799
everything looks like just like ants and

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.239
stuff and you're like what's going on

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.680
what are these ants fighting let's just

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.600
scramble down here like interesting i

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.320
should step on both of them

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.720
or i'll spare them yeah

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.840

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.880
my great aunt lives with my parents yeah

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.680
i think you've mentioned this and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.000

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.400
right yeah old irish lady yeah my mom

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.840
moved her out of her place and like

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.919

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.199
like here's all of your stuff and the

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.680

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.120
the bank the lady my great aunt what

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.120
took all her money out of the bank or

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.720
like a big deposit or whatever i think

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.000
she probably has way more she's been

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.919
working since she was like 10 and she

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.680
was born like 1910

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.160
but she took 800 bucks out of the bank

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.080
and just squirreled it and then she lost

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.199
it so she doesn't know where it is so

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.880
there's 800 bucks floating around in my

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.000

and the cast the entire cast they opened

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.959
this season with a play like hamilton

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.519
style about slavery okay and the black

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:50.000
experience in america is how they open

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.240
this show on abc is like a comedy kind

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.839
of like a sitcom it's supposed to be a

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:55.360
sitcom but it's serious like okay they

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.839
have episodes where it's like

00:09:57.839 --> 00:09:59.040
they have episodes where they need to

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.480
sit down and talk to their kids about

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.000
the police yeah

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.920
killing all of their people yeah and

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.480
like it just [ __ ] like

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.920
i don't know how was the thing what was

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.920
the thing like well it was again it was

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.240
like hamilton so it was like rap

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.959
historical rap nice and this one opened

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:17.200
with like anthony anderson

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.440
like sweeping in a slave quarters and

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.959
he's like i'm tired now

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:26.880
really crazy oh and like

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.399
they were like

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:30.240
like well and the little kids were like

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.240
what did we build and he was like the

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.800
railroads and wall street

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.600
white house and chapel hill it's just

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.760
like damn dude you guys are claiming all

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.839
that that's a [ __ ] tough claim

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:43.839
slaves built the railroads

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:46.720
they helped for sure yeah so i you know

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.200
i'm a [ __ ] racist so i was like okay

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.079
i gotta

00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:51.760
i'm gonna fact check this a little bit

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.120
to be like what

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.880
did slaves really so that's what you're

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.399
doing reading it at 3am reading about

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:57.680
the idea well i was like i think it'd be

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.200
funny to make a parody of that with the

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.959
irish and do the exact same thing in

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:03.360
like a [ __ ] shitty quarters like yeah

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.519
what else did we build

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:07.040
like well pretty much everything on the

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.560
east coast actually

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.000
like

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.760
i don't know anthony anderson comes out

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.839
i was like no you didn't and then he

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:15.760
ends the funniest as he ends the one

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.959
scene with like

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:19.040
he rips his vest off

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.560
and underneath it he's wearing a shirt

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.040
that's like i am my ancestors wildest

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.200
dreams and he does that thing where like

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.640
everybody's frozen because it's the end

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.880
of a scene in a musical he like stands

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.640
there with his shirt and he's like

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.320
breathing hard staring into the light

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.000
like

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.560
it just says i am my ancestors wildest

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.680
dreams

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.600
it was just [ __ ] like do you think do

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.040
you think black people deal with like

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.040
extreme low self-esteem because of

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.440
slavery

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.600
maybe you know they're like in the

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.440
history it's like yeah and you guys got

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.680
captured and kind of were bitched for

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.920
like 200 years but again and then like

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.200
200 years later you're just like what

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.519
the [ __ ] and this is and this is the

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.120
worst part because

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.120
every racist is always like

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.800
yeah well what about the irish or

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.240
whatever you are like let's say you're

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.760
italian they're like people were mean to

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.720
us too yeah it's like really not as mean

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.480
yeah

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.360
but still yeah it's correct

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.920
yeah who was so who was it i know it is

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.560
correct to say that

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.120
people in ireland

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.120
the british committed a genocide

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.279
basically yeah against the irish

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:27.440
basically throughout history

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.600
and then they came to america

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.320
suffered from poverty and disease and

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.800
had to immediately join the [ __ ]

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.440
civil war like all this [ __ ] yeah and

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.040
it's like

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.200
just because your history

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.000
wasn't as bad as theirs

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.440
you're not allowed to [ __ ] be like

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.200
well yeah i mean

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.399
yeah it's like you guys built the

00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:49.600
railroad

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.519
i thought that was uh you know we were

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:52.399
there

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:54.800
yeah but we're not allowed to be like

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.000
we helped

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.399
yeah it's a weird thing it it is weird

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:00.160
it is weird too to be like

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.480
the big slaves built this entire country

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.600
it's like

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.200
oh yeah that'd be like if 100 years from

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.040
now i mean this might be a bad parallel

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.480
that would be like 100 years from now to

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.240
be like union laborers to be like we

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.880
built this country it's like yes

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.440
now you guys didn't really per se

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.360
you know what i mean it's like yeah i

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.720
mean it's it sucks as you're getting

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.240
paid that's a big difference if you're

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.839
if you're enslaved into building a bunch

00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:23.519
of stuff if you're getting three dollars

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:24.959
an hour and you live in a

00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:28.160
and you owe the factory four every day

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.279
you're a [ __ ] slave yeah that's true

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:32.880
it's just a weird that is a weird thing

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.800
to where it's like

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.040
all right yeah man i mean it's weird to

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.200
think that like now everyone has to kind

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.800
of sit here and be like

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.079
kind of tap their fingers on their

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:44.320
thighs like yeah yeah you know they're

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.519
slaves

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:47.360
like uh i don't know what to do about it

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.440
but uh yeah it's like you know how we

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.440
were there and you guys were there

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.079
yeah [ __ ] build [ __ ] yeah anthony

00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:55.839
anderson you're a [ __ ] actor yeah

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:57.839
he's like five millionaires on stage

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:00.000
being like i'm a slave it's like no

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.639
you're not yeah shut the [ __ ] up there's

00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:04.079
something [ __ ]

00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:06.959
i definitely understand why people like

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:08.480
it

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.560
and it is obviously important to talk

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.440
about history yeah but there's something

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.000
[ __ ] bad about it well you're saying

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.160
something abc is profiting off god

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.680
they're crushing it dude and like

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.720
they're like you know how we should

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.800
start this season of our sitcom how

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.120
about a slave musical

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.880
did it have anything to do with it has

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.880
nothing to do with the show at all

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.480
yeah i mean dude although i guess the

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.760
show is about

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.000
the black experience yeah i mean it's

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
just that's hot right now dude yeah be

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.320
like racial yeah racial injustice and if

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.480
you can really crank up like the [ __ ]

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.079
racial guilt dude

00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:45.839
your show is crushing it but like

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:46.959
yeah and then

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:48.399
so like i

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:50.000
was like i said i was being a psycho

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.560
last night like looking up

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.920
so a lot of the times there's not a lot

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.199
of records of it because they were like

00:14:57.199 --> 00:14:59.680
no one was keeping track of [ __ ]

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.199
slave labor yeah um so like for the the

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:06.880
capital for example in the united states

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.120
they didn't really build it

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.600
but they did clear out like the trees

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.760
and rocks that were on the ground where

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.000
it was built okay and people like slaves

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.920
built the capitol

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.360
so yeah they landed their hands no they

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.279
didn't they landed their hands right i

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:22.880
don't know it's just like that that is

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.959
kind of weird like the white house i

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:27.839
looked at that it's like

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
the every historical article about it's

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.360
like slaves

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.600
almost definitely helped

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.120
yeah there's not really that much of a

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.839
record about it but they probably helped

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:39.199
well yeah and it's interesting to think

00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:40.880
that they'd be up there like pointing

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.199
bricks and [ __ ] you know it's like they

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:44.800
came off the plantation and like they're

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.600
just brick like brick masons

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.040
like you know what let these guys handle

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.160
it yeah

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.240
yeah let them rock the people that we

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.079
don't think are human let them build our

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.800
[ __ ] president's house yeah i just i

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.160
don't believe that yeah and then in the

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.600
same song they're like we raised the

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.800
children and it's like

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.360
did you oh like nannying and stuff it's

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.440
like did you raise my [ __ ] is this

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.279
about family's children is this more so

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:11.920
about the like aristocratic south or

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.759
like the whole country

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:14.959
they made it sound like it was the whole

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:16.160
country i mean they were talking about

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.800
the white house and things like that so

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.720
it was you know they were talking oh

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.920
yeah and this was another one that was

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.320
good it was like wall street we built

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.040
that so wall street like the building

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.480
and then it's like

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.000
oh so wait they're saying they built

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
like all the banks and all that like

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.759
wall street like they built the stock

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.920
like all this and yeah turns out they

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.880
built

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.880
the literal wall

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.720
they helped build the wall that wall

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.279
street's named after okay so not

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:44.560
anything to do with the buildings and

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.120
[ __ ] the original wall in like the dutch

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.560
settlement in like the 17th century

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.680
because that's what it's named for they

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.160
built a wall to like keep out indians

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.160
so they helped build like the trump they

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.000
built the original trump trump wall in

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.399
manhattan they piled a bunch of rocks to

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.540
keep out the savages

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.279
[Music]

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:05.280
it is funny whenever you kind of like

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.439
look below the veneers like hollywood

00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:09.600
puts up it's never nice it's always kind

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.120
of me it's like what happened in [ __ ]

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.319
uh

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.520
when i looked up uh hidden figures yeah

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.799
like i was like there's something about

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:18.880
this that seems weird about nasa well

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.319
yeah now you're equipped with this

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:21.760
knowledge that you're like and now i'm a

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.360
[ __ ] psycho where i got to go out and

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.959
be like hey you know uh in hidden

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:27.120
figures when the like the major plot

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.480
line is that there's a coloreds only

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.880
bathroom white's only bathroom at nasa

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.640
yeah and kevin costner breaks it down

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.559
with a sledgehammer he's like 16. we're

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:36.720
all scientists here

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.400
it's like yeah that didn't happen

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.679
they never left the building to go to

00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:41.760
the bathroom yeah man that's wild it's

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.039
just weird

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:44.960
yeah i mean it just dramatic you know

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.400
makes like it is it's interesting to

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.760
take history it's like one thing to take

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.080
a story and you know dramatize it but to

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.000
take history and be like we're going to

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.520
tinker a little bit it's like that is

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.559
kind of weird

00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:55.600
and then you got to sit there and be

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.679
like wow slaves raised our kids and

00:17:57.679 --> 00:17:59.280
built the entire country

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.200
hmm yeah i didn't know that we should be

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.080
better

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.760
like yeah but that probably comes from

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.280
like

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.320
i mean

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.840
i guess it's no i guess it's not shitty

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.919
to say like if you have a job

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:11.280
any job

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.160
the employees are always being like i do

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.080
all the work here it's like there's

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.480
probably a lot more to you know

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.320
and it's it's unjustifiable you don't be

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.440
like you know what actually besides

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.360
having slaves it was probably difficult

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.640
to have a planet but people are not

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.320
trying to hear that yeah

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.000
balance the [ __ ] books you know it's

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.840
just like yeah no nobody wants to be

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.000
like well yeah it is stressful you know

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.120
having sleep

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.120
half the workers that you were with were

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.480
also

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.840
like

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.200
right next to you and you're like we

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.559
built this and they're like yeah we

00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:42.320
helped and they're like no you didn't

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.240
yeah doing the exact same [ __ ] job as

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.160
you yeah but that and that's the thing

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.520
it's like they're like we didn't get

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.039
paid like what about the chinese and the

00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:51.600
irish on the railroad there yeah

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.520
you know yeah but it's like i don't know

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.120
yeah they got paid i mean they can't

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.640
include that in the song they're like we

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.799
built it also the chinese and the irish

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:02.000
helped us but they got paid yeah

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.679
yeah it takes away from the dramatic

00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:05.200
thing yeah there was a line in it also

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.880
that was like one of the when they were

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.640
listing [ __ ] they built the one kid was

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.360
like the pyramids and this grandma was

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.480
like

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.360
no that was our hebrew brothers

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.120
really yeah yeah

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.520
i think it was written by a jew dude

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.679
like a jew who was like

00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:22.960
we are slaves

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.049
[Music]

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.520
holy [ __ ]

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.039
yeah it was uh

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:30.240
that's funny

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.000
so that was that was frustrating to

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.039
watch yeah it's just that you know

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.720
this is just the you know this is just a

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.559

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.919
charged guys are very sexual

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.440

yeah he used like a [ __ ] hunger

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.480

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.400
amazing he deserves it and what did you

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.400
get what happened i think he was you

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.320

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.120
like he was sleeping with kids

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.880
hey he was [ __ ] hungry dude he was

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.799
deliberately like he i think he's the

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:59.919
way he put it this is i think yeah don't

00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:02.080
[ __ ] freak out listener about like

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.280

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.799
i think it was like he was sleeping with

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:06.960
a bunch of girls like young girls and

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.919
like his

00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:10.159
he was testing himself to not [ __ ] him

00:22:10.159 --> 00:22:11.760
or something like that something like

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.960
that

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.679
when how long ago was this so

00:22:15.679 --> 00:22:18.240
jesus gandhi

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.960
i think like

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.200
early 20th

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.679
late 19th century okay so this is a dude

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:27.360
in india who's trying to figure out a

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.520
way to test his will it's like yeah

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.880
young girls the hottest things around

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.400
you of course that's like the end-all

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.760
be-all to be like well if i don't [ __ ]

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.919
these young girls

00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:37.600
i don't know true

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.720
it's like what the [ __ ] out what was he

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.799
gonna do no no i know but i'm saying if

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.400
you exactly there's

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.320
there's parameters kelly's doing that

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.440
right now that's why he has them all in

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.320
his house but don't [ __ ] these girls

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.120
i mean

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.520
ignition yeah that's better than freeing

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.600
india true um

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.520
like anytime we look at history we

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.320
always put a modern context on and you

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.919
can't do that yeah

00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:00.960
you know especially in a whole other

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.720
[ __ ] space christopher columbus was a

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.320
huge piece of [ __ ] it's like yeah by

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.480
today's standards yeah by

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.880
portuguese and spanish standards in

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.520
1492. it was pretty [ __ ] amazing

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.760
pretty remarkable yeah yeah that's true

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.039
that is funny so [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah

00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:19.600
it's like dude i like kayaked

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.360
in the ocean and went like 50 feet from

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.720
the shoreline i was like i gotta get the

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.120
[ __ ] back again this is terrifying yeah

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.720
that was uh

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.400
some [ __ ] guy was talking about that

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.559
because in spain there they were having

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:32.080
a tough time dealing with the fact that

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.000
columbus was a sack of [ __ ]

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
because they've always liked him yeah

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.520
and uh

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.640
there's one guy i remember he was

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.679
talking to me about it and he was like

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:41.360
well what he did was absolutely [ __ ]

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.120
amazing so

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.799
he's like the fortitude and strength it

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:46.320
took to cross the atlantic ocean yeah

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.000
dude without the [ __ ]

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.679
[ __ ] boat i could be on a carnival

00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:51.360
cruise line and i'd be like this thing

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.760
could [ __ ] sink facing mutiny like

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.520
the whole time jesus christ yeah it was

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.000
but you know he found some found some

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.440
natives and was like these would be good

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.679

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.799
yeah that's uh

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:12.880
that is history dude it's funny too

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.320
because you're the king back then so it

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.760

theories yesterday yeah

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.679
it hit the mainstream which one so the

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:51.440
leader of blacks for bernies it's like a

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.000
group for bernie sanders he just sued

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.440
dnc

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.800
and made them

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.720
his lawsuit is trying to get them to

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.599
refund pledges for bernie supporters and

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.119
also give

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:05.760
hillary's private server to the public

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.040
because he thinks there's information

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.680
about seth rich and his murder in dc

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.040
within that thing it's like a real

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.880
lawsuit what was seth rich's murder in

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.880
dc he was he was like working for the

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.800
dnc in some capacity and like he just

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.240
got shot in the head randomly in

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.599
washington dc and they were all saying

00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:21.359
like they think he was a leaker

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:22.880
and julian assange was like he was one

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.040
of my leakers and wikileaks was like no

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.320
no no

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.960
and then like people they're like he got

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.000
shot in the back of the head and they

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.440
said it was a botched robbery but like

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.720
they didn't take his gold chain his

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.720
wallet or anything he had a gold chain

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.760
yeah

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.680
a little seth rich you're the gold chain

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.880
[ __ ] yeah that's what i was laughing

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.000
about

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.520
maybe the [ __ ] blacks for bernie just

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.200
assumed he had something [ __ ] sick

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.440
hanging from his neck yeah it was jesus

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.119
like we obviously had a big huge gold

00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:48.000
chain

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:48.960
yeah

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.160
no apparently yeah that's what they

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.440
found there they found like gold chain

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.119
on them everything all is wrong so this

00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:54.880
is gold pinky right this guy went

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.480
[ __ ] public with the black conspiracy

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.599
theory or really mccain who

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:01.520
[ __ ] seth his diamond cane was just

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.960
left on him

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.440
his pimp hat was trampled with a feather

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.359
in it

00:36:07.359 --> 00:36:09.040
but no for so this guy's like really

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.720
suing the dnc being like you got to give

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.599
all the people back money who donate it

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:14.960
i'm sure a black guy is suing a

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.119
government that'll yeah it'll take off

00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:19.040
he'll be successful it's just it's funny

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.400
now though that like

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.960
these can he's suing them with hopes of

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.480
enlightening a conspiracy theory which

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.680
is like they're gaining more traction

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.040
that's why you're seeing now like

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.079
there's studies coming out me like

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:29.599
people who go for conspiracy theories

00:36:29.599 --> 00:36:30.800
there's like something wrong you can

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.400
identify in their brains and it's like

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.079
which of course blows up conspiracy

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:35.520
boards because they're like now they're

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.400
trying to [ __ ] lobotomize us

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.160
[ __ ] wild dude black and swears these

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.000
theories are the best it it's there's

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.920
nothing they were the comment section of

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.160
that blackish video loaded with black

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.920
and spears of course it was wonderful

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.280
you know what they're all pissed at what

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.680
i bet you can get it

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.400
no the pyramids were saying that like

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.160
when the grandma was like we can't take

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.400
credit that was our hebrew brothers they

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.599
were all like

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:01.280
the [ __ ] mainstream media won't give

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.200
us credit for the [ __ ] pyramids they

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.119
can't stand the fact that black people

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:06.320
built that

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.079
it's like we were the hebrews the black

00:37:08.079 --> 00:37:09.839
people are hebrews we're the true lost

00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:12.079
tribe of [ __ ] that's [ __ ] sick

00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:13.760
yeah wait so they're how does the

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.440
hebrews work where they're like

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.520
they're 12 tribes and they're jews yeah

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.119
so this is all [ __ ] like the 12

00:37:19.119 --> 00:37:20.400
tribes i'm pretty sure is like an old

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.640
testament like yeah yeah 12 tribes

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.960
israel there's there's people who claim

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.720
that there was like a lost black drive

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.200
who was just slaves back in the year

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.800
i think there was a thing called the

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.200
lost tribe yeah yeah and black people

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.880
are like that was us we're the we're the

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.359
tribe they were black okay sure it's

00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:38.880
like all right and then they're like

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.480
we're the ones who were the slaves in

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.000
egypt

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.599
that's where the lost tribe was you

00:37:43.599 --> 00:37:45.440
could also be like yeah dude [ __ ]

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.520
hell yeah you guys did do all this [ __ ]

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.800
nice yeah

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.640
it's like now what yeah

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.400
what's going on what's up what's what's

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.400
the next step dude yeah dude what are

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.920
you guys working on another one how

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.760
about uh you guys working on another

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.359
pyramid yeah what the [ __ ] yo bill yeah

00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:00.640
build a [ __ ] pyramid that's

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.160
definitely i mean

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.760
it's just odd that is a funny way to do

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.960
it be like all right

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.200
[ __ ] yeah dude yeah like yeah i [ __ ]

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.680
stack the rocks you guys did that

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.599
that is funny yeah but then again if

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:12.640
someone was like all right build the

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.880
railroads to me i'd be like no

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.480
i can't do it i'd be like all right and

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.079
[ __ ] yeah you'd be out there build

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:20.160
some crooked railroad the car would

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.599
explode and die

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:23.839
only bruce willis would live true he'd

00:38:23.839 --> 00:38:26.240
be unbreakable as [ __ ]

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.240
you did it i love black conspiracy

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.359
theories dude

00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:31.760
yeah black conspiracy theories

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.040
i mean white conspiracy theories are

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.280
pretty good they go pretty hard on white

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.280
people are pretty intense i feel like

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.200
the white conspiracy theories get more

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.280
technical where the black conspiracy

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.040
theories are more grand and theoretical

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.400
which i tend to like because i'm too

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.839
lazy to do the research it's actually a

00:38:45.839 --> 00:38:47.520
fair

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.880
there's a pretty fair statement like

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.240
white conspiracy theorists are like and

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.920
then this angle i have this thing from

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.440
the vantage here and i put this video

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.640
into this and then if you look at the

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.160
time logs you see the flight pattern

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.839
it's like black conspiracy theorists

00:38:57.839 --> 00:39:00.400
like clearly this wild [ __ ] theory

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.760
that's more of my speed it's like

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.520
everybody knows the government gives us

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.320
aids

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.320
that's like so now with that fact as we

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.640
all know let's move forward that's more

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.119
my speed i like just i like wild

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:13.520
theories if you're gonna sit down and

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.000
you know as a hobby read conspiracies

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.920
yeah that's the one you want you want

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.400
the basic black version of like

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.400
soy makes everyone gay yeah that was the

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.839
last i already know that let's keep

00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:24.960
talking

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.960
what was that that was on a thing about

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.560
that was on uh

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.560
a thread because

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.839
last night you and me were discussing uh

00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:37.680
how it's just the paradox of a feminist

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.880
being like raps cool yeah yeah and then

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.440
uh how like black people are not black

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.880
people i mean

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.240
there's there tends to be a strong

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.000
amount of homophobia

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.320
in the black community yeah and then

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.160
even in rap yeah you could just boil

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.000
down a wrap yeah

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.480
and then uh we looked at uh

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.920
right when i got on facebook we took a

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.440
break and the first thing i saw was like

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.000
a political cartoon this one black comic

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.480
wrote or posted and he's a he's a black

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.480
conspiracy theorist all day that's sick

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.240
but he posted this political cartoon of

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.480
like a black fist crushing a rainbow

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.440
flag

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.480
and it was like

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.640
black people hating gays for being gay

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.400
is just as bad as white people hating

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.320
blacks for being black and he was like

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.240
i'm confused by this how the [ __ ] does

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.599
this make sense and then the first

00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:22.960
comment was this black chick that was

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.200
like uh it's bigotry

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.200
what what are you not getting about yeah

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.040
he was like i know one thing i didn't

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.800
choose to be black

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.560
it's like oh baby

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.880
and then like the next in a few comments

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.160
it was like

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.119
soy it's always making us [ __ ] gay oh

00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:41.440
my god and then another comment he

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.440
posted it was great he was like he

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.440
tagged her name it's like chikara or

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.359
some [ __ ] yeah and he was like what do

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:48.160
you

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.680
he was like that came out a little

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.320
aggressive uh he was like what he's like

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.440
what do you think about the word

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.040
transgender do you believe that that's a

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.319
real thing

00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:57.760
what did she say she was like i mean

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.960
there's yes it's real

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.800
he's like there are transgender people

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.960
so yes

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.520
yeah it's uh it'll be funny to watch

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.599
black dudes have to suffer

00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:11.440
the wave of wokeness after they're just

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.040
kind of like what i thought

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.119
waves are rocking against that levy

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:16.720
right now man it's like they they're

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.680
definitely going to be able to make fun

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.040
of chinese people for another couple

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.480
years yeah that's what we're taking away

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.760
we're still making fun of it we're still

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.440
allowed to make it the tides the tides

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.800
touching our ankles on that one well

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.880
thankfully he's running out abc had a

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.200
show called off the boat about an asian

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.520
immigrant family so that's that that's

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.640
all it's about

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.560
white people make fun of chinese people

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.640
no it's it's helping us be like oh wow i

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.800
didn't realize they had it so tough

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.480
i'll be nicer to the [ __ ] chinese in

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.160
my neighborhood i'm never mean to them

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.480
no i just i just like they're funny

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.480
they're stupid i i can't control the

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.079
[ __ ] around there i can't control the

00:41:48.079 --> 00:41:50.079
fact that when i see like an old asian

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:51.040
man

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.960
just in like [ __ ] dungarees pulled up

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.640
to his [ __ ] shoulders dude just like

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.880
stretching in the park i'm like

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.960
i see that and i it's hilarious

00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.760
he's

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.880
he's assimilating wrong like he's got

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.880
the pants he bought the pants

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.319
he did the right thing by getting the

00:42:06.319 --> 00:42:07.359
outfit

00:42:07.359 --> 00:42:08.800
but he's wearing it wrong because he

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.200
doesn't know and that's hilarious

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.200
like they got bikes that's funny but

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.560
then they're like it's like yeah that's

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.160
normal but then they put like plastic

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.160
bags over their hands to keep them warm

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.319
and it's like oh you got it wrong

00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:23.359
that's not what we do here it's funny

00:42:23.359 --> 00:42:26.160
it is funny yeah so but yeah the of all

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.760
the accents that's the funniest in the

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.000
world

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.520
but when you hear like an asian couple

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.000
fight in like chinese and the guy is

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.200
like

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.720
dude

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.440
yeah the way they're [ __ ] like

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.079
just the way they display emotion in the

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:48.560
language

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.280
these are all very different that was

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.200
like japanese and vietnamese but

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.960
whatever

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.480
um but yeah we were talking about the

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.079
black uh

00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:05.359
black guys having to get hit with the

00:43:05.359 --> 00:43:06.880
wokeness right now

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.240
it start i'm telling you that [ __ ]

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.400
cam newton was a shot across the bow you

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.160
think he was that was the uh the white

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.920
ladies are coming for that was the franz

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.079
ferdinand that was the [ __ ] arch dude

00:43:16.079 --> 00:43:18.000
getting [ __ ] pop

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.400
the feminist popped him like you they

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.160
probably planted that lady

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.760
so for for those of you who didn't see

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.119
this a few weeks ago i'm sure you did

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:27.680
but it's uh this reporter was talking to

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.760
cam newton after a game and she was

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.839
talking about like running routes she

00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:33.760
was like what do you think about the uh

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.720
she's talking about i think about that

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.200
physically the physicality of

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.640
what he was laughing at was her saying

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.560
running routes yeah

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.000
she was talking about the routes yeah

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.440
but the wide outs were running and he

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.119
and he while she was talking he like

00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:46.880
giggled and then stopped

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.960
and then when she finished her question

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.079
he was like

00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:51.359
he was kind of smiling he's like it's

00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:53.200
just funny to hear a

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.960
female talking about running routes and

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.319
then he answered the question we

00:43:56.319 --> 00:43:58.240
probably imagined a girl in a football

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.920
helmet trying to run routes and

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.960
genuinely was like that's so funny

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.839
to think of um

00:44:05.839 --> 00:44:07.839
yeah that's

00:44:07.839 --> 00:44:09.040
yeah it's like well there's that one

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.000
football league where they play in

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.560
lingerie yeah that's so [ __ ]

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.119
demoralizing dude oh my god you guys

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:17.119

how many people are like great i'll play

00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:24.079

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.000
game my [ __ ] would never

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.440
my last [ __ ] did

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.880
[ __ ] was playing rugby dude she's out

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:38.960
there different though no it's not i

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.640
mean it's not lingerie yeah but it's

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.720
still like why don't you take it easy

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.720
true what are you [ __ ] truck sticking

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.480
other girls for it just

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.160
it's funny i've watched girls rugby i

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.920
guess guys rugby similar but like girls

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.839
rugby is just like you see it it's just

00:44:51.839 --> 00:44:54.160
like a one giant mass of pasty thighs

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.920
just [ __ ] scrambling they all lock up

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.280
and it's just like a big white spider

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.000
it's like it's like little kid soccer

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.400
that's just a swarm around the ball

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.079
they can never pitch it out and have a

00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:07.359
break

00:45:07.359 --> 00:45:09.520
it's just constant scrum

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.359
it's like a charlie brown cartoon the

00:45:11.359 --> 00:45:12.800
whole time just like a big dust cloud

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.079
being like

00:45:14.079 --> 00:45:15.599
left to right i was watching it i guess

00:45:15.599 --> 00:45:18.960
that was like 2010 11

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.720
so it was right before the whole

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.560
wokeness thing broke yeah that's

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.800
probably intolerable now women's rugby

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.760
out there

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.720
uh of being like women's rugby yeah

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.400
they're probably the ultimate [ __ ]

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.400
woke lgbt

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.680

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.760
guys up yeah that's true it's probably

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.680
brutal now it was teetering on that when

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.359
i was there that was just their natural

00:45:43.359 --> 00:45:46.880
testosterone at that point i went to a

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.040
party with my ex-girlfriend after at the

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.880
female rugby house yeah was it the male

show up later pretty much that's a

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.000
pretty brutal squad too so yeah they're

00:49:59.839 --> 00:50:01.599
gear turn around events

00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:04.079
it's just like super bowl xx4 xxx

00:50:04.079 --> 00:50:05.880
baltimore crab fest 98.

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.319
[Laughter]

00:50:08.319 --> 00:50:10.559
they're good boys

00:50:10.559 --> 00:50:12.000
i mean people try to give it i've seen

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.440
those articles where they're like why

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.440
latino men need to do this oh yeah

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.240
because there's a lot of gay latinx

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.680
yeah in america

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.359
true that are like

00:50:21.359 --> 00:50:23.040
our culture is

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.160
well yeah that's another weird thing

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.200
well i think there's a lot of they're

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.520
still proud of their culture but it's

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.079
it's very [ __ ] patriarchal and

00:50:30.079 --> 00:50:32.160
[ __ ] like dude

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.000
yeah it's crazy watch selena dude her

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.599
dad didn't even let her like tour have

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:37.119
her own boyfriend yeah

00:50:37.119 --> 00:50:38.839
selena's dad is the

00:50:38.839 --> 00:50:41.200
ultimate it's because of catholicism

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.640
which was forced on them by the white

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.119
man exactly so in the end they can i

00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:47.440
think a lot of the latino homosexuality

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.760
is more like rage and passion based so

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.200
you have such a bone to pick with your

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.720
[ __ ] amigo dude that you're just like

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.319
you don't understand you [ __ ] bend

00:50:54.319 --> 00:50:55.280
them over

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.359
oh you're talking about gayness yeah i

00:50:57.359 --> 00:50:58.640
think it comes more there's more comes

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.640
from like passion it's like momentary

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.160
blips of where they're like oh my god so

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.079
[ __ ] we just [ __ ] like the chupacabra

00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:05.599
dude yeah i mean i don't want to go back

00:51:05.599 --> 00:51:08.240
into that terry's out there that's

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.000
probably that's probably when he came

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.920
about is when

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.520
the white liberal ladies came to like

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.200
the incas and we're like you guys got to

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.800
stop seeing fake and they're like oh

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.480
[ __ ] you through the woods

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:22.599
they formed in the troop dude

00:51:24.079 --> 00:51:25.920
yeah they uh

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.520
i don't know it's just it will be funny

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:28.720
when

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.319
it is funny to think about white chicks

00:51:30.319 --> 00:51:32.319
slowly [ __ ] like popping back behind

00:51:32.319 --> 00:51:33.119
different

00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:34.720
different groups yeah you're past two

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.559
yeah come here come with us yeah and

00:51:36.559 --> 00:51:39.040
then they they sucked everybody in yeah

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.040
we are all oppressed stand up against

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.119
the patriarchy and the white man yep and

00:51:43.119 --> 00:51:44.800
then one by one they're starting to eat

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.599
themselves yeah black men change or get

00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:50.079
the [ __ ] out yep i think the whole

00:51:50.079 --> 00:51:51.680
thing's designed for like people to read

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.599
their blog or something like subscribe

00:51:53.599 --> 00:51:55.520

yep read my things oh well that's

00:51:57.599 --> 00:51:59.599
another thing that kind of goes along

00:51:59.599 --> 00:52:01.760
the line of like with history like when

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.680
you see something in history look it up

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.079
yeah if you hear some [ __ ] like like

00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:08.480
what wall street we built that it's like

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.400
google it yeah see what happens

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.319

00:52:12.319 --> 00:52:13.839
headlines

00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:15.920
yo yeah that's all that is when you read

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.359
it's like this this happened and it's

00:52:17.359 --> 00:52:19.680
like well i'm sure it wasn't as easy as

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.680
simple as that yeah like trump daddy's

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.280
phone call to that [ __ ]

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.200
widow yeah it's like somebody filmed it

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.119
you can watch it and decide for yourself

00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:28.480
what you thought

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.319
yeah instead of like trump disrespect

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.119
uh i saw one phone call oh so they have

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:37.359

00:52:37.359 --> 00:52:39.920
there was two but i saw one

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:40.960
[ __ ]

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.359
and so the big controversy was him

00:52:43.359 --> 00:52:46.880
saying he knew what he signed up for

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.800
but he when i listened to it in my

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.760
opinion

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.440
it didn't sound like you heard the whole

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.240
transcript yeah oh wow yeah it's out

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.680
there yeah she's talking about her fans

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.640
somebody told me that they're like do

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:57.920
you believe he said that and i was like

00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.599
what else did he say no i don't yeah i

00:52:59.599 --> 00:53:01.200
don't believe he called a widow and was

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.040
like well guess what he knew what he

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.800
signed up for talk to me

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.240
yeah it's like no he called and was like

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.000
it was amazing that he did that knowing

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.440
what he signed up for

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.760
yeah

00:53:12.319 --> 00:53:13.760
obviously he wasn't that articulate i

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.359
think i'm giving him too much credit but

00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:16.800
that's what he meant yeah i mean that

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.559
all i mean again and the fact that he

00:53:18.559 --> 00:53:19.839
calls widows

00:53:19.839 --> 00:53:22.079
yeah that was not a thing previous

00:53:22.079 --> 00:53:24.240
presidents did yeah usually get a little

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.760
letter or something like that yeah just

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.240
a little letterhead yeah imagine trump

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.319
calling him like oh i'm sorry your son's

00:53:30.319 --> 00:53:31.280
dead

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.599
over sorry he knew what he was getting

00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:35.520
into die

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.640
no more

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.000
he's dead

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.760
you got to move on it's just really bad

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.200
i mean

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.400
dude that would

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.400
really bad people killed him

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.559
the worst they killed him

00:53:46.559 --> 00:53:48.880
they're very bad dude that would be so

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.640
weird to have him call you

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.200
trump hi it did sound weird she had him

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.400
on speakerphone and they were filming

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.720
her talking to him and he was very

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.160
[ __ ]

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.240

00:54:01.839 --> 00:54:03.200
family and their sons and [ __ ] and like

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.040
what everybody does like so-and-so's a

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.559
football player she's a cheerleader

00:54:06.559 --> 00:54:08.480
she's a singer it's like we got a house

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.640
full of stars and he was like wow really

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:13.440
incredible really incredible kids

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.319

psycho he is a [ __ ] psycho i mean of

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.760
course well yeah he's got the worst

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.200
accent whatever voice he has

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.960

how much of a [ __ ] like

00:54:29.359 --> 00:54:31.440
psycho and powerful that guy is that he

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.280
overcame

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.480
his [ __ ] voice to take power

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.400
that's true i just think that you can't

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.319
even speak publicly him taking all that

00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:42.000
negativity daily and just being like

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.319

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.240
blind man's bluff is when someone's in

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.599
the deep end so you're in the deep end

01:07:45.599 --> 01:07:47.039
and you just you gotta swim around with

01:07:47.039 --> 01:07:49.280
your eyes closed and people are like so

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.480
you're just like this and people are

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.920
standing that you know there's like a

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.520
coping on the side of a pool where it's

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.559
like

01:07:54.559 --> 01:07:56.160
like a brick material basically and then

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.240
there's like the stucco or whatever

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.319
concrete patio so there's like a you

01:08:00.319 --> 01:08:01.599
know there's like a bordering to the

01:08:01.599 --> 01:08:02.640
edge of a pool that like you have to

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.240
keep the side of your one of your feet

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.920
on and you got to go around and then

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.680
jump in and swim past the guy with his

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.280
eyes closed while he's just like this

trying to feel and touch someone yeah as

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.319

that dog in front of me whoo

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.400
you grabbed tilly by her neck and she

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.400

season 1 yelped and i was just i didn't

01:14:59.679 --> 01:15:00.800
get whoa

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.400
i got [ __ ] up from caesar milan

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.880
because like i would watch your show and

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.040
i fully when i had the akita when i was

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.679
married in my head i was just like

01:15:09.679 --> 01:15:11.199
all right so i can like hit them but i

01:15:11.199 --> 01:15:13.040
have to pretend i'm a wolf while i do it

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.480
and i was like perfect and i would be

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.800
like the [ __ ] bed and like push them

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.520
out

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.040
i would try to simulate like dog

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.480
violence on my dog

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.560
this dog that caitlyn has needs some

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.960
violence

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.600
my dog

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.400
brittany's dog who's my dog now

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.800
uh chewed up that hdmi cord and i

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.719
smacked her [ __ ] ass pretty hard yeah

01:15:34.719 --> 01:15:36.080
she didn't chew up anything ever again

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.520
so it's like

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.600
you can't mercilessly beat your dog but

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:40.800
if your dog chews up something that's

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.480
worth a hundred bucks you could smack

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.239
his [ __ ] ass in my in my opinion you

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:46.159
can be like

01:15:46.159 --> 01:15:48.560
a firm one agreed you know because it

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.239
makes sense because dogs don't have like

01:15:50.239 --> 01:15:51.679
if you're flailing limbs at a dog

01:15:51.679 --> 01:15:53.360
they're like what the [ __ ] is what is

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.880
this they only know mouths and like

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.320
biting and stuff

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.360
so

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.960
but i mean if you got to smack your dog

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.560
on the ass you know you got to do it

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.960
quietly in your own home [ __ ] good

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.040
but only you can't take your day out on

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.760
it but even at the dog park dude my the

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.760

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:11.600

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.920
this isn't your dog it's my friend's

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:35.440
daughter and i'm like sorry you're i was

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.120
ready to fight this guy wait what were

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.800
the dogs doing my dog was doing that

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.520
[ __ ] your dog was attacking a dog

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.640
40 pounds it's not attacking it's

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.679
playing it doesn't matter if it's 40.

01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:45.520
it's called malcolm it's mouthing dude

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.280
it's 40 pounds and it's it's a 40 pound

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.120
ball of muscle

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:51.440
hold on it'll hold on to the dog's neck

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.360
and the dog goes and then it gets off

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.480
but it's like that's the way dogs

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.520
communicate

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.440
so i'm like dude just chill

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.920
to expect human grade behavior from dogs

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:02.400
to me is insane no let them snarl and

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.960
snap at each other to bring a dog that

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.640
[ __ ] up all the other dogs at the dog

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.080
park

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.800
sometimes human behavior it's you

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.360
i'm not gonna not socialize it dude

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.560
i'm not saying that but if it

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.960
continuously is biting other dogs even

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.360
if it's playing yeah you gotta be like i

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.719
break it up and i scold it but there's

01:18:20.719 --> 01:18:22.560
only one way out of it it's for it to

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.040
learn to not do that so dogs there's

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.560
gonna be a way some other people's dogs

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.400
that have to pay the price yeah

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.159
yeah do you understand why people might

01:18:30.159 --> 01:18:32.560
be like i have a nice

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.640
[ __ ] like black lab

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:37.280
yep if your dog bit my dog

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.199
it's not biting though it's playing if

01:18:39.199 --> 01:18:40.800
it hurt it while they were playing it's

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.159
not hurting that's the thing it's just

01:18:42.159 --> 01:18:43.520
going the dog's going like letting it

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:46.159
know the dogs when dogs fight for real

01:18:46.159 --> 01:18:47.920
you know it that's yeah

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.679
so like this dog going like that's

01:18:49.679 --> 01:18:51.120
that's the only way a dog can say oh

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.640
chill out that's too much so you got to

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.640
let them do their own thing and you got

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.880
to let dogs snarl and snap at each other

01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.719
because it's weird to like if you can't

01:18:58.719 --> 01:19:00.880
socialize them right if they don't fully

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.640
express like get the [ __ ] off they

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.640

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.920
see a dog's teeth people like oh my god

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.440

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.440

01:23:01.679 --> 01:23:03.199

i have i have training class dude

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.840
saturday i get up at 8 a.m i bring him

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.239
to uh spca when you dog i haven't talked

01:23:08.239 --> 01:23:09.520
to that [ __ ] trainer about your

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.880
theories she don't give it she doesn't

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.560
care i wear a [ __ ] home depot belt

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.520
full of treats and i [ __ ]

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.719
did you

01:23:16.719 --> 01:23:19.440
did you read a book on dogs no i didn't

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.800
so what are you talking about i just go

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.880
off of [ __ ] i piece together dude i know

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.560
so these theories you it sounded like

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.080
you were educated on this oh i have

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.679
researched about akitas and stuff yeah

01:23:27.679 --> 01:23:28.719
that's what i'm saying i read about

01:23:28.719 --> 01:23:30.320
caesar milan and he put a bunch of bad

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.440
[ __ ] in my head that i'm trying to get

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.320
out of there

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.920
but you do got to let them just express

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.280
themselves to each other

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.800
because like imagine if you and i like

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.239
would only ever start a conversation

01:23:38.239 --> 01:23:39.679
people come up like get the [ __ ] pull

01:23:39.679 --> 01:23:42.560
out imagine

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.520
one of us is constantly like sucking the

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.199
other one in the face

01:23:47.199 --> 01:23:49.679
no it's not like that

01:23:49.679 --> 01:23:51.600
it's not like that for dogs somebody can

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.920
be like maybe stop sending the guy that

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:57.360
keeps coming apart and punching everyone

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:58.719
but it wouldn't be punching it would be

01:23:58.719 --> 01:24:00.320
like just someone trapping you an

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.760
annoying conversation just like oh my

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:02.880
god guess what

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.960
even then [ __ ] them true get him out of

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.800
here he's got to learn the boy is going

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.440

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.239
nobody likes me there

01:24:12.239 --> 01:24:13.920
if anyone's somewhat nice to me there i

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.440
leave i'm like what a great [ __ ]

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.120
person that they know they get it dude

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.800
not every dog is perfect

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.560
somebody's probably like hey what's

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.000
going on you're like i'm pretty much a

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.520
wolf right now i'm trying to trade this

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.280
dog he's got to learn how to interact

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.639
socially with each other you got to let

bites the [ __ ] out of it it's nice but

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.679
here's the thing when i break it up that

01:25:39.679 --> 01:25:41.040
dog comes back to start playing again

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:41.840
because they're just playing they're

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.960
having fun he's just being like dude

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.719

01:25:44.719 --> 01:25:46.320
i'm not talking about the other dog's

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.600
feelings yeah talking about the other

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.679
dog's owner's feelings irrelevant to me

01:25:49.679 --> 01:25:50.719
that's my thing it's like dude this

01:25:50.719 --> 01:25:52.639

a [ __ ] [ __ ] for this but if you

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.600

[ __ ] rambunctious he'll get it out

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.360
he's still young yeah

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.120
