Italian they call him low what the [ __ ]

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.560
man a half hour late we're starting

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.209
today and I had so much fun stuff to

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.140
talk about

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.600
Shane Gillis came in and we were all

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.030
goosed up by the Eagles and and

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.530
congratulations black little I'm not

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.030
gonna be a bad sport I wasn't rooting

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.350
for the Cowboys but I'll tell you what

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.150
this week I am and it's not because of

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.700
which is the easier team I want

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.100
ultimately I do like the storyline more

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.110
of the Eagles not getting swept by the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.790
Cowboys and getting a chance to beat

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.150
them

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.709
I like their emotion behind that more

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.519
but also just be cutter and cares and I

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.709
think it just be a more fun thing to see

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.870
I don't want is the possibility I think

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.459
I'd rather be three times to one team

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.299
season right there Lords do yeah was the

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.220

the Eagles black blue your thoughts at

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.400
all when that game I mean that was

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.090
insane

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.669
it wasn't saying great game even though

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.740
I don't equals Craig name but give the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.389
Eagles defense some credit they blocked

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:56.230
the field goal them credit yeah don't

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.900
blame in the kicker no man it got

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.490
clipped really that's all this I will

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.110
say that's all this [ __ ] talk if the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.450
Eagles are close with the Saints at all

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.520
yeah man they deserve to miss a [ __ ]

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.760
field goal like I mean obviously I like

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.830
the Eagles but I felt horrible for that

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.810
[ __ ] kicker good god you know it's

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.900
crazy it was uh was it against the

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.180
Cowboys the Cowboys game the Eagles lost

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.130
was the nail on the coffin wasn't didn't

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.710
didn't they miss a kick or what was the

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.450
quite a crazy kicked this season against

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.210
the Eagles someone have like a 62 yarder

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.530
that happens happens against the Giants

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.570
to the giant last year and that was like

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.919
the beginning of their season just taken

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.080
off so they kind of that season got

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.400
kicked into high gear from a field goal

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.470
the game that I thought they lost this

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.090
year where I was like that's pretty much

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.860
mathematical to people I thought it was

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.360
the Panthers that somebody hit on that

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.790
and they were up 17 nothing no there was

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.830
one that was when I was like all this

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.210
season's over there was a kick there was

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.650
a field goal that ended a gamer and I

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.150
was like wow their season gets ended

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.729
this year by a field goal it turned

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:58.270
around

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.190
wasn't it Dallas no hardcore Eagles fans

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.320
screaming at his radio right now I

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.580
thought we beat you by a field goal and

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.800
then you had two games left

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.000
but whatever it wouldn't be the Rams

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.830
there's a crazy far field goal maybe I

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.450
just don't remember but whatever it was

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.400
it was it was a 62 yard field goal I

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.340
thought was it - yeah that's strong it

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.500
was to get that way it was a yard

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.530
further than Wow Kelly do remember I

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.630
said it ended there I thought it ended

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.580
their season and then a missed field

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.440
goal from the base it's weird how much

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.539
field goal kicking is meant to the core

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:33.910
- and I know I showed the montage of the

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.430
five either way post he's in this year

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.100
alone NBC had a queued up there they

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.419
were just like I this [ __ ]

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.180
gonna miss good produce that [ __ ] up did

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.040
you see that do oh yeah

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.600
three in one game against Miami alone

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.389
which was insane it's all crossbar or

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.230
you know crazy he was evil for a minute

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.200
yeah Cody Marquis yeah but I mean what

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.110
what's his code eparchy what's his I'll

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.450
tell you what he's so happy and if you

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.520
have to take positive it was a playoff

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.370
game so you get to disappear now you

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.900
have to be on the sidelines getting

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.639
hounded for the next couple weeks but he

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.280
is no way can he come back on that field

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.720
next year there's no chance to keep him

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.419
Scott Norwood no [ __ ] chance he comes

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.220
back in fact he shouldn't be there now

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.010
he should already be gone it did get

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.610
blocked did get tipped and still had

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.100

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.409
to the audience after that I mean

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.210
WorldStarHipHop had this arm the mascot

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.310
Falls like he was in platoon at the end

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.130
he went down hard

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.959
after watching it live you didn't know

00:08:43.959 --> 00:08:46.300
if it clinked and then thought it clank

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.170
to one end me too

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.300
I didn't realize it hit two but double

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.459
to like as Collinsworth said it's really

00:08:51.459 --> 00:08:55.060
yeah the seasons gonna end dude what a

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.800
great call we were talking about this

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.240
earlier do you think Congress would just

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.069
beat this [ __ ] out of Jay in a fight or

00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:05.019

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:10.569
little bit old-school Pat Summerall in

00:09:10.569 --> 00:09:12.430
him like he's just throwing back

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.350
cocktails the broadcast I swear to you

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:19.269
all Bulldog Bulldog this is what would

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:20.860
happen because the reason the stars got

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.569
wallet chains and stuff you can use in a

00:09:22.569 --> 00:09:24.699
fight I come with weapons yeah this is

00:09:24.699 --> 00:09:26.440
all the type of [ __ ] that a guy like

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.089
Collins would see and be like it just

00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:33.130
riff raff out of my tag him once or

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.779
twice and then be like carry him away so

00:09:34.779 --> 00:09:36.699

00:09:36.699 --> 00:09:37.870
of times you went can no way people

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.050

the move but doesn't mean it happen

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.610

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.760
the Comedy Cellar

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.450
a few weeks ago Artie fuqua the host was

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.450
on stage and there's a live band that

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:46.110
plays red and Jeremy and they started

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.450
playing the ignition remix and the whole

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.430
audience and already were singing along

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.440
and doing it I mean dancing and and

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.430
singing along

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.010
drunk and happy and I was got on stage

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:57.330
and I was like such an interesting

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:58.140
that's so weird

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.120
there's people have been outside this

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.230
club protester Louie

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:04.410
for pulling his dick out in front of an

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.480
adult and presenting it and they run

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.890
away I'm not saying he's it's not a

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.210
fucked-up thing or whatever I may be

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.090
making a judgment call on that as a good

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.350
thing or a bad thing it's a bad thing

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.630
that what Louie did but this guy's been

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.250
hissing and [ __ ] pissing on the

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.340
[ __ ] children and he slipped through

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.190
the cracks if anything we've mapped out

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.530

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.950
wheelhouse like 14 to 17 the thing about

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:09.419
the cellar incidents like the r.kelly

00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:12.060
stuff and the Louie CK stuff and just

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.070
looking at all this it's like we've been

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.470
hearing about this our Kelly stuff for

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:18.990
years so why is that all of a sudden now

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:21.000
everybody's gonna go well now I [ __ ]

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.950
hate them like now I think he's a bad

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:25.530
guy now I don't like any of his stuff

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:26.700
and that was the same thing bluie I'm

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.589
like those rumors have been it's been

00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:30.240
circulating around comedy was a creep

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.800
forever and it was wet handy Kindler

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.149
brought up it's like guys have all known

00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:34.710
this all of a sudden you hate the guy

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.990
and so you don't know how much of its

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:38.879
like genuine concern for other people

00:34:38.879 --> 00:34:40.830
and how much of it's just like you want

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.230
to look good to other people yeah for

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:44.940
sure because when you could let it go he

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:48.119
does seem to ten like oh I mean with

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:50.220
this guy it's there's so many of like

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.899
the Michael Jack it is crazy I'm like

00:34:51.899 --> 00:34:54.240
Michael Jackson's like beloved and went

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.099
down as a legend and it's like he may

00:34:56.099 --> 00:34:58.830
have been [ __ ] children yeah it's a

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.260
controversial legend for sure and that

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.150
was the one the whole public kind of

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.440
brushed it under the rug we're like yeah

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:08.400
we maybe know but you know I also like

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.869
don't think like it's great that Cosby

00:35:09.869 --> 00:35:12.450
went down before he died like he is

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.460
still going to have a legacy of like

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.020
putting out one of the greatest sitcoms

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:21.570
of all no he's not no he's not they're

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.670
gonna go oh he was a horrible guy but

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:25.530
like this you this show people will

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:28.730
watch that show for morbid curiosity now

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.950
known as aggressive so that saved the

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:35.430
sitcom the family sitcom they're gonna

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.050
race it from history it's gonna be like

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:41.820
[ __ ] Chris Benoit and WWE yeah that's

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.080
the guy that killed his high school like

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.260
it's like he didn't exist because they

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.820
do it's part of the story I think they

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.470
should do that I think it should be part

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:50.779
of story but they

00:35:50.779 --> 00:35:53.759
all this is a reminder of like do like

00:35:53.759 --> 00:35:56.369
don't [ __ ] look up or idolize people

00:35:56.369 --> 00:35:59.099
just because they're talented it's a

00:35:59.099 --> 00:36:00.809
problem with across the board well I

00:36:00.809 --> 00:36:03.539
mean I have a think again Louie's all

00:36:03.539 --> 00:36:06.689
louis ck's punishment quote-unquote

00:36:06.689 --> 00:36:10.499
punishment has come from the public

00:36:10.499 --> 00:36:13.910
opinion like what's making making people

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.989
cut his work or whatever you know or

00:36:15.989 --> 00:36:17.130
thing like that

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.049
i don't know if this is gonna like I

00:36:19.049 --> 00:36:21.449
mean are Kelly is like he's not in any

00:36:21.449 --> 00:36:22.609
kind of trouble

00:36:22.609 --> 00:36:24.749
my question is almost where they take

00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:26.009
Louie that took his movie out of the

00:36:26.009 --> 00:36:26.910
theater and never came out in the

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:28.650
theater they took all of his shows off

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:31.049
the air is our Kelly songs are they in

00:36:31.049 --> 00:36:43.160
the system here little put out became a

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.739
[ __ ] yeah it was it was an opera and

00:36:49.739 --> 00:36:58.140
then at one point he's like what's the

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.479
song that Stern broke down one time I

00:37:00.479 --> 00:37:03.329
confess or something it's on our

00:37:03.329 --> 00:37:06.539
conventions it's just him talking can't

00:37:06.539 --> 00:37:11.039
read so good I can fast I can't spell

00:37:11.039 --> 00:37:13.289
for [ __ ] he was saying I can piss and

00:37:13.289 --> 00:37:15.989
they're like you got to change it I feel

00:37:15.989 --> 00:37:17.489
like even if every big came out there's

00:37:17.489 --> 00:37:18.989
people where it's like they still might

00:37:18.989 --> 00:37:21.660
enjoy the song ignition when it comes on

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.549
you go oh wow he's a bad guy but I still

00:37:23.549 --> 00:37:24.839
like this song their thing about the

00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:26.459
Louis set that came out there's a girl

00:37:26.459 --> 00:37:27.509
that wrote like an article and a

00:37:27.509 --> 00:37:30.269
feminist blog about it and her most

00:37:30.269 --> 00:37:31.739
appalling thing was that there was

00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:33.589
anybody laughing at what he had to say

00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:36.420
like she thought that it was so horrible

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.880
that anybody could find a funny person

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.769
fun day see do they believe I always

00:37:40.769 --> 00:37:42.209
think that's interesting when one person

00:37:42.209 --> 00:37:44.369
an audience is angry at you I've had

00:37:44.369 --> 00:37:45.929
them like the one person but you know

00:37:45.929 --> 00:37:48.089
this is awful it's terrible so do you

00:37:48.089 --> 00:37:49.589
think there's a group psychosis

00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:51.749
happening around you like is that maybe

00:37:51.749 --> 00:37:53.819
this isn't your thing or it's not you

00:37:53.819 --> 00:37:55.349
know whatever it's such a weird thing

00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:58.439
that goes like this sucks it's like if

00:37:58.439 --> 00:38:00.269
everyone hated this in the room and you

00:38:00.269 --> 00:38:02.130
were like to go but it's just if you're

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.450
the one person yes

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:05.010
a weird thing that come up like that

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.860
that harsh this is terrible and every

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.020
somehow you found a room full of idiots

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.840
that don't know that that's like that's

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.470
how legends are made

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.700
that's the thesis he put on the wall he

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.710
was like this actually sucks and

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.180
everyone was like what it's almost

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.970
because we know it sucked it was pretty

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:28.320
great play more this just didn't know

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.880
that it was a point in time

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.829
oh yeah this is one of his there was

00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:37.509
around or a girl that knew something

00:38:37.509 --> 00:38:40.240
oh I don't with this this girl here so a

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.539
girl made the sex tapes like got out and

00:38:43.539 --> 00:38:46.470
and if someone was started blackmailing

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.809
him to get the sex tapes back our Kelly

00:38:49.809 --> 00:38:53.650
that she's in and she says as a decide

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.480
for yourself are Kelly's trying to make

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.980
it seem like she's extorting him for

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.319
money but she said she took the tape and

00:38:59.319 --> 00:39:01.119
gave it to somebody else like to hold

00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:03.400
which time yeah and then that person

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.529
ended up like trying to extort him for

00:39:05.529 --> 00:39:08.049
money but could you imagine what kind of

00:39:08.049 --> 00:39:09.910
extortion do you pay when a guy goes I

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:13.210

lifelong contract of X amount of dollars

went to the domestic abuse website and

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.630
looked up there's a list of 17 questions

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:39.190
and she goes there was only two or three

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:41.260
things that our Kelly hadn't done all

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.240

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:02.620
decisions

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.810

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.380

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:08.950
much more colorful conversation she

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:10.600

using intimidation or threats to gain

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:08.599
horrible person I really am each other

00:58:08.599 --> 00:58:13.400
well guys a wild abuse will continue at

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:14.569
the bottom and any of these are

00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:15.890
happening your relationship talk to

00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:18.380
someone definitely don't take this with

00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:22.279
your partner but this is talking it out

00:58:22.279 --> 00:58:23.539
this is talking to somebody

00:58:23.539 --> 00:58:25.339
this is airing it out would you say

00:58:25.339 --> 00:58:28.910
Christine well you better say if any of

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:31.369
them are happening if any of them were

00:58:31.369 --> 00:58:33.140

but what my friends Steve the

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:47.240
photographer he totally gets me I think

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.559
this test was designed to make

00:58:48.559 --> 00:58:50.319
boyfriend's feel shitty

00:58:50.319 --> 00:58:53.720
I think an abusive lady wrote this list

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.730
Canadian boyfriend's is the best thing

00:58:55.730 --> 00:59:00.559
ever not give her any of your soup so

00:59:00.559 --> 00:59:02.359
your partner not give you any of the elk

00:59:02.359 --> 00:59:04.730
jerky she forgot to plug up the maple

00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:08.660
syrup tree there was super learn you

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:11.569
dumb [ __ ] Canadians [ __ ] you

00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:14.660
your test sucks I wonder what the things

00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:17.000
are Kelly did what did is I wonder if

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.880
the ex-wife says what he did it all

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:22.279
technically to her dude I mean there any

00:59:22.279 --> 00:59:25.910
allegations from her like outright the

00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:27.950
one said he [ __ ] gave her the old

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:29.930
goro for mortal count like strangled her

00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:31.309
picked her up

00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:32.299
you said he picked her up and put

00:59:32.299 --> 00:59:34.549
brought her eye to eye yeah that's a

00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:36.650
[ __ ] Power Move yeah she's five foot

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:38.150
one so you want to make some eye contact

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:39.079
he picked her up

00:59:39.079 --> 00:59:43.460
I just wrote about this I wonder how

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:44.779
many of these girls who left the

00:59:44.779 --> 00:59:46.579

00:59:46.579 --> 00:59:48.740
like sour grapes though too if they're

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:51.740
feeling like he booted them oh yeah you

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:54.289
sound like a black dude from Philly

00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:55.540
right now

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:59.850
is the line because they got sour grapes

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:02.800

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:09.190
