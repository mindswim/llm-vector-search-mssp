WEBVTT

00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:18.320
[Music]

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.019
1:12 peaches-and-cream yeah we were

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.310
actually just talking about peaches and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.720
cream anyway we're just talking about

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.269
female sexuality yeah and how much we

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.210
[ __ ] hate it now dude [ __ ] stop

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.750
penis I just read a book on sexuality oh

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.940
you did yeah we're just like the like

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.379
the whole female Enterprise like what

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.360
they're up to what the [ __ ] are they up

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.129
to I got a decent idea but I mean they

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.730
used a they use the myth of Aphrodite

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.559
and psyche to try to like to map out

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.800
like why like what what's woman's like

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.000
ultimate quest because they basically

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.190
like dudes quest is in these stories is

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.530
like you go out like it's like the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.879
Petersons thing you go out into chaos

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.039
and like you try to like make something

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.449
of yourself and you go on these like you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.460
want like quests basically so another

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.049
like that's like dude psychology like

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.400
going out and trying to conquer and all

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.470
that stuff which plays out if you think

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.909
about it it's like that actually plays

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.939
out the they're saying women's thing is

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.009
more like identify and it's like you say

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.360
this [ __ ] anymore you get crucified but

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.220
it's like the idea for most well I'm

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.680
glad we're opening with it the idea

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.630
according to this book for most women

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.729
and like their heart of hearts then you

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.320
don't think about like a cultural veneer

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.270
or anything it's like what makes them

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.439
tick and these are guys who have liked

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.810
seeing women clinically like thousands

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.460
of them over the course of 25 years and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.009
they're seeing a lot of it is like

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.810
wanting to I they want to like find a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.280
dude who's out there like crushing it

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.369
and then identify and bond onto them mmm

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.869
so that's like that's kind of the quest

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.310
but in order to do that instead of like

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.810
they're like being out there and [ __ ]

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.850
like you know and it's not even just the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.049
fact that it's women it's the fact that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.180
like you know if like your girlfriend

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.159
dunked a basketball you'd be like all

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.340
right like talking nearly touch the back

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.840
foam on the back so there was never like

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.940
like a strong drive for women to go out

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.290
there and [ __ ] like France

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.569
I can do like yeah because it's a plate

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.310
and people who are like the whole point

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.450
of it was for like a woman to like I

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.099
they want to identify and bond to a

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.680
strong dude that they like you know that

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.200
like that they can kind of like get

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.650
their mail yeah you know they won't like

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.180
it strong enough man where they can like

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.829
that can satisfy the male part of them

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.299
otherwise they have to tap into their

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.629
own inner animus oh oh [ __ ] which is an

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.909
interesting side point is because as

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.739
dudes now for some reason are getting

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.290
more like feminine feminine basically

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.090
yeah I mean how they're like I'm not

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.389
like dude and that's like yeah

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.579
supposedly that the cool thing that's

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.769
like in vogue right now but it's really

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.599
you're just it's the men are now are

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.310
tapping into their inner or inner animal

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.799
I get in a level with this girl's animus

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.689
it's weird but if you do comes along

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.060
strong enough he's just like yo [ __ ]

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.530
knock that [ __ ] off and they will not

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.560
does like I [ __ ] so yeah the whole

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.959
point of it I get kind of lost in my own

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.090
stuff oh it's like so instead of a guy

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.069
so like a guy out questing and doing

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.989
[ __ ] girls is like want to be hot as

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.239
[ __ ] so it's a snow white Ameth of like

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.739
looking in the mirror like is anyone

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.150
hotter than me so they're in this battle

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.590
of like trying to establish hot rank

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.579
like at all times

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.949
yeah to get the guy who's on the sickest

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.099
quest for sure yeah that's I mean yes

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.870
now that's the myth of Aphrodite and

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.909
psyches like but psyche is like the the

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.859
archetype of like the the young

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.479
beautiful virgin who people are like

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.829
she's so beautiful and virginal like

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.000
people don't even want to touch her it's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.109
like the Virgin Mary thing it's like

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.299
just this pure womanhood and Aphrodite

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.829
is like the chaotic like I'm the

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.659
prettiest in a land in Aphrodite he's

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.090
always trying to [ __ ] with psyche leave

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.459
psyche alone dude I love psyche

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.769
yeah well that's the story of Aphrodite

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.780
stop being a [ __ ] [ __ ] they all have

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.189
that inner Aphrodite dude it's one of

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.889
the new girl comes around say yeah of

00:03:58.889 --> 00:03:59.280

dudes pick up on this one they're in a

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.659
social setting like I'll watch dudes try

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.459
to like establish some sort of dominance

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.139
within the like a social setting and

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.720
it's just nature playing out but yeah

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.940

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.229
the [ __ ] am i doing yeah they base they

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.939

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.280
ground they're just like so what I have

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.599

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.889
like whatever why'd you have a [ __ ]

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.210
kid it's just weird they're like they're

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.270
fighting themselves and to be like yeah

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.379
I just want to have kids and chill it

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.900
they've been brainwashed yeah so that's

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.129
what i was reaiiy read a blows it go

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.539
short book but it's all it goes through

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.490
like the myth of psyche and aphrodite it

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.189
shows like through the myth what women

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:26.750
like face mentally like what their

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.800
challenges are yeah

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.360
there's weird it's very straight you try

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.400
to read it it's like it makes sense

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.659
because it barely makes sense you know I

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:33.740
mean you read any like damn this is

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.349
[ __ ] confusing a [ __ ] but that's the

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:37.580
robbery that's why I've read this week

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.650
that's my weekly read it's a good read

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.779
it's tight I hope you don't adjust this

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:43.339
but it was uh it was like you know what

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.620
it's pretty cool that's pretty tight but

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.270
it was 22 because these guys wrote this

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.339
[ __ ] and like I get I'm like dude the

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:51.259
fact that this dude wrote the this book

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:52.610
on woman's psychology must have been

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.139
getting pilloried by people we must have

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.960
been killed yeah thank you thank you now

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.779
do you think you faking you an idea it's

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:01.939
like yes yeah it's funny you can

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:04.669
psychoanalyze any dude on earth mmm and

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.229
no dude on earth a big you think you

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.719
[ __ ] know me you think you can tell

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:13.729
me what to [ __ ] do are you being a

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:14.210
[ __ ]

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.169
well that's the other thing too in a

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.330
relationship just the way it plays out

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.620
it I think you've said this before if

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.839
like you've definitely said this before

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.389
it's like you know in like two like it

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:24.830
introduced a girl to your family they

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.439
want to be like she have a job yeah she

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:29.089
better or she's not working like it's

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:31.279
just they're not under that pressure no

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:33.199
they don't need to be cuz it doesn't

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.550
make sense to be yeah it's like like

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.050
your dad is your kid suckling

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.550
from your like hold a baby I go to

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.840
[ __ ] take this call right it just

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.190
doesn't make it just yeah

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.080
nonsensical it's not like saying like

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.699
you should be banned to like chained to

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:50.060
your [ __ ] stove but it's like I was

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.190
crapping out a baby I'd probably dig I

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.720
let me think about what I should do

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.310
it's you know it's a fun there's a

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.900
[ __ ] up take I get it it's not that

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.280
[ __ ] up but I just don't have anything

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.870
that it's [ __ ] not that's the thing

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.030
it's not [ __ ] up I get why people are

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.539
like you know I did you know I I see the

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:07.280
bad side of it I do but at the same time

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.229
it's like it's just a it's just a

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:10.970
generalization I can't crap out a baby

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:11.419
bro

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:13.219
suits the generalizations don't have

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:15.590
there's obviously outliers to this sure

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.870
there are women that are career driven

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.389
obviously yeah you know they're black

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:21.860
chicks that can dunk in the WNBA

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.650
together some like one

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.569
I think cameras Ellen's could throw down

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:28.729
nah she could dunk yeah there's always

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:30.860
can dunk I think so the [ __ ] black

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.240
conservatives know i got that rock

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.940

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.849
mean yeah if camera zones donc to the

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:50.690
left would implode there'd be the most

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.370
ultra powerful woman ever so Candace

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.710

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.580

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.190
well how tall is she cuz I mean she can

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:10.250

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:22.669
a pair dudes that we're doing like

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:23.930
throwing it off the backboard and doing

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.090
a 360 and the girl and one girl would go

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.460

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:09.560
haircut not even cut through the fired

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.960
house barks I got like into this

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.240
wormhole about Rachel Dolezal the other

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.190
day yeah how she's the best

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.290
dude miles yeah but I mean my whole

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.910
thing is that like she gets laughed at

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.130
by like the most lib of liberals will be

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.620
like oh my give you bring up Dolezal

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.810
they're like oh my god please that's

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:27.980
ridiculous you know when they're you

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.410
know what they're like take against why

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.790
you should be able to laugh at ever

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.040
trying to change races no their

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.480
reasoning no why because it's a

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.400
privilege because a white person can

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.750
more easily fake black although it's

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.760
kind of offensive I think I was thinking

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.650
about transiting myself you should try

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.110
my trans racially yeah so it's like she

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.180
so you're just gonna go blackface 24/7

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.150
well that was just straight like not

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.670
even not even brown just thick black

00:09:55.670 --> 00:10:01.070
makeup on your face it was like it is

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.140
[ __ ] up because it's like so the whole

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.430
story I think I said this before that

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.200
was like the whole story is like a she

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.760
claims to be of getting like molested by

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.290
her family her religious family and they

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.430
were getting like severely her and her

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:11.810
adopted black siblings were getting

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.850
molested and severely beaten yeah and

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.620
when she came out that's when her

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.270
parents were like scooby Doo they're

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.100
like now she's [ __ ] away Rip's Esther

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.590
she like this traumatic childhood who

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.140
like any other like liberal minded

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.790
person would be like oh my god that's

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.100
horrible but she dealt with it by like

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.670
mildly black facing that was her [ __ ]

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.900
just sick way to handle those her happy

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.670
thought she was just like dude I wish

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.410
everybody that got PTSD just did

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.320
blackface instead of all our troops

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.190
committing suicide sick would it be if

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.240
all our troops just went in full

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.680
blackface you just see a dude walking

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.460
around the mall

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.860
it's the thick black face on man Jack

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.700
damn we lost another truth he's got PTSD

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.530
salute dudes black me thank you for your

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.050
service rep they need steel valor by

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.940
doing blackface you could go get a free

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.620
auntie anne's present

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.390
earn that some other dude in blackface

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.950
would call you out back yeah

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:10.190
what squad are you with dudes

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:19.630
tap-dancing blackface at each other she

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.490
solved her traumatic childhood by mild

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.350
blackface and then like did all this

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.590
lament for black civil rights a clerk at

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.860
a black community yeah full like like

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.060
you know the weirdest thing in the world

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.330
but it's so weird for someone to be like

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.620
did you just even like - like if you

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.560
trying to question a well even by that

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.590
logic of like it's easier for a white

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.660
person to trans black which is like not

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.400
tellin - soso dude don't let the old

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.000
Sammy Sosa dude if I were to try to

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.100
chant trans the black it wouldn't be

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.500
easy but it would dude why is that white

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.120
guy like I know easily be a caught in

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.800
blackface so it's like there's a small

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.270
percentage of people who can kind of

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.360
like sneakily do this but by that logic

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.170
it's easier for women to trans demanding

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.880
haircut and then go to Target and buy

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.860
some dungarees dude it's like you're a

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.960
[ __ ] dude for a guy you got to get

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.360
like [ __ ] tits you gotta like take

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.010
you know the trans to a black woman you

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.600
mean no no it's easy I'm talking about

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.680
just men and women now Dolezal can't

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.510
racially trans because it's privileged

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.250
on her PI here yeah but it's in that

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.660
level it's like all right well as a man

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.580
it's harder for me to translate become a

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.830
woman dude it's so much harder yeah but

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.760
like I you know and as a girl it's like

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.040
dungarees pocket tee baggy t-shirt shut

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.080
cut the hair off shave your head get a

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.420
nice baseball I [ __ ] in dude yeah I

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.130
mean you know you could take hormones

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.390
you get Jack at that point you're just

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.950
being a pig like you're wheat

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.710
hanging out your mouth become a cowboy

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.170
didn't take hormones - yeah the trans

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.450
but it's like kind of juicing bro

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:59.570
can Jack take now I'm threatened good

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.520

[ __ ] it you're gonna [ __ ] it be me so

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.890
you're afraid of trans men yeah women

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.600
that have transgender men taking

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.950

but he's wearing like women's clothing

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.210

more likely to kill yourself not it

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.890
might be like four but if you start

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.140
taking hormones you know they always say

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.970

like like the onion people take like

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.220
SSRIs and there was that study where

them who were they trying to concentrate

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.880
on they took out like they controlled

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.620
the Pacific they controlled like

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.570
everything yeah all of their neighbors

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.910

just murder and every but the episode

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.250
part two is like talking about the

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.450
discrepancies between reporting like

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.779
because Japan won't really acknowledge

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:27.090
the atrocities they committed like they

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.159
don't really teach that in school fair

00:26:29.159 --> 00:26:29.929
enough

00:26:29.929 --> 00:26:32.220
yeah kind of acknowledge it we didn't

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.659
did we really cooled off on it when I

00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:34.679
was in grade school or grade school

00:26:34.679 --> 00:26:36.599
history I learned about the basket of

00:26:36.599 --> 00:26:39.450
fruit Indians chilling with early but

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.460
then once you hit like high school it

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.840
was like hey you guys want to learn

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.369
about slavery again in history class

00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:45.389
because that's the only thing we're

00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:46.349
going to talk about till you graduate

00:26:46.349 --> 00:26:51.809
college we just talked about like yeah

00:26:51.809 --> 00:26:56.729
we got hit especially in college it's

00:26:56.729 --> 00:26:57.869
just like hey you guys wanna hear about

00:26:57.869 --> 00:27:00.389
slavery or American Indians genocide

00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:02.669
which one do you want to hear how about

00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:05.549
us doing cool [ __ ] us [ __ ] off the

00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:08.059
Indians were sick I stand by that one I

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:12.359
talked to a guy there's a conspiracy out

00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:13.289
there that like the Indians were

00:27:13.289 --> 00:27:15.869
actually black and that like black

00:27:15.869 --> 00:27:17.849
American was that black people in theory

00:27:17.849 --> 00:27:19.769
yeah it was like it was like the Indians

00:27:19.769 --> 00:27:22.470
are black and they were they were black

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.669
and like eating

00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:25.799
we never genocided the Indians they just

00:27:25.799 --> 00:27:27.539
[ __ ] like got enslaved in the morph

00:27:27.539 --> 00:27:30.690
into slavery like disappeared well black

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.059
black history theories are probably my

00:27:33.059 --> 00:27:35.580
least favorite was the best black it

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.049
were actually just black [ __ ]

00:27:37.049 --> 00:27:39.090
Israelites I loved out of this world

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.440
well it's definitely their whole thing

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.899
is like how are all these people who are

00:27:42.899 --> 00:27:44.549
like saying they're like the Semitic

00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:45.509
Jewish people how are they so

00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:47.609
fair-skinned when in reality like they

00:27:47.609 --> 00:27:49.940
were in the [ __ ] Middle East

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.539
so they're the black have you seen lives

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:56.129
yeah Arabs can be pretty light-skinned

00:27:56.129 --> 00:27:57.269
yeah but I'm saying like they're talking

00:27:57.269 --> 00:28:00.809
about the og Jesus level yeah like it's

00:28:00.809 --> 00:28:02.220
still Arabs or they're coming later time

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.679
and David those dudes were [ __ ] rock

00:28:04.679 --> 00:28:06.539
those dudes were rocking some [ __ ]

00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:10.590
very dark-skinned I or they were like

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:15.269
light-skinned it depends where Jesus

00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:16.979
Israel Israel they were if they were

00:28:16.979 --> 00:28:17.789
getting sun-baked

00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:19.499
I don't know like in northern Iraq like

00:28:19.499 --> 00:28:21.570
tril Iran there's a lot of white guys

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.729
this whole thing was Afghanistan's all

00:28:23.729 --> 00:28:24.149
white

00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:25.559
I know Afghanistan it's very far from

00:28:25.559 --> 00:28:27.389
Jesus Ville but it's still like Arabic

00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:30.499
is you can be pretty white can you yeah

00:28:30.499 --> 00:28:32.489
he was on the bus and this guy

00:28:32.489 --> 00:28:33.929
confronted another like it's Jewish

00:28:33.929 --> 00:28:35.549
definitely not black because this guy

00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:36.899
was saying like black is realizing

00:28:36.899 --> 00:28:37.860
Jewish guy was like

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.299

00:28:45.929 --> 00:28:47.250
like we're [ __ ] Jewish and this black

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.049

00:28:49.049 --> 00:28:54.090
users like I mean the how white the Jew

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:56.130

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.490

deep in the Middle East I don't know it

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.880

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:48.880
yeah you told me that was shit-faced and

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.560
no one really said that maybe they

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.210

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.640
shit-faced I was like I have yeah just

00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:00.850

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:02.580
the kids called me a [ __ ]

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.289
yeah it was tough Allah called me a

00:33:04.289 --> 00:33:05.880
[ __ ] and then called my car piece of

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.890
[ __ ] really that was like that house was

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:10.590
like a rotating there was like two main

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:11.700
ladies and then there was like a

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.039
rotating swap of like it's always

00:33:14.039 --> 00:33:16.799
jarring for a white person to when you

00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:19.769
walk into a black house yeah it's a

00:33:19.769 --> 00:33:21.480
totally different it like it's different

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.070
cuz you only hang out Moses you only

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.470
hang out with white people sure you I'm

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.240
only in white houses for the most part

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.250
but then when you walk in like a black

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:30.690
where is this house like whoa what the

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.309
[ __ ] is going on why do you have stuffed

00:33:32.309 --> 00:33:35.970
animals an aquarium you guys are old

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:38.880
it's also too like in this area

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.490
especially in Delaware County there's no

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:42.809
black suburbs there's no black

00:33:42.809 --> 00:33:43.350
middle-class

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.090
yes it's very the black middle class is

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:47.190
like lower or black middle class so when

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:48.600
I went to New Jersey I moved into a

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.510
black suburb and I was like what the

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.100
[ __ ] this is [ __ ] crazy

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.230
and then like I've been in upper-class

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:56.730
black homes and you just walk in it's

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.440
like it's like like it upper middle

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.870
class white place sure absolutely but

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:02.820
when you said that dude when I went into

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.289
like help my neighbors and I first moved

00:34:04.289 --> 00:34:05.519
to Philly and I'm in like West Philly

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:07.409
the first time I walked in this old

00:34:07.409 --> 00:34:09.419

00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:12.750

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:27.270
like telling me about someone being

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:29.490
addicted decay - yeah dude it's like and

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:31.860
I was like synthetic weed they're

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.480
addicted to synthetic weed right now cuz

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.920
they're spraying it with fentanyl yeah

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.290
and there's like yeah well then we're

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:40.320
also doing - is with what people think

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.670
is like I think it said this before but

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:43.710
with coke and percocets are doing

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:45.270
they're mixing it with ketamine and

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.690
fentanyl

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:48.240
so like you get like that like little

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.220
Dobby thought out in like ketamine's

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.780
kind of ketamine suppose like the only

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.530
addictive hallucinogen Oh

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:56.670
ketamine it's called hippie heroin it's

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:57.450
a disassociative

00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:58.410
didn't even know that what's

00:45:58.410 --> 00:45:59.970
disassociative you disassociate with

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.280
your you don't you're going this you

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.420
ever watch someone with ketamine their

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:04.830
body shuts down they can I don't like a

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:06.600
weird Crouch position it's almost like a

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.150
nod and then you go into this like you

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.130
have like an out-of-body experience

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.270
where you're just kind of like trapped

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.500
in your mind and it's like some people

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.460
will [ __ ] love it

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.290
one of my friends did it and he was just

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:18.900
like I just was like unable to move and

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.610
trapped in this weird mental space like

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:21.660
all I could think about was all

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:22.859
the bad stuff that ever happened to me

00:46:22.859 --> 00:46:25.230
oh my god it's like me going to sleep to

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:30.059
be honest what I say that skull might be

00:46:30.059 --> 00:46:32.010
[ __ ] hit you with some [ __ ]

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:35.849
poppies lace in my skull is down in

00:46:35.849 --> 00:46:39.660
[ __ ] poppies down in Nashville lace

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.940
in my [ __ ] skull with [ __ ]

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:47.400
fentanyl just a papi bodega down in

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:57.599
Nashville Tennessee don't what fentanyl

00:46:57.599 --> 00:46:59.760
the early ketamine in low doses is like

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.299
super effective with depression and you

00:47:03.299 --> 00:47:04.950
know so they're like trying to work out

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:06.299
apparently it works really well but if

00:47:06.299 --> 00:47:07.740
you go into like a k-hole if you take

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.720
too much ketamine you go into a k-hole

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:11.970
apparently it's like real [ __ ] up yeah

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:13.740
real dark yeah that sucks

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.839
but apparently is AK addicting too so

00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:17.549
then like you have to snort a ton of it

00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:20.190
okay that I was gonna say alcohol I get

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:24.230
pretty dark but it's usually really fun

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:27.829
[Laughter]

00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:30.480
blackout if you went to a blacked out

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.339
state and retained all your memories and

00:47:32.339 --> 00:47:34.410
came out of crazies like oh god that's

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:35.730
what it was I mean I didn't black out

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:37.349
but that I that's what I thought was

00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:39.299
weird about when I took ecstasy like I

00:47:39.299 --> 00:47:41.400
was barely conscious yeah like I could

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.339
think clearly I was totally fine but I

00:47:44.339 --> 00:47:46.710
just the release of all the [ __ ]

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:48.000
endorphins and all that shows it's like

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.859
oh my god this is crazy

00:47:49.859 --> 00:47:52.020
yeah it's weird to be conscious and

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.210
[ __ ] up yeah for you know I mean I

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:56.069
mean that's what doing like a bunch of

00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:57.000
mushrooms and [ __ ] is

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.339
yeah it's like you well you're not even

00:47:59.339 --> 00:48:01.230
fully conscious the filter that usually

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:03.539
scrubs out all this sensory data it's

00:48:03.539 --> 00:48:04.890
just like alright we'll take five and

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:07.770
you're like yeah but you can also have

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:09.359
you do enough you just you're just like

00:48:09.359 --> 00:48:10.020
this is awesome

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.559
yeah the I would say coke is obviously

00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:15.779
the same yeah you're thinking very

00:48:15.779 --> 00:48:17.490
clearly but you I've only taken it

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:20.760
really when I'm shit-faced coke to get

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.329
real quiet

00:48:21.329 --> 00:48:22.619
there's a small percentage of people to

00:48:22.619 --> 00:48:24.210
do coke yeah I do that something there's

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:26.730
kind of like yeah he's chillin yeah real

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:28.829
reserves yeah I would have a horrible

00:48:28.829 --> 00:48:32.010
time and I would panic and freak out no

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:33.990
you want my heart would beat weird yeah

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:35.520
definitely would it's not

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.850
that I'm saying from here but you may be

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:40.440
a maybe on the comedown but while you're

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.180
on it you would not panic or feel bad

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.860
true you while you're taking it you'd be

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.680
like this is the [ __ ] best [ __ ]

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.080
myself I can totally do cocaine

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:52.800
yeah but then then the next morning

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.300
you'll be like I've never done cocaine

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.280
and that's [ __ ] this is embarrassing

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.490
why would I do cocaine [ __ ] am i that is

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:01.170
a funny [ __ ] thing that's a funny

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:03.210
especially for you in general to be like

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:04.950
as most people just be like but it'd be

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:09.150
like [ __ ] am i who do I think I am just

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:10.950
small-town mentality like what do you

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:14.010

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.940
sensory data part cigar taking off like

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.500
