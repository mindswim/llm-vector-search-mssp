00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.599
helium comedy club calm for tickets I

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.400
bought him on Twitter at Shane and

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.430
McGillis I'm going to try to explain to

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.000
Shane why Georgia losing again has

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.550
completely destroyed notre dame's season

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.369
it would have been much better for Notre

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.019
Dame because everyone was like wow they

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.519
lost but not by much

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.969
no yeah well it didn't help that USC

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.399
kind of sucks Michigan sucks Stanford

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.020
sucks all these teams that are

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.480
traditionally okay or at least pretty

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.120
Ely you know that kind of that kind of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.590
sinks Notre Dame's chances at the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.390
playoffs it's better not to have them

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.770
get to the playoffs anyway because

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.329
they're just going to hurt your feelings

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.270
again like they do all these years yeah

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.309
yeah yeah they're not there it's just

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.190
Ohio State Clemson and Alabama now

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.570
Oklahoma a little bit but there's no one

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.850
else you became a Notre Dame fan because

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.680
you grew up a Catholic kid right yeah my

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.019
grandpa played there oh we did my cousin

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.330
played there Wow yes impressive yeah

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.740
when did your grandfather play what

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.210
years didn't remember he's he played in

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.549
like the 30s I think wow that far back

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.590
yeah you got his pretty funny story I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.900
all the stories I had about my grandpa

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.820
was that it was just a [ __ ] lunatic

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.890
like every story they ever told me was

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.070
just him fighting people right and he

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.100
died when my dad was like 13 my dad was

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.689
like the youngest of like six or seven

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.990
and all the stories were like that and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.670
then recently I just found a newspaper

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.549
clipping of him at Notre Dame when he

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.110
was playing and he was it was just a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.579
newspaper clipping saying why he was

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.710
being held out against Purdue that was

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.290
which was because of a head injury and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.329
he held out because of a head injury in

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.200
1913 right yet CTE like the way he died

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.479
was his he had a heart attack and then

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.399
he was getting surgery and when he woke

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.409
up out of the anesthesia he tried to

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.020
fight the people around him his [ __ ]

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.369
heart exploded that's what a loved one

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.099
out there same way that he lived his

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.920
life did when he he died doing what he

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.519
loved fighting

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.609
for no reason yeah uh you're wearing a

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.239
fighter on your own ideas man yeah Nate

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.799

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.260
now I saw you last night I think we're

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.150
both at the stand tonight oh and it was

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.540
very funny seeing you in a situation

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.579
that you're like um trying some new

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.400
material and you guys see that you're

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.829
not that kind of audience but I'm still

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.810
going through with it always the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.689
funniest thing yeah it was it was funny

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.189
because the first show all that new

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.959
stuff were killed right and I was like

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.790
yeah you know how you feel when you get

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.530
like a new bit I'm like all [ __ ] is

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.019
gonna be great dude I literally because

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.470
I was on earlier you in that first show

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.659
I did I'm trying to do all this stuff

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.340
for the creeps with kids too I'm like oh

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.680
[ __ ] I need more kids stuff yeah and I'm

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.519
doing it I'm like I'm really [ __ ]

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.040
great great you know because it was just

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.889
a great audience and then the second

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.959
audio and you gotta understand they're

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.669
smaller there weren't people in the

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.409
front row and all you don't mean like

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.840
they were all tight but I came on after

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.609
you and just started torturing them I'm

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.829
like I'm not [ __ ] giving them

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.959
anything that I feel good about four

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.810
minutes ago yeah I did and I regretted

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.769
it yeah but I thought that voice that

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.930
you're doing was hysterical more things

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.639
sooner this southerners yeah I mean if

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:38.900
you wait anybody that watches that

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.449
remembers that guy it's uh Ken Burns

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.310
Civil War documentary it was just the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.889
southern guy that's just clearly [ __ ]

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.549
line this historian that only gives

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.479
quotes from 18 to the 1860s and there's

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.340
always like in the middle of a battle

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.900
he's like then he turned to him and he

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.479
said boy they're really giving us a

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:05.269
licking right I hate when even people do

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.099
that in their own lives over they'll go

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.979
back and remember a conversation for

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:11.840
like 20 years ago I don't remember

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.949
people I [ __ ] date it like I've said

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:19.190
to people are you sure and she's like

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.229
ass in my ass you don't remember yes

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.680
y-yeah I recorded

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.259
yeah you know that comes back to [ __ ]

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.940
haunt you oh yeah yeah that's smart

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.650
that's smart

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.110
let's see your a recorded generation oh

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.530
yeah you're one of everything that went

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.139
down with you is going to happen to

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.680
anybody

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.960
there's not many new people that have

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.600
podcasts yeah so I think that that is

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.850
gonna probably be a pretty regular thing

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.979
but I you know most of the people that

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.289
are getting stuff that are in my my

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.990
class or generation yeah I'm sure

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.600
they're shits pretty [ __ ] safe you

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.419
know yeah they nobody that does I don't

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.590
know there's not a lot of like dudes

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.360
that listen like ona and start like all

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.830
that [ __ ] coming through the pipes

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.870
anymore right basically like they've

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.729
already been raised not to do they're

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.400
like soft [ __ ] yeah yeah what time did

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.020
you grow up in PA I grew up in

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.940
Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania okay that's

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.020
where that's like 20 minutes west of

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.510
Harrisburg okay so you're in a deer

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.270
hunting town yeah except I wasn't I was

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.220
I didn't really get into it that much

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.919
but yes that kind of thing for sure

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.830
and I think that's the the fact that

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.650
people don't understand that kind of

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.470
mentality to begin with you know I mean

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.650
like when you grow up in a place and I

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.900
always thought that the Rocky movie was

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.510
perfect in the first one where everybody

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.699
said you can't do it rock you're going

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.280
the way that I grew up so you're going

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.680
to be a little more tilted towards

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.169
gallows your first straight out for sure

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.599
I mean that was it's funny this guy

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.460
I remember being drunk at a party and my

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.560
cousin was like I my my cousin's a

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.510
comedian he's gonna find this drunk dude

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.220
I wasn't gonna be on [ __ ] Saturday

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.659
night that was literally like eight

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:14.639
years ago and as soon as I knew I was

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.229
getting it I called my cousin's I tell

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.190
that [ __ ] actually you hold more

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.990
than that

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.300
but yeah that's that's definitely like

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.039
people who people are [ __ ] definitely

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:27.979
delighted that this happened I'm sure

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.550
because it makes them feel okay about

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.380
why this is all that's gonna happen

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.169
yes why try [ __ ] that's literally the

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:37.710
way

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.980
I grew up why try why dream and you know

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.500

different generations of the same I came

in I so you say the audience you know

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.520
basically you're not a good audience and

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.500
I'm like just like sitting there go [ __ ]

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:10.170

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.870
that [ __ ] that chunk from you Yeah right

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.700
here you see people just arms cross

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.860
staring at you like I'm a [ __ ] idiot

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.500
why would I think that was funny yeah I

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.070
think it's always funny to like you

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.610
could see people no matter how long

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.380
they've been doing this and there's

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.360
you'll still see flopsweat you know I

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.750
mean see that moment of it looks like

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.460
you just saw someone get punched in the

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.800
face and their eyes open up and they're

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.450
looking around they're not quite there

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.200
and it's always funny to everybody else

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.030
yeah I mean all the other I'm so happy

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.340
when I see another comedian bomb yeah I

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.200
mean at this point that's really the

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.580
only thing that I don't really want to

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.930
send someone else [ __ ] kill [ __ ]

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:13.410
eat it

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.940
I remember when I was younger there was

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.170
a guy who has decided to mentor me a

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.180
little bit and he'd be around he goes

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.680

to do some time on a show that he wasn't

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.160
scheduled for and he [ __ ] ate it I

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.900
mean he just ate it this guy was like

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.060
way years and years and years ahead of

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.030
me in the business and then I went up

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.920
and I'm crushing and I look up at him

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.480
and I'm like you know this guy who's

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.730
been kind of giving me tips he's gonna

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.520
look so happy you know and I just saw

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:09.720
[ __ ] flare it doesn't feel good from

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.600
me it was like the first time that you

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.820
ever got a shot off your you know over

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.440
your dad's head or your older brothers

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.670
you know and then the Bogue yes teaching

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.000
me to play this game that's always funny

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.370
though but it is you know I notice that

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.170
you seem to have gone through all the

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.880
[ __ ] that happened with you you kind of

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.810
holding it together is it still I mean

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.370
it definitely stings like everyone so

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.410
everyone smile because it does seem

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.420
[ __ ] surreal I think I never thought

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.160
I was gonna get Saturday live right I

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.350
never like didn't really [ __ ] I

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.210
wasn't aiming for that right I knew

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.920
there's no way I would ever [ __ ] get

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:57.120
that yeah just you know waiting and then

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.440
yeah but everyone smell like I'll be in

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.360
the shower and just be like holy [ __ ] I

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.339
got it I was on sex look I got Saturday

00:10:02.339 --> 00:10:04.589
why that's happening crazy yeah so

00:10:04.589 --> 00:10:07.530
everyone's one that I am and then I'd

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.390
say the things that I don't care that

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.150
like normal people seeing those articles

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.100
and seeing those headlines and like the

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.930
quotes and [ __ ] normal people being

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.210
appalled by it I get like I'm not upset

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.589
with anybody that's like hey [ __ ] you

00:10:19.589 --> 00:10:21.660
racist yeah all right I get it

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.670
I'd you know but when it's coming from

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.930
comics and not like not like whoa comics

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.310
or whatever like I understand that's

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.350
your [ __ ] brand you need to condemn

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.450
me that it'll help your [ __ ] black

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.280
box theater you'll get you know yeah but

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.230
it's the comics that also do the

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.940
podcasts and the radio and all that

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.070
stuff that's where I'm like you don't

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.510
think I could get a [ __ ] clip of you

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.870
out of context yeah but is that you know

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.540
or is it just there it's people that I

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.870
knew of and like had met yeah for sure

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.260
yeah that's just like I don't know the

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.030
self-awareness of that is [ __ ] wild

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.670
it is it uh you know cuz literally I

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.920
grew up in the [ __ ] shot Chuck air

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.090
it's how I made my [ __ ] money and

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.190
you know that stuff would go into the

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.600
newspapers and then you would be

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.610
laughing and [ __ ] but then you'd have

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.700
like an in while say something like you

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:18.490
see him [ __ ] around but none of that

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.970
stuff I mean when I think back to this

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:26.110
[ __ ] that was okay to say I get that

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.390
life has moved along

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.300
shouldn't we all get that life has moved

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.780
on my initial thing with you was all

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.060
right let's judge him when he gets this

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.490
iron out life when he [ __ ] you know

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.980
plays in Yankee Stadium is he's still

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.380
gonna be playing like a [ __ ] triple-a

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.870
guy or is he gonna move up and the one

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.240
guy that could have you know made you

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.130
see maybe even things definitely would

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.810
have been lon there's the guy who picked

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.600
you the guy who shapes this stuff and

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.470
that's the frustrating thing about this

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.940
in yeah I think his hands were

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.830
definitely tied I don't think he could

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.660
have I think there was enough with like

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.030
advertising in the hosts right [ __ ] like

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.710
that where it was and I mean the staff

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.570
there the writers stuff like that there

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.680
was enough people there that were like

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.660
no I don't feel comfortable with him I

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.080
don't feel comfortable so [ __ ] we

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.880
agree but yeah yeah for sure

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.070
I mean I have plenty if I can guess to

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.940
do this show that a piece of [ __ ] you

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.440
know I mean like you've loaned most of

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.970
them you find out later

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.400
you know people they've been outed for

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.840

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.340

defending myself but let everybody yeah

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.390
right yeah just like when Cuomo was

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.070

not what we're working towards doing a

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:54.970
1989 joke so but as it helped you in the

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.320
club thing it always it brought more

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.930
attention to you I mean yeah yeah for

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:02.710

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.870
of makes stand-up weird cuz now I feel

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.730
like I have to address it right away

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.950
yeah cuz there's people I can see when I

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.330
get on stage people in the audience like

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.620

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.450
onstage as far as just talking right

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:20.980

except for when you're there and then

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.680
it's common as the only unique thing is

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.690
the people who decide to do something

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.540

nothing he and I have both had zero

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.870
growth maturity so except for I do this

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.970
I have a microphone that's it yeah yeah

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.160
I was my my girlfriend was making fun

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.780
she was like you're an eighth grader

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.700
yeah you're just

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.670
still an eighth-grader yeah because

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.270
that's where that was formed for you you

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.850
know like and I was talking to Jessica

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.580
Kirsten about this I go you know the

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.400
comedy nerds that their thing is oh I'm

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.370
gonna already you know I'm gonna [ __ ]

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.590
study this person study that but

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.260
naturally funny people they go up in the

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.030
open mikes is surprising to them because

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.130
you're like hey I am [ __ ] funny I

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.350
mean whatever it proved it but a couple

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.580
of those things where the people are

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.870
like well you're not professionally

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.180
funny yet and you go through this whole

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.250
thing to just go back to be that same

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.650
guy in the 8th grade that's what you

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.990
attempt to do with it yeah you know yeah

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.610
I think in eighth grade you found out

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.800
what was funny and then in like you know

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.420
the older you get you just saw people

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.510
slowly faking to be something else right

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.210
you just well the whole system the whole

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.970
corporate citizen jerking off so hold

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.220
the whole corporate system is to lie

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.590
that's how you get ahead that's how you

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.200
keep your job people are like well we're

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.820
coming from outside of the box and

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.790
you're just like okay this is

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:53.040
conversation that we're all having yeah

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.860
I think I would have struggled with that

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.180
with SNL I would have struggled with

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.330
that yeah the the the office the [ __ ]

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.340
right is working right yeah

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.930
I mean that's why I kind of got into

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.550
this was so I'd made sure I never had to

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.530
[ __ ] work I know that was the big

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.900
[ __ ] fear right actually working for

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.760
a living you know that was the big fear

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.520
that you tried to fight off by doing

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.140
something weird I mean still even the

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.350
idea of committing for eight ten dollars

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.930
a day just it makes me want to puke yeah

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.270
there are times I miss it though yeah

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.640
like I used to like I sold cars it was

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.940
nice I go back and do that oh nice

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.400

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.670
two years after college no were used no

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.490

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.300
hard to write yeah it was great how much

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.340
units I forget what it was it wasn't

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.080
like so that was another thing it was

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.310
nice about it cuz I could just tell him

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.560
I'd be like hey this is I'm gonna get

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.820
paid the same no matter how much you pay

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.470

that the [ __ ] old ladies out behind

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.170
you know if there was a pills one pill

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.510
would show up back in so he was having a

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:07.030
great [ __ ] time so he's driving down

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.120

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.830

Street smashes and tanks go out right

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.490
and they [ __ ] hit the street and

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.830
start to like freeze and people were

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.890
like black icing out right so they're

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.490
smashing me and my old man were watching

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.770
the TV and this thing of man and the

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.620
lighter side of the news ice in the

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.460
middle of July

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.740
Thanks playing the whole story his name

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.770
and I'm watching the [ __ ] TV and I

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.990
just feel the hot eyes I look over my

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.630
dad just [ __ ] glaring at me I'm like

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:05.740
back to this is I try to get back to

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.740
finding out what exactly happened you

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.510
crazy world yeah crazy world

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:15.529
nice shade girls in studio shades

00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:17.360
performing at helium comedy club in

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.240
Philly October 24th to 26th helium

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.490
comedy dot-com for tickets polishing on

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.250
Twitter at Shane and McGillis any the

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.750
clubs give you any shooter they just

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.779
think neuro this yes really

00:22:29.779 --> 00:22:33.169
some of them initially like they I well

00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:34.220
that was another thing that sucked is

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.899
like because I I knew this was I was

00:22:35.899 --> 00:22:37.399
getting us now so like I kind of

00:22:37.399 --> 00:22:39.080
cancelled some [ __ ] dates right and

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.140
then like the press came out was like

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.809
these clubs cancelled him right that was

00:22:44.809 --> 00:22:47.389
kind of [ __ ] annoying but I know some

00:22:47.389 --> 00:22:49.940
of them did some of them were like we

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.200
don't want that right now well either

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.350
reschedule or just not do it really

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.610
that's surprising to me because

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.549
everything just the opposite you know

00:22:57.549 --> 00:23:00.380
yeah I guess something immediate because

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.210
I mean this is like weeka this would

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.010
have I would have already done the dance

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.850
so it was yeah I well you know the media

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:09.620
always gets that kind of thing wrong too

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.370
because they're like Louie CK is trying

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.799
to restart or kickstart his crazy like

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:18.440
Jodi he's done you have no [ __ ] idea

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.470
the drawing ability of this guy you know

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.510
he's choosing where he wants the play

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.039
he's choosing where he wants to sell out

00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:26.899
yeah over and over and over aggress

00:23:26.899 --> 00:23:30.980
whatever he wants yeah did I I know I

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.360
talked to you when all this [ __ ] was

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.549
going then did any other comics talk to

00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:37.909
you people had been through stuff with

00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:41.169
people who hadn't been through stuff

00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:44.570
went to because what but that was always

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.340
the thing is I always thought that more

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.500
people who had been around a little

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.059
while should have been heard from not

00:23:50.059 --> 00:23:52.639
just the angry people but people who

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:55.010
could have said anything I'm I'm being

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.010
taken out of context is a problem and I

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.340
went through you know years where I was

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.950
absolutely wrong about stuff in my

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.220
career you know me wrong for years at a

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:07.610
time

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.549
and that's the whole growth thing that's

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:13.789
what you do also when I was talking to

00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:16.820
Colin Quinn one day and he said to me he

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.419
goes why do they say punching down we're

00:24:20.419 --> 00:24:24.400
not punching it's slapping it Batman

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.050
because a comedian has never changed

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.930
anything and it when I was thinking

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.420
about going it is [ __ ] true that

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.380
somehow we expect things out of George

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.620
Carlin but what the karlon change in the

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.630
world you know yeah only the people who

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.100
kind of greed with him yeah that was

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.600
that was kind of brutal the karlon

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.310
things yeah for a minute people were

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.410
just bringing up clips of Carlin and

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.020
both sides either pro or against me

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.430
we're arguing that they were like

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:55.850
somehow vindicating me or condemning me

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:57.230
and it's right shut the [ __ ] up

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:01.160
yeah he's not just for Laos I Thai guy

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.960
got fired let's move on

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.310
right it was like I don't want to keep

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.260
talking like like we're talking about it

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.150
yeah sure but like I'm not gonna go on

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:12.680
like Twitter and be like oh please no

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.480
dude I only wanted to be a comedian and

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.130
I'll keep doing it the one thing I

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.470
regret the one thing I really regret was

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.870
saying I'm a comedian that pushes

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.410
boundaries right [ __ ] hurt yeah five

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.090
minutes after I posted that I was like

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.850
yeah [ __ ] yeah that's corny cuz you

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.500
never get up in the morning go how can i

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.920
push about what you're saying as you do

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.900
a little edge your material that was you

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.290
find it funny I die I'm not I don't have

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:42.320
remorse like over that I mean I do feel

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.360
bad about saying I'm a comedian that

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.680
pushes boundaries but I know where my

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.620
head was at when I wrote that very quick

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.440
[ __ ] well even when I saw you do that

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.240
when some people are like digit apology

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.010
is not apology I go that's because he

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:56.900
doesn't have a PR firm working for him

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.460
and it wasn't an apology

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.920
right I wasn't about yeah you were you

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.440
explained but normally when you're in a

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.260
position of that you have a team of

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.960
people who come in they kick things

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.230
around and I did have a team of people

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.450
telling me what to say yeah and I wasn't

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:15.860
gonna say you weren't gonna Dave

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.180
wouldn't you the guy wanted me to say

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.370
something different than what I said man

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.170
I was like I can't I can't do that

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.050
because first off if you guys are

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.750
getting me on this clip yeah ready

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.700
there's [ __ ] way worse out there

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.290
yeah I've been recording myself since I

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:33.410
started comedy as a [ __ ] open mic leg

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:34.940
you know I was an open mic comic

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.270
three years ago yeah

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.300
what I was so like I don't know if you

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.240
imagine the the feelings you had as an

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.650
open mic comic or when you're starting

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.450
comedy you're seeing other people get

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.670
opportunities and then you're sitting

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.560
there in the basement drunk be like a

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:56.530
[ __ ] gay comedy um oh yeah all that

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.110
dumb [ __ ] so then yeah I mean that's I

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:01.300
deleted a bunch of podcast episode it's

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.040
not because I was afraid of them finding

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.180
things it was just cuz I was like

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.700
embarrassed that I was a whiny [ __ ]

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.360
about comedy yeah if anybody listened to

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.460
the podcast which they didn't for like

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.150
three four years yeah there is an

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:18.700
evolution of me going from open mic

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.700
comic that resents people with success

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.650
because I was in a [ __ ] basement in

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.660
West Philly sure where I was recording

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.340
this like I lived on a mattress in

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:31.720
Westville with $0 so then as soon as I

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.120
moved to New York every I got every

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.220
single opportunity possible and then I

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.900
was like oh maybe it wasn't because I

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.660
was a [ __ ] straight white guy Yeah

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.340
right it was because I lived in a

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.200
[ __ ] basement in Philly yeah and of

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.820
course I'm not gonna get a [ __ ] agent

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.610
here yeah so that like and you can hear

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.460
me [ __ ] evolve in the podcast now

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.170
that I'm done but you know who are the

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.450
guys to help you come to New York

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.250
because like I said once you get to New

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:00.970
York seemed like everybody was you know

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.610
in your camp pretty quickly yeah I well

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.080
that's I waited as long as I could

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.130
because I really didn't want to live

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.180
here

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.850
I you know Sodor big J yeah boss uh

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:14.980
those guys for sure those kind of guys

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:19.270
and like I don't know whether people get

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.090
this or not but they literally have an I

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:23.680
in an ear for what's coming a lot of

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.110
people say oh it's who you know blah

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:28.570
blah blah but you seek out people that

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:30.190
you're like oh that's [ __ ] kids good

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:31.810
you know I mean he's not you know and

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.840
whoever I mean I've seen people I go

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.110
he's not ready yet for some of these

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.330
clubs but he's definitely going to be

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:41.950
like there's some times where you can

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.960
look at someone the audience doesn't

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.220
laugh and you're like this kid's gonna

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:49.360
run me over one day just a weird [ __ ]

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.620
thinker and that's what

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.600
you're really looking for somebody that

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.440
can find that thing in the middle of the

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.450
obvious he finds something that's not

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.059
obvious and sometimes is all it takes

00:29:01.059 --> 00:29:03.850
you know then you even say to people hey

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.890
you're not in hurry give it three years

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.059
well you don't want to hear that when

00:29:07.059 --> 00:29:10.090
you're centrist yeah yeah and then yeah

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:11.920
and then you you know again I would I

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.660
would go record an episode and be like

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.120
we'd be drunk after and open my shirt

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.490
just talking [ __ ] on anybody that got

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.640
anything yeah and but yeah I mean credit

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.580
to Sodor Sodor like his the people he

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.429
tries to have feature form or people

00:29:27.429 --> 00:29:30.130
yeah that will crush well yeah that will

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.820
put him in a hole and a lot of Nick

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.010
Mullen and hey we're like his last three

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:36.610
openers

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.490
yeah that's pretty like he he tries to

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.800
dig a hole for himself I remember the

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.890
last time we got in the conversation

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.390
like that and it was about you and he

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.130
does this [ __ ] kid he goes every time

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.530
I go up yeah man I'm [ __ ] I gotta

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.990
take extra steps but I think that's a

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.730
smart move to you know I mean when you

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.830
go out because people are gonna remember

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.809
the whole [ __ ] show unless thing you

00:29:58.809 --> 00:30:00.640
want them to think is this is a guy that

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.190
40 minutes stinks before he gets to the

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:05.620
stage you know I used to do that with my

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.290

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:19.540
[ __ ] believe love this and it really

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.850
makes me wonder where that money came

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.440
from for that Club I was in there last

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:30.500
night gun this is really big yeah it's a

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.080
huge space well even the upstairs club

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.240
would be in nice sized New York Club

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.980
yeah and that's just like hey if you

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.629
want to go in under 45 minutes that's

00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:41.000
the club that you could go into but you

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.100
go downstairs in like this is now the

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.070
old stand was so intimate and it really

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:49.220
did feel like this funky Clubhouse this

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.200
one feels a lot more professional you

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.780
know yeah yeah I like it though like

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.030

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.100
getting [ __ ] up over there that's been

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:05.150
a bit of a problem for me lights every

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.700

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.280

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.050

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.380
a big thick pizza you're like oh this

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.720

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.119

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.549
feelings being hurt I know that was very

00:35:34.549 --> 00:35:36.589
sad I lost a lot of sleep over that okay

00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:37.130
good

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:41.660
but anyway on a serious note a lot of

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.490
times since they started to this week

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:46.309
the Comedy Cellar show the comedian's

00:35:46.309 --> 00:35:49.880
will work out those given topics at new

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.890
joke night and one of the funny things

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:55.849
is almost every one of them says how

00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:57.829
stupid the topics are and how they're

00:35:57.829 --> 00:36:00.380
they're forced to oh my god I got to do

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.900
jokes about this Kim Kardashian or

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.819
whatever yeah I mean when you really

00:36:04.819 --> 00:36:07.779
think about it and somebody told me that

00:36:07.779 --> 00:36:10.099
ratings went up in the show and they

00:36:10.099 --> 00:36:11.869
expect to be invited back but when you

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:12.980
think about it you're gonna be stuck

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.190
into Trump or you know the Kardashians I

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.410
mean there's not too many things cuz if

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.999
you ever go said to the audience

00:36:19.999 --> 00:36:22.640
hey you see this thing in the news and

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.609

00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:39.349
always remember this to a lot of people

00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:41.450
just see the headline like there's been

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:44.059

00:36:44.059 --> 00:36:45.890
shock jock days and people be like hey

00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:53.180
positive yeah

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.309
and I I think one of the I'm pretty sure

00:37:08.989 --> 00:37:09.589
