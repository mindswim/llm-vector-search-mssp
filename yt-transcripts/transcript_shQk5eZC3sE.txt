00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.000
crazy so

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.079
the president of ukraine

00:35:12.079 --> 00:35:13.839
instead of joining the eu

00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:15.920
joined or like signed some eurasian [ __ ]

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.760
with yeah with with russia right him

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.440
with the swords of yours and then there

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.720
was a

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.599
there was the euro maidan protests yeah

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:25.680
which resulted in

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.599
uh

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:29.680
the president being outed

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.560
and they put in a more western friendly

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.839
leader

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:35.760
and i believe there were i remember when

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.560
it was happening there were some

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.720
rumblings of pretty clearly western

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.040
intelligence provoking the the riots a

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.560
little bit yeah now i'm not sure and i

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.960
would hate to be anti-american

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.760
uh but then putin went back into the

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.119
crimea and they

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:50.320
took that so they're like they're

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.599
starting to reinstall [ __ ] no they're

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:54.480
like no this is russia yeah we won yeah

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.400
enough of this crap

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.079
interesting

00:35:58.079 --> 00:36:00.400
and when they took the crimean peninsula

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.280
the

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.720
the whole army defected to russia

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.320
all the ukrainian military there like

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.400
laid down their arms and joined russia

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.760
yeah i heard there's a lot of boys in

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.599
ukraine that are fans a lot of the boys

00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:13.359
split pretty much yeah might be down the

00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:14.400
middle

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.160
yeah so we'll see i hope they don't go

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.440
to war that would be a real [ __ ]

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.320
bummer

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.720
i mean ukraine can't fight russia yeah

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.040
but that's the thing they would have us

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.440
true and allies oh i mean biden was

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.440
pretty explicit he was like we're not

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.800
they were like if you're american leave

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.079

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.640
true dude um

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.640
yeah we were uh the one thing that was

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.920
cool from that book they were talking

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.800
about

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.599
just how people used to have children

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:44.800
back in the day

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.160
and it was like a full economic blessing

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.440
like they were built into your wealth

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.520
the more kids you had the richer you

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.240
were yes and it was like it was it was

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.240
really taking a little dowry yeah going

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.760
oh it was just for the because you would

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.520
have kids helping you yeah of course man

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.040
or you could send them to the fact you

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:01.839
should be able to send your like

00:48:01.839 --> 00:48:03.280
six-year-olds to the factory nice and

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.920
just clock it all day yeah so you'd send

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.839
him the factory and what would happen is

00:48:07.839 --> 00:48:09.839
your wife most times

00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:11.119
like there was a lot of widowers back

00:48:11.119 --> 00:48:13.119
things your wife would die so you would

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:15.119
just your dudes would be constantly

00:48:15.119 --> 00:48:17.119
getting reset up so like you'd have like

00:48:17.119 --> 00:48:18.480
two kids your wife should die on the

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.960
third one and then they'd be like yo my

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.720
cousin you you needed to get married

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.200
immediately out of the bullpen it would

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.119
he would ruin you economically sturdy

00:48:27.119 --> 00:48:28.079
broad

00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:29.520
it would ruin you economically so you'd

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.040
start pieing you'd be like all right

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.640
let's start playing cause i k time is

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.880
money and i got a pie yeah to extend my

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.800
empire so dudes were just pieing back

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.960
then and you're just every time you bite

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.400
you were like imagine if you pied and

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.040
you were like yes yes like there was no

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.960
part of it a dollar a week extra i'm

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.400
gonna put this little [ __ ] in a

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.400
factory as soon as you turn six oh then

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.680
they lose a hand and you're like we're

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.359
ruined they're [ __ ] now you gotta pie

00:48:51.359 --> 00:48:53.040
again you just pie again you gotta pie

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.319
again but now you gotta take care of the

00:48:54.319 --> 00:48:55.839
handles one

00:48:55.839 --> 00:48:57.680
ah back then you can put them down you

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.599
can [ __ ]

00:48:59.599 --> 00:49:01.680
look now this kid worships the devil

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.760
[ __ ] he said

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.599
well yeah dude you would just buy and

00:49:05.599 --> 00:49:07.520
every single time you'd be like yes

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.079
jackpot awesome we hit the jackpot that

00:49:10.079 --> 00:49:11.599
was must have been such a crazy world to

00:49:11.599 --> 00:49:12.960
live in it was like that for the

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.200
majority of time between like

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.640
also you might get a daughter but then

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.839
again like you're saying get the dowry

00:49:17.839 --> 00:49:19.839
so that that was a ticking time bomb you

00:49:19.839 --> 00:49:21.200
had to just [ __ ]

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.480
block that you only had to really guard

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.240
them until they were 14.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.760
so they get to block the puss so they're

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.640
14 respectively block the puss and then

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.160
send your boy send them out to the fact

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.520
you probably could send the girls to the

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.280
fact too yeah it's your coin and coin

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.280
and coin and you got the boys going oh

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.160
wife dies new snazz then you start you

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.240
start pieing a new snizz

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.520
and then it's just non-stop dudes would

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.040
have like most dudes would get like

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.880
three wives like this you're like dude

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.040

that's the thing too it makes me

01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:19.039
i find it hard to believe that he

01:03:19.039 --> 01:03:20.240
continued being a billionaire if

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.359

01:03:21.359 --> 01:03:22.960
control like or unless he has money

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.160
managers

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.599
because he's enough money to like go to

01:03:25.599 --> 01:03:26.640
war

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.559

act up when you sanction them you

01:04:11.119 --> 01:04:12.640
