00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:13.009
a little bear swap for you those bears

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:16.050
completely asleep on the couch so that's

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.459
the good sign perfect I was gonna give

00:11:17.459 --> 00:11:18.660
it to Becky but I don't want them

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.559
[ __ ] spiraling be careful it's really

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:24.149
far it's funny because it reminds me of

00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:25.829
living with Becky Owen is like when I

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:28.889

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.339
again gone when I give edibles to Becky

00:11:32.339 --> 00:11:34.379
on sort of feels like like whoo he's not

yeah how did you learn how to make

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.449
edibles trial and error

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:58.530
[Laughter]

00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:01.889
now YouTube actually has a lot of good

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:04.170
stuff yeah yeah you can watch YouTube to

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.490
like make anything right feel like

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.959
YouTube shortened everything so like

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.129

dogs go to heaven

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.260
yeah that's one thing that's been

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.720
happening on Facebook is in the facebook

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.700

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:41.250

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:46.440
things to say dog like every time really

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.330
it is sad but it's nice it actually is

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.300
nice I think so anyway that's my take on

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.260

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.270
Facebook yeah post your dead dog

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.660
level oh man I stand by that dog getting

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.650
hit by car video though that led to

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.500
Pippin oh yeah and also that dog getting

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:20.580

skinny component of Russian speeds and

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:29.910

kind of benign they're just more about

00:57:46.019 --> 00:57:47.400
their technology it's more of an

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.900

wow that was a close I know what about

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.570
to do a change the world but what

01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:13.420
happens a good can you bring up the

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.430
loose change documentary on YouTube to

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:18.960
hear the kids voice or you guess yes

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.340
[ __ ] government conspiracy and the

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:33.130
kids vo 22 year old kids names Tyler or

01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:38.740
something dedicated to the lives that we

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:43.270
lost on September 11 or not yeah it was

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:57.160
a bunch of style of Shane explode inner

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:57.690
esteem

01:06:57.690 --> 01:07:00.730
I think tower 7 dude what do you think

01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:03.520
about that was a genetic the guy who

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.200
made loose change one was on ona one

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.490
time a baby said he's bring it up so we

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:07.600
can actually hear his voice over because

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.250
the trailer they conveniently cut his

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:11.140
voice out smart I thought the soundtrack

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:14.230
was well some all day and he was like

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:15.490
you know why building seven felt because

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:16.870
the other the debris fell into it's

01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:25.180
stupid so find out if Gillette's

01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:28.870
headquarters was in tower seven I can

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:32.770
argue both scenarios what that Gillette

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:34.930
was involved with 911 because that's

01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:36.490
that's what this commercial is leading

01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:37.840
us to believe that they are going to

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.700
completely ignore the most masculine the

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:42.910
most toxic masculinity of easily the

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:46.110
past 200 years

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:57.150
what 210 years dude

01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:59.680
damn Carlin's hardcore history right now

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.580
about the Japanese that's I'm just being

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.420
culturally so funny to you

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:38.740
yeah your tree grows then more bark more

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:42.009
Park you could if I had Japanese enemies

01:08:42.009 --> 01:08:43.839
- that'd be great if you had a whole

01:08:43.839 --> 01:08:45.759

goddamn throwing star from hot did you

01:09:02.109 --> 01:09:03.910
find whose change the document I believe

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:08.500
this is it have like The Last Samurai

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.730
but you don't learn anything techniques

01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:15.299
you just throw in hey sideways punches

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:33.220
we're seeing you're confident you could

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:36.010
argue for loose changes theories yeah

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:37.900
and I could argue that it was an inside

01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:39.850
job you could argue it is an inside job

01:09:39.850 --> 01:09:42.010
your provocateur I think so yeah what

01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:44.470
what facts do you got

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:46.390
bring it real against Piercy theory on

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.730
the bonfire let's see I guess the the

01:09:48.730 --> 01:09:50.620
molten steel is big mm-hmm and then

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.390
building sevens big and then um you know

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:53.890
a couple people getting killed like um

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:56.470
this guy who was a maintenance worker in

01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:58.120
I think the South Tower he said that he

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.500
pulled a guy out of the building and the

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.300
guy's skin was on fire and then

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:03.640
allegedly he like shot himself a few

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.620
well what's funny is so the conspiracy

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.260
people are like disk so he they showed

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.520
his suicide note and it looks like it

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.160
was written by seven-year-old yeah but

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.780
it's like he was a maintenance worker in

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:15.550
New York so maybe it was really a

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:19.750
suicide note this life sucks how do you

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:23.650
