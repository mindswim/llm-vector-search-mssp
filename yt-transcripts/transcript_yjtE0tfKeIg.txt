00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.519
i think it's just taking away

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.800
will to live a little bit we need a

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.480
quest we need a

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.120
quest to go on it's true we got to find

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.400
something to do what would it be what

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.440
would you do for a question sammy um

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.519
probably kill someone famous

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.560
yeah who are you thinking

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.200
[Laughter]

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.200
who else uh [ __ ]

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.519
she's got your laser why is he why is he

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.519
ducking you dude i don't know he's i

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.040
think he's uh i mean he looks bigger

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.640
than me but i think that's because he

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.720
has a small head

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.599
is he tall he's my he's i think he's six

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.720
three

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.159
well you're five five he's an inch

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.000
shorter than me well he's a full foot

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.319
taller than me yeah so he he's gonna

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.760
tower over you but his whole thing is

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.440
he's supposed to be like the alpha male

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.040
of the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.720
libtards

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.120
so he's this is his role is to to

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.519
vanquish me he should he's got to do

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.959
he's got to do something about it how

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.239
did he take that role he um he saw my

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.480
avatar on twitter and he went no no no

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.879
no no not looking at that on his life he

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.319
did that on this like live stream like

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.080
he had a panic attack he knew he knew he

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.760
hated what he saw no he just he knew who

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.280
i was because i've been calling him out

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.640
i don't know his whole thing is the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.280
thing is like aggressively ignoring me

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.480
oh man and people his his uh

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.159
benefit his um

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.920
defenders will say that it's because he

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.840
doesn't want to platform me like he

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.920
doesn't want to give me a platform yeah

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.680
but it's it's because he

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.080
it doesn't want anything to do with that

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.599
and he's just banging porn stars right

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.400
now right

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.080
i mean he's probably he's probably

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.959
banging some some nasty folks isn't his

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.799

well actually this is what that's one

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.359

i remember being shy a little bit

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.200
i like how uh i like how specifically

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.840
you break down comedians like you talk

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.120
about um

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.360
amateur comedians there was one thing

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.240
you were

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.000
pointing out that's like

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.760
very stereotypical that which is when

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.280
they say uh as you do oh yeah that [ __ ]

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.480
like you did

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.360
as one does yes it's just like a little

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.760
little uh linguistic like word yeah yeah

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.159
that people so i'm single

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:50.080
into that that's the class thing oh

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.200
there's one they do

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.559
there's one that they do where they uh

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:54.159
where they're like so i was going

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:55.600
through the garbage looking for a

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.640
pop-tarts to eat as you do yeah but

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.320
that's like a very common and it's like

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.400
it's such a oddly specific

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.039
combination of words to become so as

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:06.480
common as it is

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.400
that it just the the joe the point is

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.679
that

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:12.159
the specificity of it

00:23:12.159 --> 00:23:15.200
makes it obvious how derivative all the

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.559
[ __ ] is because they're all just

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:18.559
watching each other right

00:23:18.559 --> 00:23:21.440

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.159
nightmare with gas and where you were

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.440
explaining when you were chasing them

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.240
down

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.280
our guy is um he got the gas fees low

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.119
it get what do you mean gas you have to

00:34:35.119 --> 00:34:37.679
pay money to make this [ __ ] to sell it

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.280
what's gas

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.919
yeah it's the fee that you pay to to

00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:43.679
make your nft

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.599
is what gas is it's a transaction fee

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:47.520
but it's especially high from making

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.599
nfts if you mint your nft on a certain

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:51.679
platform they're higher gas on ethereum

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.359
it's ethereum specifically that has high

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:54.879
gas phases because everybody's trying to

00:34:54.879 --> 00:34:57.200
use it right now you have cryptocurrency

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.200

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.160
some ethereum yes yeah are you stacking

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.560
your bitcoin no i it's not a lot but

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.480

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.400
bitcoin yeah yeah for real he got me

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.520
into it

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.200

yeah dollars five percent if you're

00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:21.200
stacking if you got a fat uh if you got

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.359
like 200 grand in a bank account

00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:24.880
you're like throwing like if it stays

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.160
there for a year you probably turn that

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.320
into like 175.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.800
bitcoin is a is a um

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.880
it's the apex predator digital that

would be right

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.200

days are you following any of the

01:06:33.359 --> 01:06:35.920
trucker con the trucker stuff that nick

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.359
was talking about no i've been i've been

01:06:37.359 --> 01:06:39.440
watching bill maher though oh you have

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.920
yeah he's well he's he's not that bad is

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.520
he now is he coming around he's coming

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.839
around a little bit he's like

01:06:45.839 --> 01:06:47.839
i don't know i'm not saying he's

01:06:47.839 --> 01:06:49.680
obviously he's he's [ __ ] he's a

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.599
snarky dork but

01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:53.520
he's like been

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.839
for that platform he's doing better than

01:06:55.839 --> 01:06:57.200
everybody is he's starting to see the

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.039
cracks being like a liberal guy on hbo

01:07:01.039 --> 01:07:02.319
because he has to

01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:03.200
maybe

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.920
well my my theory is that they're uh

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.000
as it becomes obvious that the

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.920
the mask stuff and the vaccine stuff

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.440
cannot go on indefinitely they're going

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.599
to have to start rolling it back

01:07:13.599 --> 01:07:15.359
strategically yeah that's exactly what

01:07:15.359 --> 01:07:16.960
it is he's just the tip of the spear

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.119
yeah he's like oh he's got his eye well

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:20.400
it's working because he's tricking me

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.760
out like you know what i've been wrong

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.520
about bill maher i've got this guy

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.599
pegged in there yeah i get tricked you

01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:27.039
moving your needle on the new york times

01:07:27.039 --> 01:07:28.720
is actually rational they're starting to

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.839
see the new science that's out

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:34.400
yeah i get tricked easily by all that me

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.559

01:07:36.559 --> 01:07:38.559

love that i think that's like my

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.400
favorite one of my favorite theories and

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.199

the guy googling something and just

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.080
being like

01:08:44.239 --> 01:08:45.759
street like the people walking around

01:08:45.759 --> 01:08:47.120
and now what happened

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.799
well not to bring it back to car stuff

01:08:48.799 --> 01:08:50.159
but they have um

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:52.880
car dealerships set up

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.040
where they have actors

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.080
who pretend to be customers

01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.120
what

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.880
specifically can you look this up can

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.040
you pull this up johnny the cars first

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.480
of all they're like it's like the fakest

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.920
cars you've ever seen yeah like they're

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.080
like uh if we ask the art department to

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.000
put make a jeep and make it look make it

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.920
look real auto vehicle put it make it

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.679
build a jeep make it look real so they

01:09:13.679 --> 01:09:15.120
have all these yeah north korea car

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.159
dealership

01:09:16.159 --> 01:09:19.359

and the reason they're actors

01:09:38.159 --> 01:09:39.359
the reason there's actors is they have

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:41.120
people pretending that they have the and

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.480

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.000
lot of the quest on this podcast and

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.679
like we talked about it as it was

01:11:51.679 --> 01:11:54.159
happening it was such a painful segment

01:11:54.159 --> 01:11:55.760
like

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.000
watching a movie and talking about it as

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.280
it's playing what's the question it's

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.040
just [ __ ] it's a jean-claude van

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.199
damme movie about a kumite

01:12:03.199 --> 01:12:05.760
where he fights uh he fights all these

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.440
different fighters but the catch is that

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.560
they're all

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.560
every nation and every fighting style is

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.320
represented it's the same thing as

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.080
bloods yeah it sounds like bloodsport

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.920
yeah it was in bloodsport too yeah yeah

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.600
well that idea really captured them

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.679
where the movies would like cascade like

01:12:21.679 --> 01:12:24.640
80 of the plot for the next movie so

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.840
it'd be like bloodsport and then the

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.199
quest would be like

01:12:27.199 --> 01:12:29.120
most of that and then there was like

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.880
lionheart where there's like also i

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.520
