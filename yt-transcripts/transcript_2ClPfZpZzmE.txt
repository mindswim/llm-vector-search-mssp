00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:20.240
equals and we want feminism to be a

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.839
thing but it's really difficult when

00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:23.440
every woman makes the same point about

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.440
her vagina over and over again i think

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.800
i'm the only woman out here that has a

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.959
joke about world war ii in my set

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.240

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.279

call them female misogynists so if you

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.600
don't agree with women that you're a

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.880
female misogynist and you're just

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.959
co-opted by men it's like or

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:10.240

trying to tell me like

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.640
i was like you understand with like was

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.000
like with stand up and i was telling her

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.600
like guys now

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.520
younger guys the further they can push

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.360
themselves from like being masculine the

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.799
better it is for them like they go up

00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:28.320
there and they're like my dad's like you

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.159
know like moe's lawn and i'm i'm just

00:21:30.159 --> 00:21:32.320

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.159
telling me that society doesn't

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:37.120
appreciate your white masculinity and i

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.240
was like i'm not talking about society

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.520

getting crushed well here's the thing

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.880
though stand-up comedy comedians

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.159
appreciate that

00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:50.320
and but then go to a crowd

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.480

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.400
masculinity true so if you go up there

no tippers

00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:35.040
i don't know i don't know if the

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.800
listener knows that oh i mean that's

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.880
that's a well established thing

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.079
yeah that was like the number then i'd

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:41.280
be in a restaurant though and i'd be you

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.480
know we'd be now and it was you know

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.760
it's a whole different thing and the

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.280
[ __ ] service is abysmal so i'm like

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.640
this is ridiculous and i deliver pizza

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.599
and i'm like

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:50.079
this is a very complicated problem this

00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:52.079
is the ones that needs to be

00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:53.520
handled gingerly

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.880
well

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.839
black people in comedy clubs don't tip

00:37:57.839 --> 00:37:59.280
yeah that's a that's beef among the

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.760
waiters that's big you go to any comedy

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.880
club ask a waiter yeah it's fired up

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.720
it's true they get [ __ ] they buy [ __ ]

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.240
i understand their rationale they go in

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.400
and ball they [ __ ] buy they spend a

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.920
lot of money on food and stuff [ __ ]

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.560
tipping it's not their responsibility

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.680
that they're paying should be giving

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.839
those waiters

00:38:16.839 --> 00:38:18.720
more that's a valid point that's a valid

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.240
point and it's like you're balling out

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.599
and it's just like

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.880
[ __ ] this guy you know what i mean like

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.599
yeah

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:25.119
if i was black and some little white

00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:26.480
girl came up to me this is funny because

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.839

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:29.119
sitting there and i've been drinking

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.160
when i thought the one guy was the other

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.920
guy in the [ __ ] the the one dude was

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.119
talking about

00:40:41.119 --> 00:40:43.200
how i was reading a blank they all have

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.839
wild [ __ ] versions of history with no

00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:48.000
[ __ ] not they all jesus christ but a

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
lot of these guys dude like same thing

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.599
as white racist yeah

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:52.560
but

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.160
here's the difference you don't hear

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.839
like i i will have a

00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:57.680
conversation about history with a bunch

00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.760
of white dudes yeah

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.880
i don't know if black dudes are sitting

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.560
around doing the same thing

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.200
but there are definitely white

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.200
racists that are having wild history

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.560
conversations

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.640
and black racists having wild history

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.280
conversations do you see what i'm saying

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.960
yeah so you're saying you don't know if

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.800
black dudes are talking history

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.440
yeah not really yeah i don't think

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.119

and i was just talking about the civil

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.200
war true i really don't think that's

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.319
happening

00:41:30.319 --> 00:41:32.000
fair point and

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:32.720
it's

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.640
it's funny that it's like that's racist

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.720
it's like no i'll bet my entire [ __ ]

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.440
life yeah that there aren't a car of two

did you know this is actually where lee

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.920
this is the high water mark of the

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.920
southern army this is the furthest

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.839
dude that's fair and also

00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:50.079
i mean also that's almost a uh like in

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:51.520
spike lee movies that's almost like a

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.200
black caricature of some guy being like

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.720

yeah like that's crazy ass dude yeah the

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.319
only guys talking history

that are black or [ __ ] wild that's a

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.880
wild wizard clothes

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.480

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.079
[ __ ] they're [ __ ] wild and they're

00:42:08.079 --> 00:42:10.079
talking about how like there was black

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:11.760
wall street in tulsa oklahoma and the

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.200
white man came and destroyed it because

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.880
it was too prosperous yeah like they're

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.520
all they're all drinking gold like 200

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.280
years ago you know africa was home to

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.280
all the greatest empires yeah no it

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.960
wasn't

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.560
well that was the uh

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.359
[ __ ]

00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:26.640
that one guy was talking about he was

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.400
like it was the big

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.839
i think thorn thorning that is like well

00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:32.319
like nigerians sold or black people sold

00:42:32.319 --> 00:42:33.440
out other black people to slavery and

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.680
this guy was like the untold archives

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.200
tell us that there was all of our

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.520
warriors ran and got shot on the shores

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.119
trying to free the [ __ ] slay and it's

00:42:41.119 --> 00:42:42.079
like

00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:43.599
i mean i didn't read that book i don't

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:46.480
lose in history yeah like they can't be

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.040
bad in history yeah and and it's funny

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.040
because it's it's uh [ __ ] here we go we

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.440
we've deleted this before what me trying

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.200
to talk history on this yeah but dude we

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.520
we were like we went uber specific yeah

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.720
but it's like there's this

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.800
liberalization of history right now and

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.640
it's very weird to see they're they're

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.319
just going back and just

00:43:04.319 --> 00:43:05.680
twisting tweaking things just a little

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.520
bit to make them more progressive

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.200
it's weird what do you mean like or just

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.560
focusing on certain little things in a

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.560
history book there's now a chapter on

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.200
the [ __ ] ku klux klan or there's more

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.319
like

00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:19.280
race is becoming a [ __ ] focal point

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.520
in american history or in world history

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.440
yeah versus

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.880
i don't know i think it's exceeding what

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.720
it's actually it's level of importance

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.000
well it should be if we're trying to get

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.359
rid of yeah but it's like anything else

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:31.440
they did they like went so

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.800
like they were like teaching me in grade

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.240
school that like thanksgiving the

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.680
indians were chilling and like everyone

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.599
was having a fun time so they like went

00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:38.880
the other way and then people complained

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.480
so like now they just like flipped it

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.800
180 yeah now try to make it like well

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.400
here it's like everyone was being an

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.319
[ __ ] some people came out on top no

00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:47.599
but see that's the thing you can't say

00:43:47.599 --> 00:43:49.200
everyone was being an [ __ ] now it's

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.040
just white guys came and destroyed an

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.520
incredibly peaceful group of people yeah

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.440
exactly and that's not necessarily the

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.560
[ __ ] and africa was great and then

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.720
colonists came and destroyed it yeah

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.560
i've i've heard stuff similar to that

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.920

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.040
i don't know enough about history

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.400
there's dude there's a new movie coming

detroit uh the race riots in like 1967.

00:44:12.319 --> 00:44:13.520
it'll still be a good movie but it's

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.800
just like

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.119
is anybody noticing that these are just

00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:19.200
clearly money grabs

that it's like all right race is the

00:44:20.839 --> 00:44:22.480

00:48:34.319 --> 00:48:36.000
talking people like slapping women

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.359

00:48:39.359 --> 00:48:40.800
feminist march

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.960
yeah yeah let's figure out where we are

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.440
here it's dude there's no thought no of

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.280

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.839
exact moment biggie's cool i like biggie

00:48:49.839 --> 00:48:52.079
yeah yeah i'm sure he's the voice of the

00:48:52.079 --> 00:48:54.400
oppressed he's a poet he's like no he's

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.240
a fat [ __ ] rapper who talked about

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.079
drugs and guns he was cool as [ __ ] i

00:48:58.079 --> 00:48:59.920
loved him he's just a cool guy i also

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.160
think what he's saying is awesome dude i

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.160
look at wrestlers the same way i look at

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.839
like wwf

00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:07.520
i mean rappers the same way

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.200
yeah yeah yeah yeah same exact [ __ ]

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.800
thing there's they make up personalities

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.480
they're wild-ass personalities they're

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.160
like yeah i [ __ ] kill everybody

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.200
[ __ ] yeah get them gucci mane

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.440
gucci man's the best

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.440
i actually like yeah i only like when

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.800
they talk about killing people and rap

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.319
when someone's like yo we gotta come

00:49:24.319 --> 00:49:26.400
like this is good if a rapper is like we

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.680
gotta come together like shut the [ __ ]

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.200
up shut up dude beef

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.240
that's another thing rappers are very

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.920
homophobic oh yeah and misogynistic yeah

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.079
a lot of racism a lot of [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:49:40.079 --> 00:49:42.000
white people yeah i mean dude i get it

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.520
yeah they fired up i like it i

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.119
appreciate it that's why i put it on a

00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:46.640
pedestal and it's funny because that's

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.880
why uh like young white kids are so

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.880
drawn to it because there's nothing like

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.319
that for the young white kids to like

00:49:52.319 --> 00:49:53.920
get into it and be like [ __ ] yeah i'ma

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.599
[ __ ] kill you yeah now they can

00:49:55.599 --> 00:49:57.119
actually like dig in the country a

00:49:57.119 --> 00:49:58.559
little bit now i think it's a little

00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:01.119
inundated i think we're gonna

00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:02.720
now that rap is

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.040
totally mainstream yeah now that rap is

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.680
entirely mainstream uh-huh i think it's

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.119
it's a little less

00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:11.280
provocative and enticing for the young

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.880
white bulls

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.160
truly well dude i remember they're still

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.200
going to listen to it no but they all

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.960
one country a lot of like i'm when i

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.559
grew up it was like you listen if you

00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:19.599
listen to rap you were cool

00:50:19.599 --> 00:50:21.760
automatically and now like i pulled up

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.079

00:50:32.559 --> 00:50:34.160

about being a wigger i was having

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.880
flashbacks to the

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.640

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.640

right no i'm not saying deleted i'm just

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.559
saying i i thought you thought it was

00:53:42.559 --> 00:53:44.400

00:53:53.599 --> 00:53:55.119
perfect sense

00:53:55.119 --> 00:53:56.880
nobody does talk about like when one of

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:59.440

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.359

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.319
jealous so they took it yeah just like

00:54:20.319 --> 00:54:22.160
