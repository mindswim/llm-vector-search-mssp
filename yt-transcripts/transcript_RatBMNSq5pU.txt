i i honestly up until probably 12 hours

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.760
ago i would have said complete garbage

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.280

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.120
homework i'm gonna say the kids all

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.200

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.000
like harrisburg or something right i'm

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.239
leaning garbage that's tough uh you're

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.159
from like central pa a little bit i'm

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.280
from mechanicsburg so

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.720
uh yeah but i grew up in like a a nice a

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.439
nice house and a nice neighborhood how

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.239
far away were you from harrisburg

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.079
uh it's like 20 minutes west or east

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.520
yeah so it's about the same comparison

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.440
to where we are to philly so

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.199
yeah um

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.600
but definitely rural right blue collar

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.840
yeah yeah well it's weird how much this

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.160
area has changed in the last like

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.400
10 years i mean it was definitely

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.400
very rural and very blue-collar but now

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.440
it's totally suburban

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.600
and we were one of the first suburban

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.680
neighborhoods out here so i've always

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.479
been

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.759
it's always a good look when you have

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.600
kids new money i like it

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.840

gentrified

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.360

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.280
is is that kind of never really like my

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.680
kids hopefully will have zero garbage

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.840
i'm half sure so this is this is what

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.840
we're finding out about it's like it's

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.360
generational you know what i mean like

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.680
if your dad was garbage you're garbage

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.880
your kids

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.000
might even be

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.080
unless unless you have like an all-star

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.479
career they're gonna be somewhat [ __ ]

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.520
garbage

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.360
yeah yeah i have this thing where i'm

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.039

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.639
that my dad does and like i'm starting

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.639
to like just like the mannerisms are

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.840
like oh everything yeah so that that

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.840
that inherent garbage doesn't really go

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.759
away too easily i gotta say i saw an

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.919
instagram story of you your dad's a

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:54.800
[ __ ]

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.880
[ __ ] brick [ __ ] house he'd still kick

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.479
your ass right

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.479
uh that's that's been the debate lately

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.960
in fact earlier today dude that is such

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.479
i do with my dad i used to put my dad

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.000
it's such a trash thing if you're like i

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.680
got to take you he's like i got one more

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.600
left in me kid i was getting a hundred

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.960
percent what he says

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.199
i was gonna ask you i was gonna ask you

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.960
as a question and it was gonna be a

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.319
trick question like whether you thought

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.000
you could beat your dad up and the trick

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.759
question is if you even think about that

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.840
you're [ __ ] trash because intelligent

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.759
classy people don't think about fist

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.919
fighting their own game

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:26.880
about it

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.280
i literally before this podcast started

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.520

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.400
kitchen

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.039
today and he because i you know i

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.639
squared up to him and like jabbed him a

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.720
little and joking around

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.560
yeah of course and then

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.440
he he was like i'll i'll [ __ ] you up and

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.759
i was like i would beat the [ __ ] out of

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:46.720
you

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.479
and this was in front of my mother so

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.599
maybe it's not all classic

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.520
she backs your dad up she backs your old

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.960
man up like yeah he'll kick your [ __ ]

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.000
ass [ __ ] oh he's done that so one time

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.199
uh i came out of the bathroom and my dad

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.520
[ __ ] towel whipped me in the face

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.280
okay oh he was doing laundry which is

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.120
right outside

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.720
it was insane he towel whipped me in the

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.599
face

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:13.759
and then i [ __ ] grabbed the towel

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.720
and he hid behind my mother and i was

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.520
like

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.199
i was like if joan you better move or

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.520
i'm gonna [ __ ] towel whip you

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.280
and she stayed still

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.120
so i towel whipped her and normally i'm

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.880
bad at towel whipping but i [ __ ] it

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.800
was a perfect crack and she started

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.800
crying

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.759
my dad went from like all this is

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:37.360
playful to just in my [ __ ] face

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.360
like he hit his girl

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.639
yeah he got my face it was just like

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:44.520
i'll [ __ ] you up you [ __ ]

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:46.639
dude my dad's called me a [ __ ] so many

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:49.520
times it was crazy yeah there's a in in

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.520
trashy families there's a 10-year period

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.360
where where the son and the dad are just

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.759
at like a constant [ __ ] standoff of

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:57.520
who wants to [ __ ] test it you know

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.400
what i mean

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.160
because once they get into their 60s

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.680
they start losing a little a little bit

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.919
more but from like from 50 to 60 it's

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:06.319
just two two [ __ ] lions iron each

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.319
other up and i got

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:09.919
when i was i was playing football so i

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:12.879
got very big and i would i just would

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:15.199
bully this [ __ ] guy like he was

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:17.759
he was probably like 50 years old

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:19.759
and i was you know i was [ __ ] flexing

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:22.800
on him and [ __ ] like college football

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.639
so i would like wrestle him and beat his

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:26.400
at but if we fist fought back then he

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.919
would have [ __ ] me up yeah it's a

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:29.199
weird thing there's some kind of

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:31.440
psychology or like yeah like even at

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.200
like you know like i played football too

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.760
in like my prime physical shape i was

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.000
still like scared you know not scared

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.279
but like i knew

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:41.200
there's something about a man's like a

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.959
grown man's hand

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:45.120
punching in the face that just does so

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.959
much damage and just even though they're

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.080
out of shape they have that look in

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.279
their eye like

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.920
yeah well they'll do it

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.200
and they're they're different that's the

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.040
that's the generational thing where my

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.800
dad grew up fighting constantly i've

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.120

constantly yeah so he's i mean from a

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.920
time here where like neighborhoods used

that if you show a little kid a bb gun

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.440
that's like the [ __ ] end i'm trying

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.680
to be the coolest [ __ ] guy yeah yeah

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.440
that's [ __ ] why growing up would your

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.160
dad ever continue driving

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.760
just to listen to the rest of the song

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.960
um

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.200
i would say definitely my dad my dad was

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.599
a big motown guy that's all he to is all

00:48:19.599 --> 00:48:21.920
he listens to to this day is motown

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.400
listens to the same [ __ ] 12 songs

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.920
that's classy

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.040
smooth

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.000
yeah he's a big motown guy so if my girl

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.520
was playing he'd take an extra lap

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.839
around the neighborhood

00:48:32.839 --> 00:48:34.559
undoubtedly

00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:36.079
undoubtedly here's

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:39.119
phil had some good he would always uh

00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:40.559
he'd always turn this so like let's say

00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:42.400
i wanted to go like rent a video game or

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.400
go to mcdonald's or something he would

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.559
always turn the turn signal on like he

00:48:46.559 --> 00:48:48.559
was gonna go that way

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:50.400
and then not go that way that's a big

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.760
move

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.160
right there he also my family would do

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.000
this this is this is kind of trashy now

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.280
looking back

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.200
it would park

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.520
after church after church which

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.200
sometimes me and my dad would drop my

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.040
sisters and mom off at church and say we

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.800
were gonna park the car and just go get

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.880
a car wash and uh

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.640
pick them up after church uh but he

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.240
they would get they would take me out of

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.559
the car and i would have to race the car

00:49:16.559 --> 00:49:17.920
from the top of the neighborhood to my

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.040
house

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.640
uh they would go you know they would

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.720
tell me that i was fast enough to beat

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.680
the car

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.160
and uh i would literally i would trip on

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.559
the curb every single time

00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:30.160
every single time i would fall off the

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.240
curb and my family would drive slowly

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.440
next to me

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.240
just waiting for me to fall

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.000
and that was every sunday and i never

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.520
stopped

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.079
your parents from jackass

i don't think so okay no that's always

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.800
that's always that always crosses a

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.480
weird line in a family well yeah

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.079
especially it would just be obviously it

00:50:08.079 --> 00:50:10.160
would be a cousin uh it'd be weird if i

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.720
went with my sisters

00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:25.520

01:13:46.719 --> 01:13:49.120
early 90s okay

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.840
there was a mad rush on several items

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.080
that you could only get through qvc or

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.480
the home shopping network and my aunts

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.960
and my mom would like take turns

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.800
like like they were calling in a radio

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.400
station for [ __ ]

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.560
bon jovi tickets to try to get a couple

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.360
of these items one of them was the

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.360
electric ashtray do you know what that

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.239

01:14:10.239 --> 01:14:11.760
it was yeah it sucked it had like an

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.440
exhaust fan on it or whatever that just

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.159
blew back out into the air

01:14:16.159 --> 01:14:17.360
yeah it just blew it out the side

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:18.960
instead of the top

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:22.159
your family is deep rooted garbage you

01:14:22.159 --> 01:14:24.159
your family hatched like a ponzi scheme

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.760
to get something to smoke more

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.320
cigarettes in the house you weren't

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.480
nobody was using that thing outside

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:34.159
that's an in-the-house smoking apparatus

01:14:34.159 --> 01:14:36.159
oh man that's [ __ ] true that's one

01:14:36.159 --> 01:14:37.360

ginsu knives [ __ ] all all that stuff

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.000
i think the ginsu knives was made by

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.520
like a jewish dude in long island that

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.440

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.159
pampered chef i think made a couple of

01:15:08.159 --> 01:15:11.520
