The audio levels arn't good. I messed up. It's only me running this thing. I'm sorry. Also, the video might be out of sync during the middle but not enough to be unwatchable and I'm sorry I did my best on all of it. 

The very funny Matt McCusker from Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast joined me for a sweet ass conversation about Irish folklore and Irish traditions, as well as some other ramblings. 

Matt has a book on sale called Overlook: A Story About Drugs, Disappointment and The American Dream. It is available for sale on https://www.amazon.com/Overlook-Story-About-Disappointment-American-ebook/dp/B07BW45YFR

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.120
[ __ ] this morning which was weird i had

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.640
like a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.720
i had like a bizarre unsettling dream

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.200
that like i was in my house with my

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.280
ex-wife and then i was in the house with

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.640
my current wife and then like i got a

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.239
knock on the door and my ex-wife's eye

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.519
was like looking through the window and

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.120
i woke up like that

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.720
that was [ __ ] horrible but you know

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.000
other than that i think i'm doing pretty

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.959
good

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.400
yeah when when the ex-wife is coming

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.280
into your

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.959
disturbing your dreams there's something

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.720
something going on yeah man it was

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.480
strange exactly i'm i'm like trying to

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.840
think i'm not trying to dwell on it but

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.280
i'm like dude what the [ __ ] is about to

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.280
happen in the next week or so

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.799
but other than that man i feel good i've

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.560
been you know i got a

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.000
got some stuff done this morning just

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
doing my thing that's great that's great

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.439
and i've been caught up in all this ams

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.079
not the amc the game stuff stuff and the

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.359
stock market have you been listening to

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.680
all this no what happened oh so pretty

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.800
much

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.759
um

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.800
i don't know if you know the stock

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.479
market and i don't i barely know

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.479
anything about it but there's been hedge

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.680
funds who've been

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.919
shorting companies for years and what

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.440
they did with gamestop was they kept

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.880
shorting the stock which means they were

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.000
hoping that would go down and true like

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.080
investment tactics they've pretty much

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.840
forced the stock to go down over the

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.120
last five years

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.000
and

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.840
a bunch of people on reddit realized

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.160
this and they said if we all just buy

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.479
gamestop and refuse to sell it they'll

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.720
be forced to pay us huge money because

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.960
they have to repay the short if that

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.199
makes sense so pretty much

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.880
an entire hedge fund has just been put

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.160
out of business over the last two days

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.840
just because a bunch of guys on reddit

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.080
have just absolutely crippled an

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.520
industry here so everyone's going nuts

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.600
evan's going crazy

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.440
yeah because i guess with stocks someone

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.960
explained it to me before it's like the

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.199
reason the price goes up and down

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.720
is just the fact that a lot of people

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.639
buy it so i guess if they bought a lot

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.240
and didn't sell it i'm trying to think

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.400
how they would artificially

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.639
make it go down well if you're once you

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.639
start selling it

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.320
the price will go down

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.600
yeah that's right yeah okay that makes

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.479
sense

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.000
if it's being bought constantly the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.440
price just goes down until it hits like

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.199
an equilibrium so they yeah that's that

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.560
shit's just evil man because there's

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.400
like there's a stuff the stock market is

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.840
cool and all but there's a part of it

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.440
where it's like like you're saying it's

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.199
based just on rumors or people [ __ ]

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.800
with like numbers to make money off of

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.320
essentially nothing which you know

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.520
appreciate it yeah it's like it's just

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.440
uh it's all about confidence and weird

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.600
[ __ ] and but they've been they've been

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.960
making millions of this for years and

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.560
years and years billions off it for

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.720
years so now suddenly it feels like like

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.360
a real the people have got together

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.000
on a thing called wall street bets where

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.600
it's just this community of idiots and

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.520
they call each other the retards like

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.039
that's what they call each other that's

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.120
how the the retards they're taking down

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.960
wall street and now everyone's after

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.319
them now they don't want to they think

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:16.080
it's like a league or somehow but what

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.600
what they're doing yeah they're saying

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.960
that it's like a lead yeah i mean that's

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.400
hilarious as soon as they start doing

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.520
what the other people are doing they're

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.440
like that's illegal that's a you know

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.880
yeah yeah you're not wearing a suit so

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.479
[ __ ] you yeah i was talking about this

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.319
on uh matt and shane's last night about

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.600
how

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.880
like for some reason like people just

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.319
accept the fact that credit card

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.120
interest is you know 27 percent it's

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.479
like you know

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.919
where

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.840
what vote was that done where the

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.199
popular vote was like yeah we should

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.639
raise credit card

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.639
like that's that's not you know someone

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.000
just got away with doing that and now

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.880
everyone's like yeah i guess i got to

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.880
pay 30 [ __ ] percent on my aim at my

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.240
amex card

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.080
it's like it just i i have this i'm

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.520
obsessed with this idea right now where

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.000
it's like nice i want to i want to find

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.400
a way to pull people at a large enough

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.720
scale so then you can take the popular

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.520
consensus on issues that are currently

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.039
so you say like you take like marijuana

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:06.400
legalization you can say all right let's

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.919
pull you know

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:09.360
using the internet

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.639
million people

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.319
and then see what percentage of people

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.919
actually want it to be illegal i mean

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.199
they kind of do this already but it

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.639
would be nice to have a like a polling

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.319
system that was more open source and not

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.720
just kind of like you know the polls

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.560
attached to cnn or whatever and then

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.319
just go buy item to item be like yeah

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.840
nobody wants that thing yeah you can get

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.960
rid of that and then start to put

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.400
pressure on people to stop all the

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.840
[ __ ]

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.199
yeah and you're saying have that

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:32.880
collectively collectively across the

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.520
states or or just state to state or what

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.720
you can do whatever you can do state to

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.840
state you do it at a federal level i

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.039
mean with the internet it doesn't matter

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:40.560
you can you can just take it because

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.319
people can like kind of

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:44.240
uh connect from anywhere so you could do

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.000
it it would just be funny to take like

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.880
these

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.319
shitty laws

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:49.919
and then be like well where did this

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:51.440
come from and then hold it up to popular

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.039
vote and be like yeah no nobody wants to

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.960
get rid of it nobody wants accurate

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.319
because they're like well that was a

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.759
vote that passed by your representatives

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:59.520

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:16.480

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.760
not bothering with it but yeah as i get

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.600
older i'm like this is [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.760
also you got a sizable fan base now

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.399
where you might be able to convince a

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:53.040
few people to start

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.920
just

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.600
create your own little political party

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.720
or something

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.080
yeah i don't know i'm always hesitant

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.760
because yeah just kind of that whole

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.240
that'll like arena is always weird and

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.839
kind of annoying and just morphs into

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:04.640
like

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.880
these weird like aoc types and all that

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.560
other the people on the right who do

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.240
that too just become like talking heads

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.000
and you know that's not very good just

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.040
like you were saying it's just a [ __ ]

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.480
job it doesn't have to become this big

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.079
thing it's like just

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:17.440
figure out what people want what don't

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.720
what they don't want take the popular

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.920
vote and like all right that's solved

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.920
and we'll revisit that you know in three

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.399
or four years yeah i i feel like it kind

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:26.079

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.079
kind of irish folklore and mythology and

00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:41.839
some other sort of bits and bobs that i

00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:44.240

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.600
i think you have some sort of

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.360
um knowledge on this stuff through

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.920

reading uh

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.800

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.399
bunch of mythology i always i always

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:02.240
start to do this and like kind of stop

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.240
but i read a decent amount of the the

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.720
irish folklore stuff um

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.040

course and i was like what the [ __ ] is

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.360
the ulster cycle not

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.760
coloring books and type of [ __ ] that

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.959

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.279
one thing i just i thought i'd bring up

00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:59.519
straight away was the idea of an irish

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:02.480
fairy ring and also an irish fairy

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.959

um so this lady came to give a talk

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:34.079
and she was from ireland she was kind of

00:14:34.079 --> 00:14:35.440
talking about all this mythology stuff

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.959
and how you know the lessons of it can

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:39.360
be useful and well you know all that

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.519
and i asked her

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.680
i asked her about the uh

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.199
uh she was saying something like she can

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:46.880
tie certain myths like certain

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.639
geographical areas within kind of

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:50.240
ireland yeah and i you know i was kind

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.480
of curious so i was like well one of my

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.680
i didn't tell her anything like where my

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.320
mom's family was from i was like my

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.760
mom's uncle would always tell me about

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.519
the man with a bag who would come take

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:01.360
me you know take little boys away yeah

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.720
put him in a stack

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.560
and she like like was like oh yeah

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.240
that's the blah blah blah your family's

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.440
probably from like the southern like

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.440
cork uh and i was like holy [ __ ] dude

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.760
she [ __ ] nailed it right away oh wow

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.880
that's when i was like that's [ __ ]

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.480
nuts so i started reading a bunch of it

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.320
the man will take you away i i do

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.600
remember that as like almost an

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.959
expression that the man will take you

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.440
away and we never had a name to him it

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.800
was almost like the boogeyman but there

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.279
wasn't it was it older people like my

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.320
grandmother would say things like that

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.310
the man will take you away yeah

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.639
[Laughter]

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:32.639
i thought that was more of a

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:34.320
disobedient thing for

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.760
children because back in the day in

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.519
ireland in the early 1900s if you were

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:38.959
just like a bold

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:40.560
kid they just send you to live with

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.279
priests you know really to a porsche if

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:45.279
you were like this really disobedient

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:46.639
and you got in trouble too many times

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:48.160
they would the state would take you from

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.440
your parents and just send you into this

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.519
um borstal school which was like a

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:55.360
school for orphans and

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.120
kids and then they would just force the

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.959
kids to work in farms and stuff

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.880
yeah and there was a whole lotta there

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.399
was a whole lot of

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:06.720
touching going on i i could see it dude

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.000
that's like the yeah that's the prime

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.759
setup so all the bad kids would get

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:11.519
taken and but you're living with priests

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:13.199
yeah yeah it was wild right now

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:14.560
ireland's going through this thing right

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.320
now we all they had this

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.240
another version for women that became

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.839
pregnant out of wedlock they would also

00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:22.160
go into these homes and it was like very

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.240
hush-hush big homes like right beside my

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.440
house is this giant building it's like a

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.440
it's huge big mansion it looks like the

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.440
white house and it's a secondary it's a

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.279
school now a high school now but so

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:35.279
that's where they send all the boys

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:37.279
and a lot of dead bodies were dug up

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:39.360
when they were like renovating the the

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.120
areas turning them into homes people

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.320
just be like

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.079
digging through like putting down a

00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:45.440
foundation and then suddenly all these

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.839
kids bones were just found and sometimes

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:48.880
they were like what the [ __ ] was that

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.079
they're like oh we don't know it's like

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:53.360
it was clearly you killed all the kids

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.600
jesus christ yeah ireland's [ __ ] nuts

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.680
but so does it the opposite of that was

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.360
the women were sent to these homes and

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.440
all the kids were either

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.240
the

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.480
bastard children were either sent to

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.600
america

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.240
and adopted like illegally they would

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.760
the priest that the church would just

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.039
take them off well they were just they

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:12.959
were killing the kids so

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:15.039
recently there was a like a pit where

00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:17.120
900 dead baby

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.919
were found in galway and then it was

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:21.760
like what the [ __ ] was that and then so

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.880
they opened up the books it turns out

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.160
they were just like

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.240
killing all these kids

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.079
jesus yeah it's [ __ ] crazy just

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.600
horrific so those people but if you're

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.480
like people's sisters were like say 17

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.919
and then they got pregnant and then they

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.440
were just like they just disappeared for

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.039
a while and no one was allowed to say

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:38.160
what happened

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.200
and you'd have to just because they

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.480
brought shame upon the family because

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.480
she got pregnant out of wedlock

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.919
oh so they were taking the kids that

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:45.280
were had out of wedlock and they would

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.200
just kill him yeah they

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.400
i don't know if they were killing them

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.080
but they were certainly not helping them

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.160
survive they had yeah

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.080
you know what they were doing but it was

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.440
treating them like house plants they're

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.720
like yeah i'll get around them yeah

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.480
leave them in the sun and if

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.559
it grows jesus man that's [ __ ] crazy

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:02.480
now the ireland's nuts man island's the

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.919
maddest stuff i don't know what i didn't

00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:06.640
really grow up religious though so

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.160
i think something happened you know

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.600
that's the only explanation is i think

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.840
something happened with my grandfather

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.000
and maybe someone in his family because

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.480
they he they were anti-religion you know

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.360
so really say someone dropped the paw

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.720
maybe

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.480
ireland's nut stuff a regroup like that

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.080
up until the 90s it was kind of just

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:24.960
like

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.520
oh yeah he's a pedo don't go near him

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.160
yeah and uh my neighbor's a pedo it

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.600
turns out actually

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.039
really my dad won't tell me what

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:34.400
happened because it's like he's still

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.400

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.480
used to go upstairs with him maybe i'd

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.600
have to talk to him i haven't talked to

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.520
him in a long long time but

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.960
that's a tough conversation you should

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.640
just message him put it on like his

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.320
facebook wall be like hey

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.960
whatever happened with that guy

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.720
remember you were

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.000
yeah alone in that room with the

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.600
pedophile turns out

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.880
i don't know but i think he might have

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.480
only been you know might want to touch

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.840
the women you might want to trust little

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.880
girls

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.960
i think that's potentially what happened

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.320
oh so you guys could just kind of kick

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.480
it then yeah yeah just hanging out going

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.919
he's like what girls do you like and i'm

00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:50.080
like oh like siobhan and he's like yeah

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.520
yeah i see that he's like yeah oh man

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.559
dude

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:56.240
that's [ __ ] crazy does he still live

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.120
there

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.720
but he's in prison now

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.880
is he really yeah he was locked up

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.640
so so what was ireland kind of letting

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.000
that go and i guess they cracked down on

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.160
the pedos in the 90s yeah they cracked

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.080
down on it big time because it was you

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.520
went the loud talk about it it was like

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.520
a real hush hush the church would like

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.200
you weren't allowed badmouth the church

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.440
so the church controlled the state

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.000
and it was like you were never allowed

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.360
badmouth to church so if you were to

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.720
come around and go like hey listen that

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.799
priest raped me people were like oh shut

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:24.480
up you that's not true

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.080
so then but in the 90s then everyone was

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.000
just like yo [ __ ] this can we can we

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.840
stop doing this now

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.120
the church kept that much of a

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.440
stronghold over ireland until the 90s

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.840
all and yeah and that was like dublin

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.799
and the cities which are more

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:38.640
progressive were able to get away from

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.720
it but even in the country just weird

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.200
[ __ ] like suicide is a shameful thing in

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.080
the catholic religion so if people were

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.760
if people killed themselves the the

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.600
guards the police would write down that

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.400
they

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.960
died of like something else you know

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.559
yeah rather than bring shame upon the

00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:57.679
family this is up until the 90s you know

00:20:57.679 --> 00:21:00.880
crazy stuff it's crazy but like i i

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.320
kind of just got the tail end of that

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.559
the change the revolution you know

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:06.080
yeah thank god dude that sounds brutal i

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.320
mean the uh because yeah my my family

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.679
was all into going to like catholic

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:11.360
church and everything but it was nothing

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.120
like like my mom takes it pretty

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.440
seriously um but for the most part we

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.480
would kind of go in there and just like

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.640
dick around every sunday yeah and then

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.120
like eat donuts and get out of there

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.280
yeah but it's yeah it's a it's a nuts

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.440
thing because my mother said they're

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.360
crazy religious they were all like nuns

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.000
and stuff and then my grandad he went to

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.320
church every single day twice twice on a

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.760
sunday he'd go

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.120
because they do it in two languages they

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.400
do it in irish and then they do it in

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.760
english and he'd go to boat of them just

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.360
because he was like

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.080
just

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.240
i don't know just killing time until he

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.240
died i guess yeah that was my mom goes

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.080
every day she's she goes to the daily

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.559
mass yeah she loves it she does it now

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:50.240
yeah oh wow

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.000
she has the daily one that was nice if

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.440
you skipped if you missed sunday then

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.360
like you go to with her on monday and it

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.520
was like it's 30 minutes versus like you

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.280
know an hour and whatever wow that's

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.039
great that was always a nice move that

00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:03.760
was nice so a lot of this old stuff

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.200
especially the folklore like you said

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.200
with the the getting the man who put you

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.200
in the bag it still hangs over you even

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.960
though a lot of we'll say you don't

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.960
believe in it a lot of irish people

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.520
still kind of believe in it now the

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.360
the fairy rings

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.240
and

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.679
they're much more believed in the

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:20.640
country and i'll tell you what we

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.240
believe in dublin too because it's just

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.840
a lot of that stuff gets passed down

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.440
because we're i don't know we're a silly

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.400
people

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.440
um

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.360
so according to folklore a fairy ring

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.200
appears when a fairy a pixie or an elf

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.720
appears the circular pattern of

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.720
mushrooms looks like a place where the

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.679
fairy dances in a ring holding hands

00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:42.559
an irish legend recorded by jane wilde

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:44.000
and oh that's the mother of oscar wilde

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.159
apparently all right and a farmer built

00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:47.919
a barn on a fairy ring despite the

00:22:47.919 --> 00:22:49.760
protest of his neighbors he was struck

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.159
scentless senseless one night

00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:54.240
and a local fairy doctor was called to

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.480
break the curse the farmer says that he

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.520
dreamed that he must destroy the barn

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.880
and

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.480
so that was that's like the story that

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.320
it's like if you destroy

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.520
the

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.440
fairy ring which is just like a circle

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.120
of mushrooms i guess

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.440
and you get bad luck

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.520
and it's also if you go inside you get

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.520
bad luck if you collect any jew from the

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.480
or do is whatever you call it here do

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.960
and it's also a bad look

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.120
and you basically can't go in or around

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.120
those things no and i but i think that

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.960
the common

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.559
idea is that i think a lot of these are

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:32.159
actually magic mushrooms and people were

00:23:32.159 --> 00:23:33.919
like eating them and they were getting

00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:36.080
[ __ ] up so then they're like there was

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.600
a spell cast on me by a pixie

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.570
these guys dripping balls

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.600
[Laughter]

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.440
i mean that's the only logical solution

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.240
if you were to kind of unknowingly eat a

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.760
magic mushroom you'd be like this is

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.840
clearly a [ __ ] spell yeah if you were

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.520
just walking around normal had a couple

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.960
of mushrooms that you usually have and

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.559
then one day you just get [ __ ] fried

00:23:58.559 --> 00:23:59.679
it's gone

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:02.640
no don't go near it but

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.240
up until modern times moonshine

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.000
distillers traditionally discard the

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.880
first

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.200
50 milliliters of

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.480
alcohol

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.760
and

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.320
known as the fairy portion

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.159
so they do that to uh

00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:19.039
uh

00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:21.919
to just like take to banish the fairies

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:24.159
so this is really yeah but i know people

00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:25.760
from now we didn't really grow up with

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.799
these because

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:27.760
you know in the city you don't have

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.240
mushrooms like that but i do know people

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.600
from the country that would still to

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.799
this day if they're walking down the

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:33.760
street and they if they're walking

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.679
through a field and they see a ring of

00:24:35.679 --> 00:24:37.360
mushrooms they won't walk through it

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.480
yeah they'll move around it but they'll

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.840
go i don't believe in it but i'm also

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.720
not

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.960
i'm not tempted i'm not you know yeah

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.760
yeah

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.360
yeah it's like the don't step on a crack

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.720
break your mother's back thing i'll

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.320
still kind of sometimes catch myself and

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.080
be like oh [ __ ] i stepped on a crack

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.120
yeah we

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.360
yeah of course it's just hands down

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.720
we have a thing in ireland you're not

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.559
supposed to walk on there like

00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:58.320
signposts you know signposts to have

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.039
like

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.080
sometimes they're held up and they've

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.240
got two like legs yeah you're walking

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.120
down the street you'll see a lot of

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.880
people oh [ __ ] they'll

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.400
scurry around

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.000
i don't know why i still kind of do i

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.120
don't believe in it but for some reason

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.120
when i'm there i'm like oh

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.559
yeah now it's not going to that's not

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:15.840
the time to find that i'm wrong

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:17.200
yeah you got to avoid it yeah that was

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.039
apparently the uh

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:20.559
that's kind of what happened ireland was

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:21.840
kind of doing their thing chilling and

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.840
uh chris or i guess catholicism came

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.640
through and was like all right you

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.400
[ __ ] knock it off

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.480
and just absolutely came through and was

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.400
like here's what we're up to now

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.279
and everyone's like what about the

00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:32.559
fairies and then like shut up that's

00:25:32.559 --> 00:25:35.039
pretty yeah i don't talk about those um

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:36.559
there's an alternative and then this is

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:37.919
because it's still modern today the

00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:40.080
fairy fort which was like a man-made

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.960
ring

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.400
big ring in the field and they put a

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.159
couple of planks down i don't know why

00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:45.679
no one knows why they did it but

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:47.360
apparently if you get rid of those it's

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.720
bad luck too

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.360
and just recently there was a

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.279
famous irish businessman called sean

00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:54.240
quinn

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.080
and he went bankrupt in 2011 and

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.840
everyone says it's because he demolished

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.000
one of these rings still to this day

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.240
really yeah that's what the because he

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.400
it was like he he was building a hotel

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.320
or something and he had to like demolish

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.760
this field and it was like you can't do

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.159
that you can't do that oh no you're

00:26:12.159 --> 00:26:15.279
[ __ ] john and he went

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:17.760
that's hilarious yeah

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.799
so um

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:20.880
any any thoughts on fairies or elves and

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.400
all this type of [ __ ] this this is old

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.640
that's old old school

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.240
yeah that's almost killed no i i don't

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.400
know i never got any kind of again cause

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.159
my my family was like super catholic so

00:26:30.159 --> 00:26:31.440
i didn't like [ __ ] with fairies and

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.799
elves but

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:34.799
the

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:36.159
yeah from what i understand that was

00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:37.840
kind of the lay of the land and even

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.520
after like catholicism came through

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.200
people were like oh yeah yeah for sure

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.039
like body of christ and they'd still go

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:44.799
right on being like yo so about these

00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:46.320
[ __ ] fairies dude

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.320
but i've heard that's never left like

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.440
you know it's funny to hear that's

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.640
actually true

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.080
yeah no it's still it's just one of

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.000
those things that's no one will admit

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.159
they believe in it but when push comes

00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:57.520
to shove you're like

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.159
i don't know

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.480
oh it wasn't it's like the banshees you

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.440
know and jeffrey have a pan she yeah

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.279
apparently i don't have it prepped here

00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:08.720
but like it's like

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.960
a white witch my knowledge that would

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.159
scream in the middle of the night i

00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:13.200
don't know what they did but i know

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.120
they're up to no good but when growing

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.720
up if you hear the screaming it could be

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.880
just some guy around the corner

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.799
yeah or a cat giving birth you're like

00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:22.240
that's the banshee yeah that's a weird

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.440
yeah that's what as my mom always says

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.480
she's like they're in here screaming

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.840
like banshees

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.960
and banshees screaming like banshees

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.720
and so would you say your family's from

they're from but they uh

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.520
i think they were cork in

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.679

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.559
more so and

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:52.400
so there's that's the oldest stuff that

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.960
still kind of rings true today

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.320
and

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.840
i also had i know this is more of a

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.600
catholic thing and then we can get into

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.679
more metallica's

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:03.679
folklore stuff

00:28:03.679 --> 00:28:05.200
this is a catholic thing and i don't

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.799
know if it's everywhere but we grew up

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:08.480
with a thing called the prayer to saint

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.240
anthony have you ever heard of that yeah

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.440
if you got to find something you know

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.080
like for saint anthony or whatever yeah

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:14.960
so

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.640
yeah as far as i know it's like if you

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.799
in dublin if you ever lost something

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:20.159
your mother would straight away go well

00:28:20.159 --> 00:28:21.360
have you said a prayer to saint anthony

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.200
and you go yeah jesus yeah that made it

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.200
that made it overseas my mom was fully

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.640
in like did you pray to saint anthony

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.000
and i'm like no i'm just gonna wait here

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
until you find it because i give a

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.480
[ __ ] give up

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.480
so um for people that don't know the

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.919
prince saint anthony was pretty much

00:28:35.919 --> 00:28:37.760
there was a saint

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.520
and he once

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.679
had a book of

00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:44.320
psalms that you know a book of sam's

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.480
stolen from him and he prayed and then

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.919
it was returned

00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:50.960
to him he was from the town of bologna

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.960
in france i know

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.399
maybe if france or italy i'm guessing

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:55.679
that's italy

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:56.960
probably yeah

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.720
and the pressure anthony the prayer that

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.399
you're supposed to say is tony tony look

00:29:00.399 --> 00:29:02.000
around something's lost and must be

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:02.799
found

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:05.039
i don't know if i ever heard that though

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:07.120
my parents would just say say a prayer

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.480
and i'm like okay

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.840
and you're just like yo anto

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.559
yeah

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:14.000
yeah where the [ __ ] did i put my keys

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.120
yeah that was the thing i'll be like

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.640
dear saint anthony please help me find

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.240
my blah blah blah and then like you just

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.760
say it over and over

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.159
um but yeah it is funny now thinking of

00:29:22.159 --> 00:29:23.760
how like that was just [ __ ] i thought my

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.120
mom did but it's funny thinking about

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.880
how that just got purely transmitted

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.159
from like another place and she just

00:29:28.159 --> 00:29:30.000
came and just kept doing all the same

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.799
stuff it's wild that this was a real guy

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:34.399
and then just

00:29:34.399 --> 00:29:36.480
so many thousands of years later just a

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.720
bunch of people still just like

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.640
calling out his name he's just a dude

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.399
like he's just some dude who just could

00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:44.159
you imagine in like a thousand years

00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:45.760
just people was like

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.840
matt

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.640
matt where are my socks matt

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.080
i got them for you now

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.840
yeah he was apparently a very organized

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.760
man people were like oh he'll find it

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.840
yeah exactly so that still goes down

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.440
today i wasn't sure if that was just an

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.960
irish thing or whatever no that's still

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.960
yeah that still goes on i wonder if i'll

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.480
pass these on you know would you pass

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.520
these things on to your um

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.399
kids

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:11.120
possibly uh i might i might stick with

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.000
the man with a bag for sure the uh

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.919
you know dear saint anthony i don't know

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:18.159
i might i might i don't know i don't

00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:19.600
know what i no the deer said anthony no

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.720
i probably wouldn't because i've kind of

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.120
i don't think i do that anymore yeah um

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.360
man with a bag 100 i mean now that i

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.880
know about fairy circles i'll probably

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.200
avoid them myself now yeah for sure um

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.279
but yeah for the most part i don't

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:33.600
probably some of it i don't know

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.039
the one thing that gets they got passed

00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:36.480
down i always talk to shane about this

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.679
is the uh

00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:39.039
like the irish

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:40.399
scream through the teeth or it's like

00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:41.679
good

00:30:41.679 --> 00:30:43.120
dude

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.039
yeah yeah

00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:47.440
we hide your you tried to hide your true

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.960
emotions yeah yeah

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.559
dude it's so [ __ ] funny yeah that is

00:30:54.559 --> 00:30:56.399
funny i don't know if i've ever realized

00:30:56.399 --> 00:30:57.760
until right this moment but that is

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.320
pretty much how my parents would act

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.200
they're shouting at you but they're

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.440
acting like as if they're not

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.120
yeah yeah there isn't there's a big

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.880
there's a big thing i think uh sigmund

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.200
freud said one time that psychoanalysis

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.440
is absolutely useless on the irish just

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.200
because he was like they're just

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.559
you know he didn't come out and say it

00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:16.080
he's like they're just

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.679
on like they're just on another level of

00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:19.279
just like repression and stupidity and

00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:20.399
there's just

00:31:20.399 --> 00:31:21.760
there's no use of sitting and talking

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.120
though they just sit there and [ __ ]

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.600
that you die

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.600
yeah pretty funny yeah there was a while

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.880
so people

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.880
i know in american irish there is a

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.840
thing where they get very uh

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.679
like there's a lot of anger and stuff in

00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:37.440
the families here and you know people

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.600
always talk about like an irish

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.760
get-together and people are fighting and

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.919
things like that in my experience at

00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:46.640
ireland it seems to be it's almost like

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.640
you wouldn't you wouldn't you'd never

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.240
admit that you're angry you know it's

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.000
not like yeah like oh you'd be

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.519
embarrassed to ever and you're like no

00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:55.200
it's fine like the whole life is your

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.039
whole life is just spent gone no that's

00:31:57.039 --> 00:31:58.559
fine yeah just

00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:00.140
just

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.799
[Laughter]

00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:04.640
you always wonder why why that is it's

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.799

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:19.760
like especially when i when i hear

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.919

00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:24.000

dude like the

00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:34.000

who was like older and telling us like

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.200
you know here's

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.960
here's how i got a job from this place

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.480
and he was telling the story and it was

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.799
like the craziest [ __ ] i've ever heard

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:43.679
um

00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:45.120
but he was like

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.440
so i applied for this job i didn't get

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.840
it i was very upset and i called my

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.519
employer and said hey i'm just like

00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:53.200
really upset and down today about this

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.640
job i didn't get

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.480
i'm gonna need to take a day off and i

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.760
remember thinking like

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.600
what the [ __ ] like you said that out

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.480
loud

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.080
are you serious

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.279
it was just i remember just being like

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:06.080
what the [ __ ] is that i know yeah it

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.960
yeah sometimes i wish i was uh maybe not

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.480
as emotionally stunted like you know

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.080
like sometimes i see people and it seems

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.519
like they're healthier when they're just

00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:14.960
yeah you know things bother them and

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.559
they just say

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:17.840
unless it's like

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.519
i'm just like it's nuts to me when i'm

00:33:19.519 --> 00:33:23.720
hearing i'm just like shut the [ __ ] up

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:26.000
yeah dude that was something i had like

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.120
especially in that school that was

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.399
something i had to learn to kind of like

00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:29.919
just chill out on people especially

00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:31.120
after like when the

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.200
pandemic stuff happened people would

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.279
like do the beginning of class

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.320
just be like

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.679
we're meeting on zoom and they're just

00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:38.720
like

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.399
yeah i'm just really disappointed

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:42.640
because i wanted a graduation ceremony

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.399
and now i won't have one i'm not and it

00:33:44.399 --> 00:33:46.080
was just kind of like

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.720
dude shut the [ __ ] up like we're fine

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.559
this is fine like it's like yeah you

00:33:50.559 --> 00:33:51.840
don't get to sit in your robe and all

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.120
this but it was just

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.039
that kind of is my immediate reaction

00:33:55.039 --> 00:33:56.720
constantly like shut the [ __ ] up and you

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.840
know you would do it to yourself over

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.679
and over it is kind of bad you kind of

00:33:59.679 --> 00:34:01.519
get to the point you're like no i'm fine

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:03.519
yeah it's definitely it's definitely

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:04.840
healthier too

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.919
no but then again maybe you just maybe

00:34:07.919 --> 00:34:09.440
once you grow into a pattern of that

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.800
everything affects you so much that

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.040
you've been becoming you're more hurt

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.879
you know yeah there's a sweet spot for

00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:16.399
sure you can't you just can't be a

00:34:16.399 --> 00:34:18.240
[ __ ] crybaby all the time all day

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.359
every day yeah you're right that's what

00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:21.440
it is describing but yeah he's got to

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.079
find a balance but yeah it's like

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:24.960
you know

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.560
it definitely also can't just be like

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.079
it's fine it's fine no that's good i'm

00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:29.679
fine

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:30.720
yeah because then what happens is then

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.919
one night you end up just putting your

00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:33.760
[ __ ] fist through a

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.839
classic exactly there's no more

00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:37.839
turbocharged like the irish spaz might

00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:40.399
be the most like pressurized and [ __ ]

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:42.879
potent spaz if you were to talk to my

00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:45.280
girl about that it's because i i don't

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.280
bring up anything ever when like she

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.960
annoys me all the time but i never say

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.879
it and then i'll just one day i'll just

00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:53.040
send a [ __ ] smash in a plate it's

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.760
like what's wrong

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.800
with

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.079
all this

00:34:58.079 --> 00:34:59.599
three or four months of me not just

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:01.599

of when i was uh

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.200
like the beginning of me and my wife

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.800

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:18.880
bottle of olive oil and just stained my

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.560

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.040
you're looking for something to smash

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.480
and it's like you pick up your laptop

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.880

you know i kept breaking screens at one

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.040
point the phone itself was like

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.560
the the metal part had become a little

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.920
bit curved so the screen wouldn't

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.680
actually fit on it and then i stopped

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.359
smashing my phone and then like you were

00:35:53.359 --> 00:35:55.520

plastic but it looks like hardwood yeah

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.119
and it put a crack the [ __ ]

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:08.400

anywhere around 2000 maybe 14 phones got

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.960
to a point where he's like i can't

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.079
afford it

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:20.160
yeah back in the day

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.640

dude you couldn't break those things man

00:36:25.359 --> 00:36:27.280
those brick phones yeah yeah they were

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.520
great dude i dropped one one time from

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.359
the third floor of a house when i was

00:36:31.359 --> 00:36:32.800
working for a builder and we were you

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.160

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.680
truck nothing those things wouldn't

[ __ ] break hmm

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.839
yeah but but then listen

00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:44.880
you know all these companies just

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.400
decided like why would we keep making

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.320
things that don't break

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.320
exactly yeah enter the iphone it's like

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.240
dude although this one i have right now

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.400
i i've dropped it in the toilet twice

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.400
still truck iphone do you have a good

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.480
i've i've got like an auto box online

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.480
yeah it's my bot it must be the otterbox

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.359
see that

00:37:01.359 --> 00:37:02.640
that's what i got bro come on man the

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.079
other box is yeah that's it that's the

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:05.520
[ __ ] man that's it that's the one right

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.160
there

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.240
and yeah but the worst thing about apple

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.280
was that they

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.440
someone sued them in france or something

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.599
did you see that it was like they were

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:17.599
pr it was proven that the updates on the

00:37:17.599 --> 00:37:19.280
phone were

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.520
designed to slow down

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.359
older phones so when every time the

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:25.440
phone updates your older phone was

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.640
getting

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.599
worse

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:29.280
and they yeah yeah it's proven that they

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.440
were doing that on purpose and then so

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.960
some guy in france or something sued

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:33.760
them

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.599
and he got like 10 million dollars or

00:37:35.599 --> 00:37:36.560
something

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.320
what and yeah but then that was like it

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.240
but they was like they've made billions

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.760
on this exactly it's like yeah i'll do

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.240
that every day i could pay that but oh

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.599
yeah and i think once you sue someone

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:47.040
once it's like

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.320
everyone else can't sue them i don't

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.000
know what way the world's work but

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.520
everyone can't sue you for the same

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.880
thing somehow

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.160
no i i could see that i mean that's what

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.400
the drug companies do they make a drug

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.320
and they sell like billions of dollars

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.160
worth of it and then likes like you know

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.079
300 people

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:04.079
like stop breathing and die and then

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:05.520
they just pay out like two million bucks

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.200
and they're like all right

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.119
we're good call it even like a fight

00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:10.960
club wasn't that kind of a similar thing

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.720
in fight club where they said that

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.920
rather than

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.440
if they sell a car

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.440
and they have to

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.800
there's there's a fault in the car

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.560
rather than the cost of bringing all the

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.640
cars back in they just let people die

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.040
and then they'll get off a thing

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.480
i'm sure that happens all the time and

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.599
none of us know

00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:28.720
yeah it's just cheaper it's like well

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.839
[ __ ] it we'll just do this you know

00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:31.440
let's pay out and

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.280
but yeah [ __ ] up

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.079
yeah

00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:35.200
well

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.400
is that kind of what's going on with

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.640
covert now too right it's like they're

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.920
stopping everything but it's only

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.839
because like

00:38:41.839 --> 00:38:43.520
you know

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.480
they don't have enough room in the

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.920
hospitals right they kind of don't it's

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.200
not i don't think they people really

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.640
care if people live or not it's just

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.160
like it's just a burden

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.520
yeah i mean dude it's definitely one of

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.880
those things where it's like you know

00:38:55.119 --> 00:38:56.560
as soon as the government's concerned

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.839
about your health and well-being i'm

00:38:57.839 --> 00:39:01.200
always kind of curious because it's like

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.839
just i think like six or seven years ago

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:05.839
we you know the food pyramid in america

00:39:05.839 --> 00:39:07.680
maybe it was ten years ago the food

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.440
pyramid here was like

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.119
the you're supposed to eat like six to

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:13.359
eight servings of bread every day yeah i

00:39:13.359 --> 00:39:15.520
know yeah it's funny yeah like fat and

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.359
they had they had [ __ ] candy on there

00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:19.599
on the top and it was just kind of like

00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:21.280
that's [ __ ] weird yeah and then it

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.359
was like and then you know let's say

00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:25.599
five years ago they were selling what

00:39:25.599 --> 00:39:27.839
was essentially heroin with an oxycontin

00:39:27.839 --> 00:39:29.760
legally to people which they [ __ ]

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.800
knew what that was you're telling me

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.640
like a pharmacist

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.359
uh like a chemist pharmacist guy yeah

00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:36.960
wasn't looking at that being like dude

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.920
this is exactly like heroin

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.359
it was like okay so there was the drug

00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:42.720
companies now who are like super

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.800
concerned about us than saving us

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.040
and yet i i am always suspicious i think

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.000
it's really one of those things where

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.200
it's like whenever it's financially

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.359
feasible they'll do it and when it's not

00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:54.480
it's like you know well [ __ ] that thing

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.280
yeah for sure the the food pyramid is a

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.960
funny one where

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.720
there's so much [ __ ] though dude that

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.160
they just tell you and you kind of go

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.160
you know i'm not gonna i'm not gonna

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.359
research this

00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:07.599
they just tell your stuff well dude i

00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:09.200
mean at the time of the you know it was

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.640
10 years ago

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.040
like they were like conceptualizing the

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.359
internet they had they're designing like

00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:17.280
stealth bombers and drones and like

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.480
you're mean to tell me they didn't

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.079
figure out like the nutritional science

00:40:20.079 --> 00:40:22.240
behind like excessive bread consumption

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.599
they're just like you listen that's a

00:40:23.599 --> 00:40:25.760
good the good foundation of any diet is

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.880
just bread

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.040
it's just just tons of bread

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.359
carbs yeah just spaghetti and

00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:34.240
it was it was bread spaghetti rice

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.400
and then it was like fruits or then it

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.240
was meat and fruits and vegetables i'm

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.520
almost positive i'm gonna look that up

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.680
man i think it was bread meat yeah

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.280
fruits and vegetables

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.599
like eggs and cheese and dairy and then

00:40:45.599 --> 00:40:47.440
i think it was like candy oils and

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.280
sweets and it's like that's yeah that's

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.040
crazy they always had that like cartoon

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.119
of like a chocolate bar you know yeah

00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:54.880
yeah sure there was probably some

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.119
lobbying going on between hershey's and

00:40:57.119 --> 00:40:58.560
it was like you get a [ __ ] chocolate

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.480
bar on that [ __ ] board

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.079
dude it was i mean it absolutely was it

00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:04.240
was the weed farmers dairy farmers and

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.680
then you know obviously the livestock

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.960
and all that but

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.040
yeah dude it's uh it was like did you

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.280
grow up with that with milk too

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.880
we used to just have advertisements for

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.839
milk

00:41:13.839 --> 00:41:16.319
no particular brand just said like milk

00:41:16.319 --> 00:41:18.800
it's really good for you your bones

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.720

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.200
so in ireland in ireland we had this

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.359
commercial and it was just a generic

00:41:29.359 --> 00:41:30.880
milk brought to you by the farmers

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.359
association and the song was those bones

00:41:33.359 --> 00:41:36.079
those bones need calcium those bones

00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:38.640

[ __ ]

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.520
[ __ ] diarrhea

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.960
yeah

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.960
everyone was [ __ ] their lungs

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.160
yeah but that's that's why i get like

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.520
especially during the covet stuff you

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.200
know

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.480
it's like that was my my brother was

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.599
saying that he was like you know all of

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:11.680
a sudden everybody who was eating like

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.280
four donuts a day and drinking like a

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.440
pack of gatorade are now like worried

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.720
about their health and you know it's

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.000
like

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:18.800
which

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.240
obviously people should you know not get

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.160
sick and try not to but it it's also one

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.200
of those things where like once the

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.800
shit's over people go right back to

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.280
their [ __ ] and dude even like i was

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.040
saying uh because a lot of people are

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.640
like i'm not afraid of this you know and

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.560
it's like okay 100 i could see why you

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.079
know i'm not really that i'm not really

00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:36.000
afraid of it either but it's also like

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.240
dude go into walmart especially the

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.400
walmart near my parents house it's like

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.960
seven out of ten people there are like

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.720
dysfunctionally obese not even just a

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.119
little chubby like yeah like so fat that

00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:49.440
like walking is almost off the table for

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.280
sure yeah but then you start to look at

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.720
if you're that person and ever you know

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.079
you're in that network where like the

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:56.240
most of the people you know are

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.480
somewhat dysfunctionally obese or like

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.839
weirdly skinny which kind of it's either

00:42:59.839 --> 00:43:02.240
like one of the other yeah um dude that

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.280
would tear that would be [ __ ]

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.240
terrifying yeah american has huge

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.079
extremes of like the healthiest people

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:09.680
and then just on the other side of that

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.720
it's just a huge fat [ __ ] yeah what's

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.960
the fat what's obesity like in ireland

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.160
it's not too bad it's getting worse

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.520
everywhere else is getting worse around

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.880
the world as they change things but it's

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.119
not it's not like america is just the

00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:24.000
[ __ ] gold standards of

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.960
like

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.880
there's no such thing as like a mobility

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.880
scooter or event like that in ireland

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.319
really yeah that's the worst thing i

00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:31.520
think i've

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.800
told by like a doctor that's like the

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.560
worst thing you can do once you give

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.880
someone like a scooter they're [ __ ]

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.160
because at least before they were

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.920
wobbling around the place now that's

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.680
right yeah they're just that's it there

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.000
go my legs that's a sad that's a it's

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.359
almost a mental illness isn't it where

00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:46.640
you just go all right i don't need my

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.079
legs [ __ ] that

00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:49.680
yeah imagine looking at a lot of people

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.040
just walking around and you're just

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.680
going no way no way

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.480
that's not for me that's just not

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.160
i've been there done that

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.280
yeah yeah

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.520
i mean yeah i mean you know it's like

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.359
rude i guess and i people it's really

00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:04.560
impolite now they're trying to push that

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.760
as another thing where it's like you

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.839
that's you know that's you can't make

00:44:07.839 --> 00:44:09.200
fun of that you know and it's like dude

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.359
i mean it [ __ ] sucks i was chubby

00:44:11.359 --> 00:44:12.800
growing up and i you know it got kind of

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.079
teased out of me

00:44:14.079 --> 00:44:16.079
um but yeah there's a whole other level

00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:18.160
of that where people get like and again

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.119
though it's one of those things where

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:21.119
like if you don't have access to like

00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:22.400
information or like

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.160
be able to look at things for yourself

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.680
like like a lot of times too i would go

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.400
on

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.720
uh when i work on the construction sites

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.480
yeah dude i would bring like vegetables

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.839
vegetables to what for like my lunch

people think what the [ __ ] is that and

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:37.359
just like go every day i'd watch guys

00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:39.280
eat like four hot dogs off a lunch truck

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.200
and be like oh yeah and just and just

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.880
have no idea i'd look at them like dude

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.400
that's [ __ ] crazy that's what you eat

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.520
every day they're like what are you

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.920
talking about hot dog yeah yeah yeah

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.920
those people who just legitimately don't

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.680
you know they see the food pyramid they

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.800
don't even know if they look at that but

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.720
it's just they just go into walmart grab

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.319
like the stuff that tastes the best and

00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:57.680
they just eat as much as humanly

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.040
possible of it and then become addicted

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.400
to it and it's like

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.560
just a wrap and if if everyone around

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.480
you is also a big [ __ ]

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.560
toby you look alright you look at them

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.680
what's there's always someone fatter

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.280
than you i think people still go i'm not

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.480
that guy

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.640
yeah well also dude i've i've seen it

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.480
before work it's into like

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.400
entire family lines where it's like your

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.240
parents just completely the wheels went

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.680
off the wagon in terms of what they're

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.440
eating and then they have kids and like

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.119
they just from the moment they're born

00:45:23.119 --> 00:45:25.520
it's just like you know huge vats of

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.599
count chocula and all this stuff and you

00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:29.280
just don't have a chance dude

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.880
luckily my mom was kind of a health nut

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:31.599
but

00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:33.520
it's like i could see you know if that's

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.599
all you've ever known got it getting off

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:37.920
of that stuff later on [ __ ] hard your

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.680
whole brain got wired around eating

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.359
essentially candy all day every day

00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:42.800
you're just addicted to sugar there

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.800
wasn't a thing because we grew up kind

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.599
of poor relatively in the 90s you know

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:48.400
so

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.640
um there was no such thing as eating out

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.319
but when we grew when i was a kid it was

00:45:52.319 --> 00:45:54.079
mcdonald's was like the tree you know it

00:45:54.079 --> 00:45:55.760
was like this big tree where it was like

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.920
once a month on the like the last friday

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.200
of every month you were allowed you and

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.240
your friends were going to mcdonald's

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.079
and it was like this big [ __ ]

00:46:02.079 --> 00:46:04.319
thing but now it's just like mcdonald's

00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:06.640
is just a com passing thing that's why

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.920
oh yeah maybe i don't know if that was

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.240
always like that in america also but it

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.240
feels like people just have that all the

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.560
time for lunch yeah no i think you're

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.160
right though when i was younger

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.400
they uh that's my parents would get all

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.160
like that was a kind of like friday was

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.839
a pizza night kind of set up for the

00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:22.880
most part

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.040
and then like yeah mcdonald's was a

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.960
thing that like if like our cousins were

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.400
over or something or like you know like

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.920
say like my mom and her sister was there

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.839
we were like that was like a kind of

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:33.680
like a once every couple months treat

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.040
the same thing but yeah now it's like

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.319
people i know my one cousin ate

00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:37.599
mcdonald's

00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:39.839
uh i think almost like every day he was

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:41.359
eating the mcdonald's breakfast almost

00:46:41.359 --> 00:46:43.760
every day for i think like a year or so

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.680
yeah that's crazy man i worked at

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.040
mcdonald's and i didn't even eat it

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.119
every day that's really yeah it was like

00:46:49.119 --> 00:46:51.200
my first real job and there's just you

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.880
you know he was thinking of grease and

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.839
stuff

00:46:53.839 --> 00:46:55.920
yeah he would he would buy like two

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.359
baconators or whatever nothing was

00:46:57.359 --> 00:46:58.800
wendy's he would buy like two of the

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.079
mcgriddles whatever they were the

00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:01.839
mcdonald's breakfast sandwich he would

00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:03.359
eat one and then throw another one on

00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:04.720
his dashboard and like at like 10

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.960
o'clock he'd pull it off and just eat it

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.680
[ __ ] it does it does real though

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.960
it's so [ __ ] good yeah that's the

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.400
issue with it too it's like it's just so

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.839
[ __ ] good even when i'm bad mountain

00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:16.880
right now i'm just like oh man and

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.680
mcgriddle would [ __ ] be sick

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.040
that's the power of the of the

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.880
mcdonald's whatever's in that [ __ ]

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.400
well there's also like with with

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.240
mcdonald's and food like that they have

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.480
food scientists who

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.240
create kind of like artificial flavor

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.400
profiles that aren't found in in natural

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.640
ingredients oh wow so there's this idea

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.359
called super super normal stimuli which

00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:39.200
are like a thing that it doesn't exist

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.640
in nature that

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.000
hooks the part of your brain that would

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.359
be attracted to it naturally so there

00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:44.960
was like a um

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.400
the one experiment they did with with

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.319
butterflies where they take

00:47:48.319 --> 00:47:49.680
so like the male butterflies are

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.760
attracted to like the deeper shade of

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.240
purple the female is yeah the more the

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.440
butter the male butterflies are

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.800
attracted to them and the scientists

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.520
would

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.880
create a shade of purple that was just

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.560
like a piece of paper and hold it like a

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.079
little further away and the male

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:03.680
butterflies would fly right past the

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.599
female butterflies and just like cling

00:48:05.599 --> 00:48:07.599
to the sheet of paper and just die

00:48:07.599 --> 00:48:09.440
yes

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.200
your biology can get hijacked if people

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.720
kind of tinker with the right stuff yeah

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:13.839
that's kind of that's what's happening

00:48:13.839 --> 00:48:16.000
right now biology is getting hijacked

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.720
right yeah dude with [ __ ] your phone

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.359
just the [ __ ] dude exactly the phone

00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:23.200
is just [ __ ] flashing in your face

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.720
all day it's

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.000
nature dude do you remember when

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.680
smartphones came out

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.240
uh yeah yeah i remember seeing them like

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.680
oh they look kind of cool then like i

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.680
got it i remember thinking like man i

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.440
really like this thing like i remember

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.040
like i couldn't put it down i was like

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.359
this is like i like i felt cool i'd pull

00:48:39.359 --> 00:48:41.040
it out it was like yeah when i'd hit a

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.640
button it would vibrate and i'm like oh

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.000
that's kind of cool and i like you know

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.280
when i touch the screen and do all this

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.079
stuff

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:48.559
yeah and it's dude i didn't think it's

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:50.400
when i picked one of those up i didn't i

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.760
there was no

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.280
i had no conception of the fact that

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.079
like it was slowly kind of taking up my

00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:58.559
my kind of time and attention for sure

00:48:58.559 --> 00:49:00.240
ten years later i was like oh yeah i do

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.680
look at this thing [ __ ] [ __ ] lie i

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.000
look at mine all the time all the time

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.160
and i know it's i'm heavily addicted to

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.839
it it's just something i gotta [ __ ]

00:49:07.839 --> 00:49:09.440
break the curse i gotta just throw it

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.119
throw it away like the ring in lord of

00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:14.319
the rings [ __ ] throw it yeah

00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:15.599
i'm always trying to think like dude i

00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:17.040
always say too if i didn't do like

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.520
podcasting or like comedy i could easily

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.960
just get by with having like a flip

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.880
phone but you know maybe not but it's

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.160
it's hard especially like you know i

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.680
have ins i just go on instagram to like

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.680
check messages and stuff yes but every

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.800
now and again i'll catch myself i'll

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.760
start looking through it and i'm like

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.440
dude i think if you were back if you

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.559
were back in the construction site i

00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:34.640
think it's a lot easier although i had

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.400
jobs where you had to have a like

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.480
bartender where they you know you had to

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.640
have a smartphone in order to use like

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.240
an app for your schedule and [ __ ] like

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.160
that so it's like harder and harder yeah

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.960
you almost do yeah i i was like

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.559
half entertaining the idea of getting a

00:49:48.559 --> 00:49:51.119
flip phone but i'm like yeah as soon as

00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:52.400
i go to drive somewhere i'm instantly

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.559
going to be lost someone yes i know i

00:49:54.559 --> 00:49:56.720
know but yeah the thing i got out of is

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.200
as soon as i wake up i don't like sit

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.960
and check my like i go do something else

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.640
first do you i'll pick my phone i'll

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.920
make see if anyone texted me i'll just

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.319
see you know respond but if not i look

00:50:06.319 --> 00:50:07.760
at my just i don't open it i just look

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.920
at it nobody texts me i put it away and

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.440
i go downstairs and like do a bunch of

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.119
stuff first and then i could get to it

00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:14.800
later but i feel like if you can break

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.720
that morning like phone and bed cycle

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.280
it's a lot easier i yeah

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.040
sometimes i'll delete the apps and then

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.960
what will happen is

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.960
i'm i end up looking for the apps not

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.960
even just subconsciously i'm just i open

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.280
my phone and i can see myself like my

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.200
fingers are just looking for

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.400
instagram even though it's not on the

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.920
app anymore and then i go what am i

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.760
doing i'm just flicking i'm opening

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.160
weird [ __ ] apps and [ __ ] wow dude

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.839
exactly yeah yeah i started i started

00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:40.880
doing the same thing i started like

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.480
checking the weather compulsively i'll

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.760
delete all the other apps and i'll be

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.359
like wait what's the weather again i

00:50:45.359 --> 00:50:46.559
think you just start getting addicted to

00:50:46.559 --> 00:50:48.720
the glow yeah of the screen after like

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.000
let me just look at do you ever do the

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.440
black and white thing

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.359
yeah i did that for a while i have the

00:50:53.359 --> 00:50:55.280
set in here yeah yeah yeah that actually

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.400
works pretty well i think i don't know

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.000
why i took mine back to color but i

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.680
remember i had that like that for months

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.040
and it was actually i thought it worked

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.359
really well it works really well and for

00:51:03.359 --> 00:51:04.720
people that don't know there's a setting

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.720
in your iphone you can have it so that

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.400
it's just black and white and if you try

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.760
to go on instagram instagram is the most

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.119
disgusting thing in the world if it's

00:51:11.119 --> 00:51:12.079
all in black and white you're just like

00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:14.559
oh get this away the only issue is so

00:51:14.559 --> 00:51:16.400
easy to change them back that then it's

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.000
just you change it back once because you

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.359
might be using google maps when you're

00:51:19.359 --> 00:51:20.960
driving and then you just never change

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.720
it back that's what i think i was taking

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.559
like a screen recording to like use in

00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:25.920
like an editing thing or something or

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.440
just like to post somewhere and i think

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.880
it was in black and white and then i was

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.160
like [ __ ] but i think i'm like you know

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:30.960
what i think i'm actually going to put

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.559
mine back in black and white remember

00:51:32.559 --> 00:51:33.839
that help big time i would just look at

00:51:33.839 --> 00:51:35.119
it all right let's do it let's check

00:51:35.119 --> 00:51:38.880
