00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.279
hell yeah

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:16.720
yeah yesterday uh yesterday on the page

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.840
i was laying out my theory my uh this

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.039
was my

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:22.720
this was a main this was a big thing for

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.240
me i figured out

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.480
why i didn't like stand up for so long

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.520
and it has to do with a thing that i've

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.200
i've coined a term called satanic

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.720
self-confidence where

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.840
you meet a lot of the

00:25:35.919 --> 00:25:38.320
a lot of the should you ever like work

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.600
with a headliner and they're just you

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.640
know they're selling out they're doing

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.080
well and they're just miserable as [ __ ]

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.600
and they're like oh yeah features who

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.440
are back there like i know this guy i

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.600
know this guy too

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.279
it's all i was dealing with i was like

00:25:49.279 --> 00:25:50.640
just do it when i just started like

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.480
featuring and hosting and healing him

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.720
it was just like i need [ __ ] you know

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.159
i think i first opened for like heather

00:25:56.159 --> 00:25:57.120
mcdonald

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.520
brad trackman's the [ __ ] feature both

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.320
are [ __ ] safe

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.039
both are clearly satanic and it's just

00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:04.480
like heather mcdonald's giving me all

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.320
these crazy [ __ ] credits to remember

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:06.640
and

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.480
brad trackman's like no i got the same

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.320
manager the

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.440
and they're just [ __ ] having this

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.320
weird battle that was my uh

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.400
the worst green room ever to be in it

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.760
was dude it was [ __ ] hell but that

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.360
was my theory

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.120
that the con it's like this is this

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.720
level of

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.080
it's a level of confidence that you need

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.080
to it's not like a self thing where

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.760
you're like i'm just i'm the person you

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.200
need to just be

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.799
looking down you have to be a part in

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:35.039
your mind yeah that's crazy people are

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:36.559
people who are

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:38.240
people who are like crazy about credits

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.159
and [ __ ] like that also just like

00:26:40.159 --> 00:26:42.720
yeah you can't help but that's it that's

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.240
the eye of sauron

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.080
yeah we're talking about satanic

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.440
self-confidence and how

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.360
it's it's credit credit hounds being

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.080
like what are your credits

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.640
and it's what's crazy too is that it's

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.919
when you're in that situation when

00:26:55.919 --> 00:26:57.360
you're in that room it's like it's hard

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.320
not to be like wait am i these people

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.440
that was my problem i like these two i

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.640
want a feature

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.400

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.720
next thing like yeah am i just

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:12.240
brad trackman is that what is that my

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.200
future

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.320
well i'm telling you we all have it's

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.919
the shadow we all have it but it was

00:27:15.919 --> 00:27:17.679
funny i was talking to spud today

00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:21.200
and spud was like spud spud was talking

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.360
about he hates when comedians talk about

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.039
just doing comedy and they're like oh my

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:25.600
craft

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.120
blah blah and spud's like dude i'm a

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.279
master painter if i were to walk around

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:30.000
and be like

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.440
looking at people who didn't paint

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.640
houses and be like they just don't

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.640
understand dude what i can do

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.320
it's like people like shut the [ __ ] up

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.000
for some reason comedians are like man

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.360
yeah i mean you just don't understand

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.080
the scene

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.360
he's like what the [ __ ] scene are you

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.200
talking about imagine if i was like

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.120
the delaware county painting scene

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.720
people like shut the [ __ ] up

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.440
well people do love that they do love

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.840
that stuff what

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.919
they love like the artist tutorial kind

00:27:57.919 --> 00:27:59.919
of

00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:02.799
some some do some do i mean maybe if you

00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:04.320
had a painting podcast

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.080
it might be appropriate but that's

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.559
that's my i think because stand-up

00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:11.600
requires a job that requires a gazillion

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.039
people to be there when you do it well

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:14.320
they praise you

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.159
so if there was a if you painted that

00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:17.520
you're saying like an artist really

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.399
painting you know a

00:28:18.399 --> 00:28:20.080
zillion people bought it or whatever it

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.840
is the same thing it is funny though

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.080
it is a funny way to think about it just

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.840
to be a youtuber i listened to

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.679

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:29.919

00:28:36.159 --> 00:28:38.000
i mean i gotta get into that i gotta say

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.360
next level yeah

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.520

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.799
i had to go downstairs and read short

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:38.399
stories by myself for a while

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.120
i don't think she's these [ __ ]

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.200
aviators were getting hot

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.120

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.240

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.279
you're gonna get some nice color

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:50.240
tomorrow how did that yeah that's a long

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.600
that's a good session how long were you

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.559
out there for

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:54.159
no that was that was nothing the other

00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:55.600
day i [ __ ] laid out

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.600
i thought it'd be a decent idea idea to

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.440
get oh burnt

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.480
dude my belly got crushed itchy i was up

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.880
there shirtless

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.640
yeah it's late in the sun i've never

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.480
laid in the sun like ever yeah

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.679
it's my belly and underneath my tits

00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:13.919
haven't seen the sun in

00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:17.519
forever yeah yeah dude i do uh destroyed

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:19.840
that outside with my little roof deck i

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.039
as soon as it gets like a little bit

00:33:21.039 --> 00:33:22.799
warm i'll give myself like dude 10

00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:24.559
minute increments starting out

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:25.760
because you're supposed to absorb

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.640
vitamin d i think it's like sick

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.720
if your body is supposed to be exposed

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.240
to the sun to get then

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.919
i think it's like 50 of your body for 20

00:33:33.919 --> 00:33:35.200
minutes a day that's how you absorb

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.720
enough vitamin d

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.240
so you've got it cdc is like go

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:40.960
shirtless

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.799
you gotta doesn't that depend on your

00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:44.640
like complexion yeah if you're black you

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.360
need even more

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.679
uh sun time because the melanin blocks

00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:48.559
the sun out

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:51.519
luckily the cdc would tell me you need

00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:53.679
to keep your shirt on you will die

00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:56.640
yeah you will get skin cancer shortly

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.159
every couple days stick your hand out

00:33:58.159 --> 00:33:59.440

self-reflective there which is kind of

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.359
funny

like i'm just going to sit here and

watch my owners but is there anything

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.760
more infuriating

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.319
than recommending to a dog brain we

00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:36.720
watch the departed again

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.720

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.280
it was freezing cold but he got in first

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.079
and was like

00:43:58.079 --> 00:44:01.200
it's not bad and i jumped there

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.960
as soon as i as soon as i re-emerged i

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.280
was like it's horrible you [ __ ] liar

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.200
what was the bottom like of the of the

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.800
lake dude

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.280
it was like an old river system yeah it

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.720
was full it was so deep

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.960
dude 10 feet off of the shoreline it was

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.560
like 30 feet deep

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.400
yeah that's [ __ ] crazy this is like

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.240
100 feet deep out in the middle right

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.920
there's no there's no man-made then

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.680
there's no man-made no it is no it

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.960
wasn't it was

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.680
it was like they damned a river so like

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.200
it'd be like if you you know obviously

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.200
not the same but if you dammed the grand

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:31.920
canyon how

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.000
deep the center would be you're saying

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.440
to be the same as damning the grand

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.960
canyon

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.240
no i think he actually started that

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.079
i have no i have no consent i'm like i

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.520
wouldn't believe you i'm like okay

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.280
no you know it's like the river has worn

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.960
through like a mountain range for

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.839
oh forever and then yeah and then they

00:44:49.839 --> 00:44:50.960
damn it so it's like

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.079
where the river was going it's like

00:44:54.079 --> 00:44:56.400
crazy who knows where it is dude where

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.000
it's going it's very scary

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.240
it gets in deep water it's very scary

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.800
yeah river dude

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.640
there's definitely some big there's big

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.000
crocs floating around there's a big

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.520
catfish underneath there

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.160
that's a legend some fresh water kyla

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.240
was like afraid of the boat

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.599
so taking her out on the water was a uh

00:45:15.599 --> 00:45:17.599
it was a task she it was like putting a

00:45:17.599 --> 00:45:20.480
kid putting a cat in a car

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.560
it was just non-stop just like just

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.599
[ __ ] sit down

00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:26.560
just [ __ ] relax the whole time like

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.000
are we going back yet yeah what's out

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.440
here in this water what's going on here

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.880
and i kept down and there was a catfish

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:31.359
that was

00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:32.640
a six foot catfish

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.359
[Laughter]

00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:38.400
and it was genuinely scaring her the six

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.480
foot catfish was gonna get her yeah

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.480
yeah how does she think the catfish is

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.240
gonna jump up and stinger and jump back

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:44.960
in

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:48.800
maybe there wasn't a lot i mean it was

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.079
just it would have jumped out and like

00:45:50.079 --> 00:45:51.520
knocked her out with this big body and

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.000
fell back

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.079
she has a lot of she has a lot of fears

00:45:58.079 --> 00:45:59.359
i feel like that don't necessarily have

00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:01.200
like a chain of reasoning behind them

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.640
it's just like uh

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.400
yeah it's just dude i wouldn't say that

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.520
about my friend's girlfriend but go

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.520
ahead

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.040
that's kind of [ __ ] up dude beezer's

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.800
gonna [ __ ] you up for that i don't think

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.160
so

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.960
we talked about it in the car yeah i i

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:15.760
literally

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.079
i literally would get in fights in front

00:46:18.079 --> 00:46:20.319
of in front of beezer with kyla like

00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:22.560
she and i will get in arguments yeah and

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.119
beezer will just be like

00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:28.800
[ __ ] both you shut the [ __ ] off

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.359
dude i was it's so funny nobody would

00:46:31.359 --> 00:46:32.160
ever allow that

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.800
no like if i got like a fight with

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.000
brittany in front of you you'd be

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.160
you'd be like you need to stop just good

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.359
please please

00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:40.960
that is that's that would be so

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.880
uncomfortable oh yeah

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.960
he'll just but me and kyle are very

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:45.920
close so

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.400
that's true too isn't that crazy no she

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.359
talks a lot of [ __ ]

00:46:49.359 --> 00:46:52.079
and you know so do i so yeah you guys

00:46:52.079 --> 00:46:52.400
are

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.520
the last thing i remember you already

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.119
missed a long time ago but about just

00:46:55.119 --> 00:46:56.800
like some sport it was the funniest oh

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.319
my god dude she was trying to tell

00:46:58.319 --> 00:47:01.119
she this bothered me it still bothers me

00:47:01.119 --> 00:47:01.599
you

00:47:01.599 --> 00:47:03.839
even mentioning it right now she was

00:47:03.839 --> 00:47:05.200
trying to say that hockey players were

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.200
the most athletic

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.280
was the most athletic sport yeah they

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.119
were the most athletic people

00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:15.280
um and uh it it really fired me up

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.800
yeah what was your what was your who was

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.000
the most athletic who are you talking

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.560
about

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.000
who did you say was a mess i mean you

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.319
could say there's two arguments it's mba

00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:23.680
or nfl

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.920
nfl like a defensive back in the nfl

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.559
like he sprints backwards faster than

00:47:28.559 --> 00:47:30.640
a wide receiver running for like it's

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.880
it's crazy what those guys do

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:36.400
um i mean defense defensive ends

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.599
are like six eight and fast

00:47:39.599 --> 00:47:41.680
and strong as [ __ ] like i mean yeah you

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.040
can imagine lucky hockey's a bunch of

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:43.760
white dudes

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.559
that are skating yeah don't get me wrong

00:47:46.559 --> 00:47:47.839
it's it's clearly an athlete it's

00:47:47.839 --> 00:47:49.440
incredibly athletic and the hand-eye

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.960
coordination is incredible

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.359
but there's there's a reason it's a

00:47:53.359 --> 00:47:54.400
white guy sport

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.400
yeah if you were to do like strength you

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.599
could really break it down in like

00:47:57.599 --> 00:47:59.520
strength agility different things speed

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.720
and yeah i mean there's

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.640
that was it that's all i was saying yeah

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.240
if you look at some of these like

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.640
combine numbers i'm sure that an nhl

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.720
draft has like numbers too but it's like

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.440
they'll be like a 350 pound offensive

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.359
lineman who's got like a 32 inch

00:48:13.359 --> 00:48:14.240
vertical

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.559
it's like yeah and then i mean just

00:48:16.559 --> 00:48:18.000
during that during that draft they were

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.359
showing some of those offensive linemen

00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:20.400
that got drafted

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.640
that were running the one guy was 350

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.200
pounds and ran a five second 40.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.520
it's it's impossible how dude that's a

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.839
350 pound dude that's as fast as

00:48:29.839 --> 00:48:31.440
you guys that's how that's about what

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.040
you guys would run right now yeah

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.839
five what like a five second 40. that's

00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:36.960
probably i'll take that and then we

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.780
would run it thank you

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.680
[Laughter]

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.440
yeah i'm trying i don't know i know how

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.200
dudes get with the being fast which is

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:43.680
funny

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.839
i got when i was when i was my at my

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:47.599
fastest i think i was like

00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:49.920
four or five i think i was no you were

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:50.800
never running

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:54.160
four or five o'clock six i just tried to

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.599
run before this podcast

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:57.520
oh i never did like a laser guided one

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.440
or whatever yeah you could

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.440
a four five a four or five is genuinely

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.040
like what a lot of nfl running back and

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.480
wider steve is really yeah that's super

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.119
fast i think

00:49:05.119 --> 00:49:07.359
well they're also they're all so [ __ ]

00:49:07.359 --> 00:49:08.559
super tall

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:10.319
doesn't matter that would only help you

00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:12.079
run faster

00:49:12.079 --> 00:49:13.760
yeah i uh i don't know because it takes

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.480
it takes a while to get up and going

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.240
chris you're not the slowest part of the

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.520
40 like ezekiel elliott

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.520
where does he run i don't know i think

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.119
his is actually fast i think he might

00:49:25.119 --> 00:49:26.079
run a 4-4

00:49:26.079 --> 00:49:28.160
you're not a 10th of a second slower

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.280
than ezekiel

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.480
yeah i think i ran in high school i was

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.640
like a five day my heyday

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.319
five two i think i bro i think i hit the

00:49:36.319 --> 00:49:37.359
five and a half but i gotta throw a

00:49:37.359 --> 00:49:38.920
football over the mountains huh chris

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.119
[Laughter]

00:49:43.119 --> 00:49:44.800
yeah i just i tried i've been trying to

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.800
like i don't feel like doing exercise in

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.720
my house i'm gonna start running

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.680
dude i can make it through like the guts

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.319
of one

00:49:52.319 --> 00:49:54.319
three-minute song and i'm just like abs

my like shoulders are in pain i'm just

00:49:56.079 --> 00:49:56.880
like holy yeah

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.880
here's here's according to a five-year

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.960
nfl combine record report

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.960
uh wide receivers and corners had the

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.920
fastest average time at four four eight

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.520
uh followed by running back said four

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.280
four nine so literally you're saying you

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.000
run the average nfl

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.640
running back 40. i can see it i think

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.160
it's time to walk it back

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.839
you're getting hammered i said i said

00:50:17.839 --> 00:50:20.000
four five four six

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.599
we gotta start we gotta we should take

00:50:21.599 --> 00:50:23.359
it myself did my

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:27.839
i would run it probably five five yeah

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.839
i wouldn't finish i may not finish

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.640
i may walk off the course dude i did a

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.520
uh

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.359
oh my god when britney was training for

00:50:37.359 --> 00:50:39.200
her like physical thing for the police

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.640
academy i did

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.400
the police test and at one point we did

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.480
a 200 meter sprint and i had an apple

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.200
watch

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.680
my heart rate broke like 200 beats per

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.240
minute

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.040
it went up so high the first time i

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.119
sprinted 200 meters i was like in like a

00:50:53.119 --> 00:50:55.359
dangerous level like a dangerous range

00:50:55.359 --> 00:50:58.480
dude i ran up to 40 yeah at west

00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.359
virginia's

00:50:59.359 --> 00:51:01.599
at the combine this high school combine

00:51:01.599 --> 00:51:02.960
at west virginia

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.280
on the field there i ran a i think it

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.400
was a either a

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:10.480
i think it was a five nine

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.520
with pads no just straight up

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.720
regular and i was that was

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.359
that's like i got done i think i ran a

00:51:19.359 --> 00:51:20.480
six

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.760
one the first time and the guy was like

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.680
it was one of the players that was that

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.119
went to west virginia that was doing the

00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:27.599
times

00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:29.760
and when i ran it he was like jesus

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.240
christ

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.440
i got back and ran like a five nine or a

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.880
five eight and i was like

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:40.640
pretty good that's pretty good

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.520
that's funny they're like do it again

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.440
yeah you you ran it twice regardless but

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.200
then in the one on ones i dominated bro

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.400
that was big

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.079
obviously just passed by i mean i'm i'm

00:51:50.079 --> 00:51:51.680
more on the field guy

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.119
tough to get around i will say i try to

00:51:53.119 --> 00:51:54.319
get around you on the beach at one time

00:51:54.319 --> 00:51:55.760
you're you definitely not tough to get

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.400
around

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.760
but you're not getting into the second

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.760
level is that what you're saying but the

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.880
the the amount that the 40 time i ran

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:03.520
there

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.079
is so slow that it would it would

00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:06.880
prevent me from

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.119
having any type of career in football

00:52:09.119 --> 00:52:10.160
really really

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.520
yeah that's that i mean that's scary

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.280
that's kicker that's as slow as it

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.880
possibly gets so that guy clocked you in

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.319
and was like you know chris o'connor bud

00:52:16.319 --> 00:52:19.839
get back there

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.200
you think you can run a four five dude

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.640
beezer was in front of you in that race

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.680
at the beach

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.839
not true i heard beezer had some jets

00:52:25.839 --> 00:52:27.760
dude beezer did have some jets i was

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.520
surprised both of them were way more

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:33.839
i was shocked at beezer's jets

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.400
i think you were too chris i was i

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.839
almost i almost pulled both my

00:52:37.839 --> 00:52:38.880
hamstrings in the first

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.440
four yards

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.599
like my whole back tightened up on me oh

00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:46.559
man i was

00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:48.720
i was so close to literally the best

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.079
thing that could have possibly happened

00:52:50.079 --> 00:52:51.520
which would have been you tearing

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.160
your hamstrings and these are falling

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.359
right there

00:52:55.359 --> 00:52:59.599
i was right there oh [ __ ]

00:52:59.599 --> 00:53:01.040
if that camera wasn't rolling i would

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.720
have stopped i would have just like

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.960
pulled up for a second

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.079
i couldn't i couldn't believe you guys

00:53:06.079 --> 00:53:09.200
did that i was what a great thing

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.720
that was funny we started we started we

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.599
were drinking and they started

00:53:11.599 --> 00:53:14.800
challenging each other to a race

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.839
well you were scared i was shocked at

00:53:17.839 --> 00:53:19.200
how that this could even be a

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.079
possibility

00:53:20.079 --> 00:53:22.640
this just fell into my lap yeah we

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.680
should do this because one of them had

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.079
to lose

00:53:26.839 --> 00:53:29.839
secrets

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.400
this special or the special olympics man

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:41.440
chain special olympics

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.160
he'd crush every event probably right

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.599
except for running right doesn't he

00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:47.839
not if we played any real sports oh of

00:53:47.839 --> 00:53:50.079
course if we did like a combine yeah but

00:53:50.079 --> 00:53:51.520
if we played like an actual like if

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.680
basketball was an event yeah maybe 101

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.040
basketball pass blocking like kick

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.200
thank you yeah all right we're gonna

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.400
we're gonna definitely i'm gonna sit out

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.319
i'm gonna sit out events

00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:04.720
did you do that i'm sitting out many of

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:07.440
that so i'm just trying to battle

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.000
the score so high is it is it like a

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:10.960
decathlon

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.119
or we just it would be a diff a bunch of

00:54:13.119 --> 00:54:14.400
different games

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.119
calisthenics and skill sets that'd be

00:54:17.119 --> 00:54:18.880
pretty tight my cousin dude haas tried

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.480
to do something like this before

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.079
he tried to have like a family-wide

00:54:22.079 --> 00:54:25.119
olympics and everyone's

00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:30.079
we should do we should do a chat nation

00:54:30.079 --> 00:54:32.000
uh we should just do a chat basketball

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:32.720
tournament

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.240
that'll be pretty tight everybody's

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:37.440
podcast versus each other's

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.359
yeah contact you can you can team up

00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:40.720
with the wood man you guys are the only

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:41.760
individuals

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.920
like a two on two white man can't jump

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.040
we would get

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.599
destroyed yo that's such a good idea we

00:54:47.599 --> 00:54:49.520
definitely i don't know

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.640

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.640
trying to set this up i said the kid in

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.559
ansley

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.520
[ __ ] out of it yeah that's true

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.880
that's dude that might that would be the

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.559
chance that would be the ship dude but

00:55:06.559 --> 00:55:08.079
then she would be she could beat the

00:55:08.079 --> 00:55:10.000
[ __ ] out of me well we're thinking about

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:10.319
oh

00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:11.920
yeah when we get when we get she does

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.079
two on two mma we do the jujitsu just

00:55:14.079 --> 00:55:14.880
call the foul

i mean i got a one strike white belt so

00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:20.400
you know and i'm probably going to wear

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.599
four ounce gloves i'm definitely going

00:55:21.599 --> 00:55:22.600
to throw something

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:26.480

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.520
slaps do you think rainy and black

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.760

from like a stressful event right now

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.720

week week one at the beach was really

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.440
fun but i was also

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.000
i was like but the behavior was so

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:32.720
unhealthy

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:35.040
it was crazy i was probably i smoked

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:35.920
like a thousand

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.200
cigarettes and was like

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.599
getting shit-faced and like sneaking

00:57:41.599 --> 00:57:43.920
mushrooms every night

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.640
alcohol mushrooms don't mix in my

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.400
opinion

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.359
yeah and then i've enjoyed it how much

00:58:17.359 --> 00:58:18.640
did you eat

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.160
and then again yeah you said you had a

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.839
decent amount yeah i've done it i don't

00:58:21.839 --> 00:58:22.960
like it

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.880
i just got well i stopped drinking

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.559
you're right i do stop drinking as soon

00:58:26.559 --> 00:58:27.599
as i take them

00:58:27.599 --> 00:58:29.760
yeah yeah or if it's a small amount i'll

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.440
keep drinking but yeah or just be

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.640
usually

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.160
usually it's a knockout because usually

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:36.000
it makes me slightly nauseous and if you

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
include alcohol with that that does suck

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.040
yeah that really sucks yep being drunk

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:42.240
and tripping is just strange

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.920
i remember i did it i was hammered and i

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.200
ate a bunch of them and i was drunk and

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.680
tripping and it was just like

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:50.400

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.119

01:00:54.799 --> 01:00:56.000
i know how you get in there that's i've

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.920
been trying to try to

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.440

quit cigarettes

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.520
i've been trying to like i've been

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.880
trying to like actually like sit down

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.559
and like write things

01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:16.960
during the day trying to organize some

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.240
thoughts i've been like reading

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.799
like watching stuff my sleep cycle is

01:01:20.799 --> 01:01:22.079
still like [ __ ]

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:24.880
i have like a hard time like getting

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.319
into like a rhythm

01:01:26.319 --> 01:01:28.720
but yeah i've had a i've had a genuinely

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.440
tough time

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:33.040
sleeping here yeah i'm like

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.640
usually getting that adrenaline that

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.880
nighttime stand up adrenaline boost

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.280
your body's wired to just be like being

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.880
a bit like you know eleven twelve one

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.280
eight

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.960
it's takes a while for your body to

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.000
readjust but and the time difference too

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.200
yeah the time difference out here really

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.040
[ __ ] me up for sure dude i uh

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.480
con you're talking about writing like

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.000
thoughts down i was reading so remember

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.200
i was talking about the book the shallow

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:55.680
shane

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.680
the book about the internet and how it's

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.799
affecting our brain

01:01:58.799 --> 01:02:01.119
the first half of that is just like the

01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:02.640
history of writing and reading it just

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.240
goes on for [ __ ] ever

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.520
they finally explain how the internet

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.200
affects our ability to learn and retain

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.599
information it's [ __ ] nuts

01:02:11.599 --> 01:02:14.799
it so when you read a book

01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:16.480
you just sit there like you're talking

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.839
about like forming ideas and writing

01:02:17.839 --> 01:02:19.119
stuff down if you're reading a book so

01:02:19.119 --> 01:02:20.720
if you're like

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.880
your short-term memory is like a like a

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.920
thimble you can only you know you can

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.680
only have like five chunks of it for

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.760
five to seven chunks of information

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.960
that's why phone numbers are like six

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.480
when like you know you can only they're

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.680
only like seven digits

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.119
yeah they chunk stuff together because

01:02:33.119 --> 01:02:34.720
if it's more than that your brain will

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.400
most likely just forget unless you sit

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.920
and wrote rehearsal it

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.079
so they're saying how typically if

01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:41.119
you're reading something

01:02:41.119 --> 01:02:43.039
or audio booking same thing really if

01:02:43.039 --> 01:02:44.799
you're doing that you're taking like

01:02:44.799 --> 01:02:46.880
your short-term memory is like a thimble

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.319
and that has to go it has to fill up

01:02:48.319 --> 01:02:49.520
your long-term memory which is like a

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.280
bathtub so you only bring a tiny bit of

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.559
information at a time and try to get it

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:54.079
to your long-term memory

01:02:54.079 --> 01:02:55.280
when you go so when you're reading it's

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.240
just like they're giving you little

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.760
drips and you're slowly it takes your

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.160
time

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.440
or you take your time you can do it when

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.520
you go online and they did studies of

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.400
this

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.760
so when you're on an internet when

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.240
you're like reading text with hyperlinks

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.400
your brain is constantly doing a little

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.839
problem solving like a crossword puzzle

01:03:09.839 --> 01:03:10.880
where like should i click that what

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.319
happens oh i click this thing

01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:13.839
and they've like you you end up not

01:03:13.839 --> 01:03:15.599
retaining any information because your

01:03:15.599 --> 01:03:17.119
short-term memory is just completely

01:03:17.119 --> 01:03:18.480
overloaded while you have this little

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.119
thimble

01:03:19.119 --> 01:03:20.640
and they're just gushing information at

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.839
you and you're the whole time it's like

01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:24.240
you're doing a crossword puzzle

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.520
so they're finding that and the way

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.599
people come up with ideas

01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:30.640
is that when you get enough information

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.160
into your long-term memory you form

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.359
what's called a schema

01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:34.799
so you can like read read read and then

01:03:34.799 --> 01:03:36.720
you're like oh this makes sense but if

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:36.960
you're

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.559
constantly reading online all you're

01:03:38.559 --> 01:03:40.880
doing is viscerally reacting to stimuli

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.240
and like you'll get a little bit you'll

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.599
get little bits here and there but it's

01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:44.640
not really

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.160
it doesn't really compare like hype it's

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.880
called hyper text the idea was that

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.240
so [ __ ] funny man the uh so like the

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.119
original

01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:55.520
sjw professors were saying like hyper

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.799
text was gonna free us from the

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:58.319
patriarchal authority of

01:03:58.319 --> 01:04:00.160
authors being like like you could write

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.440
a book chain and then like

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.880
i'm reading your book i'm trapped in

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.960
shane gillis's world dude you're exuding

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.200
patriarchal force over my thinking

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.720
but if i could go online i could read

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.839
like 30 different offers and

01:04:09.839 --> 01:04:11.440
continuously hyperlink between a bunch

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.640
of different ideas

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.760
and they're like this is there's gonna

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.960
be the wave of the future and they found

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.839
out they're like

01:04:15.839 --> 01:04:17.760
you don't really retain any information

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.960
at all

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.720
yeah dude i feel like that happens to me

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.160
all the time i will look at [ __ ] on the

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.839
internet all day and be like what did i

01:04:23.839 --> 01:04:24.799
even see

01:04:24.799 --> 01:04:26.960
you don't you your brain it's it's hard

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.319
for you to bring that stuff back because

01:04:28.319 --> 01:04:29.760
you're constantly you're using right

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.400
here

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.880
and you're constantly doing these little

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.319
pro you're problem solving the whole

01:04:34.319 --> 01:04:35.599
time and it's addictive too because

01:04:35.599 --> 01:04:37.119
our brains love little problem-solving

01:04:37.119 --> 01:04:38.720
activities so you're just sitting there

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.680
all day being like

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.839
click that oh what happens oh click that

01:04:41.839 --> 01:04:42.960
i'm going to read this and when people

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.400
read online they just read in an f

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.079
pattern they scan the first couple lines

01:04:46.079 --> 01:04:46.880
scan down

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.200
and then they skip the next thing it's

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.799
also like when it's in those little

01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:52.160
yeah when it's in those little bytes

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.760
it's like i'm just constantly reading

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.000
stuff

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.079
i don't trust so i'm just like well

01:04:56.079 --> 01:04:58.400
that's [ __ ] that's [ __ ]

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.799
that's yeah [ __ ] well it's weird if

01:05:00.799 --> 01:05:02.400
someone's written a big thoughtful thing

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.839
i'll be like all right

01:05:03.839 --> 01:05:05.920
it's weird to think that the new medium

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.960
now does not encourage forming

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.359
like ingrained schemas and ideas on the

01:05:11.359 --> 01:05:13.599
world

01:05:13.599 --> 01:05:15.200
you think that's yeah i guess it's by

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.359
design on some level but

01:05:17.359 --> 01:05:19.359
it feels like an accident right it's an

01:05:19.359 --> 01:05:21.039
accident yeah i think it's an accident

01:05:21.039 --> 01:05:22.240
i mean you would think you'd be

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.920
information overload i would think like

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.520
i go online to do research for stuff and

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.799
i'm just like

01:05:26.799 --> 01:05:30.319
what the [ __ ] what did i just read

01:05:30.319 --> 01:05:31.920
yeah yeah if you get until especially if

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.839
you get like into like

01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:35.440
two people debating something you don't

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.839
understand

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.039
it's also your so and then your

01:05:41.039 --> 01:05:42.400
long-term memory

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.680
that's constantly working in the

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.280
background so like if you have a problem

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.400
that you're like you can't think of a

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.599
solution for like if you're writing

01:05:47.599 --> 01:05:48.480
something you're like i don't know what

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.440
to do with this

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.960
you're supposed to just delete you you

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.720
concentrate like very specifically on

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.760
what you're doing and then you just go

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.640
do nothing

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.319
and then your long-term memory just

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:57.760
turns it around in the back of your head

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.200
and then that's how an idea will pop

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:02.079
into your brain like that

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.000
pretty neat pretty neat to start doing

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.280
that that is new stuff

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.640
neat it's just neat there's nothing

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.480
funny about it it's just neato

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.319
no it's neat yeah i think it's neat i

01:06:10.319 --> 01:06:11.440
think it's neat and i think you know i

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.960
think it's neat i appreciate that you

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.920
shared it

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.079
it'd be nice to be it'd be nice to be

01:06:16.079 --> 01:06:18.400
able to write

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.079
write things like write out a whole

01:06:20.079 --> 01:06:21.680
thing yep

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:24.960
and just have organized thoughts

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.960
well that they i haven't written up like

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.440
a paper

01:06:29.839 --> 01:06:33.839
kill yourself

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.680
when was the last time you wrote

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.000

01:06:38.079 --> 01:06:43.760
never yeah wouldn't that be nice

01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:46.960
i

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.400
yeah they think we're coming back do

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.559
they think our our

01:07:00.559 --> 01:07:02.160
little love you know face was it

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.480
aristotle or whatever well yeah

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.960
they both didn't plato write the cave or

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:07.839
something

01:07:07.839 --> 01:07:10.480
plato i think was the one who wrote down

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.160
socrates stuff so soccer

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:15.039

i'll tell you my secrets but dude you're

01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:19.599
getting you're writing [ __ ] down i'm

01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:23.039

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.720
what are you a coward you can't say it

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.720
in front you need to be hidden to write

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.319
it down you [ __ ]

01:07:28.319 --> 01:07:30.079
say it in front of people that's where

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:31.680
our uh i think that's where our whole

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.880
school system comes from of having to

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:33.920
memorize stuff

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.160
from the used to have to memor like it

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.680
was just all wrote memorization i think

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.400
it comes from

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.640
ancient greece that's why we've just

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.760
never changed right

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.680
just be like you have to know all of the

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.039
times tables it's like

01:07:45.039 --> 01:07:47.520
why dude well if you're if you're ever

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.880

01:19:32.719 --> 01:19:34.480
unfortunately in chinatown

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.600
uh that's the only place a lot of

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.960
footage because that's that's where our

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:39.040
enemies

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:42.560
not those not the asians not actually

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:45.520
our other enemies true we get a lot of

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.880
asian support by the way

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.560

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.480
if i put a billboard in

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.080
