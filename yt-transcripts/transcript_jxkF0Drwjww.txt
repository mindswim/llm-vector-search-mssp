00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.879
they all paid like a hundred bucks to

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.800

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.080
how are people still thinking

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.560
that's real because those are two words

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.080
those are two good words you want to

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.360
hear

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.200
juice and cleanse i'm like that has to

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.879
be good you could just drink motor oil

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.040
probably get away with it one day you

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.280
drink a cup of motor oil nothing else

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.720
you can also just cleanse yourself by

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.959
not eating for free yeah

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.319
like you don't have to put anything in

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.599
your body to cleanse just don't eat

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.480
drink water

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.720
perfect done free or you can spend a

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.599
hundred dollars on

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.480
cucumbers and [ __ ] cashews and then

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.120

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.040
have diarrhea i'm like sweet this worked

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.560
[ __ ] yeah yeah so you go

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.480
you go to cvs i was eyeing them up dude

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.680
i was thinking about getting just

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.360
a laxative and just dumping the rest of

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.959
the night

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.959
i don't need it but i saw him in there

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.640
and i was like that might be

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.720
it might be a good night's just [ __ ]

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.680
dump

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.680
yeah hell you'd be up on if you should

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.720
you just start abusing yourself

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.319
i mean that's actually yeah when you

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.840
start like when you start working out

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.599
again you take a layoff and you get back

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.159
into it

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.239
and then you're like but you're digested

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.599
you like start feeling good about going

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.400
to the gym

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.319
but you get so much like [ __ ] whey

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.840
and casein in you

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.440
that you don't [ __ ] for like a week and

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.200
a half and then you're like all right

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.210
vegetables

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.920
[Laughter]

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.080
just really just completely blow your

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.159
ass out you know

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.080
over the like oh you did two days of

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.200
eating like

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.760
an entire forest of broccoli and then

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.080
and finally the payoff comes

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.000
oh that's one of the most satisfying

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.439
shits you'll ever take

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.360
so good that is so the best now they're

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.720
too wide for your butthole

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.159
yeah it's probably like giving birth

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.000
it's probably like having your own child

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.080
it's the exact same thing oh man when

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.439

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.360
sexually

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.400
pleasing it's concerning at first it's

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.519
almost it's like a breach

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.280

also try to be cool

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.000
and get like i think target especially

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.759
and walmart and all of them have those

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.319
like

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.000
they all have like comic book shirts now

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.080
like vintage like star wars

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.240
yeah well that started to call they sell

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.000
this that started a couple years ago at

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.880
target

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.560
and it was so fun because like the first

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.000
iteration of those they were trying to

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.360
like synthesize

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.560
hipsterdom and then the internet and

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.400
everything at once so it's like a skin

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.440
tight washed out shirt with like cookie

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.400
monster

[Laughter]

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.440
it's just all of that i think i might

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.639
have had one of those

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.360

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.720
trying to remember what it was i know i

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.000

else other than jack daniels

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.680
yeah i'm trying to think it was always

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.319
like it was always like star wars or

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.759
[ __ ]

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:59.919
i had anyway when yeah when i was in

middle school i had uh

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.440
it was like one of those like [ __ ]

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.160
kmart like yin yang blue flame

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.400
there was like a like a skateboard with

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.319
like camouflage grip tape

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:15.440
in the middle were you a skater no i

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:15.840

i was fat you were bad you were posing

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.599
yeah yeah but well it's not posing i

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:23.680
mean that i was into the shirt

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.360
true yeah the every single comic was a

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.000
fat kid

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.280
was fat yeah same was fat yeah i was

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.959
asking because i was a fat skater

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:35.200
so i mean i did let's put it this way i

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.959
did skateboard i was no good at it i

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:37.680
could never

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.399
do more i could ollie i could i could

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:42.479
shove it i could 360 shove it

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:44.959
i landed maybe two kick flips ever and

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:45.839
then uh

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:48.160
and i could drop in and that was it dude

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.600
dropping in was it was the highest gear

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.640
dropped in from

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.200
not high at all just got to got it down

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.320
knew that i could do it

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.399
yeah i wouldn't ice my wrists

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:00.080
i think i dropped it on four feet and i

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.440
was like on a six footer and just

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.800
completely bitched out and just

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.200
never never tried again it's terrifying

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.959
dude these conversations are dangerous

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:08.000
because this is how you become

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
a guy who's like 38 it's like maybe i'll

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.480
try maybe i'll try

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.560
and remaster skateboarding and it's like

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.160
you got to just keep that [ __ ] with

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.360
video games you can't

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.920
you know dude please start if you put

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.600
the same effort you put into like your

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.000
car

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.200
and now lifting into skateboarding if

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.200
you like autistically attack becoming an

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.440
escape but you'd be landed like 900s

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.240
like a year my whole thing is about like

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.000
fixing my life the moment my

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.200
parents got divorced it's awesome going

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.640
back and correcting those

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.480
the things that would have gone right

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.440
had had things worked out

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.200
when did your parents get divorced uh

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.200
well i guess my mom left when i was nine

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.000
and then it took

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.880
like years before everything finalized

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.440
but

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.320
oh i thought you're saying it just

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.680
happened recently and that you started

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.640
hitting the gym real hard i'm like

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.440
that's what's up

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.000
no no no that's a nice move yeah in your

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.519
30s if your parents get a divorce to

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:04.160
just get it

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.920
house this weekend 100 extra push-ups

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.440
dude

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.279
parents got divorced as a 30 year old

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:10.959
and you're like expecting sympathy for

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:12.880
me

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.320
parents are dead yeah

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.200
they broke up i used to have a weird

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.240
like sinister

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.839
quiet fantasy when i was younger of my

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:23.519
parents getting divorced for some reason

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:24.720
my parents never got divorced and i

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.079
always fantasized about them getting

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:27.440
divorced and like damn that'd be so

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.399
[ __ ] sick

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:29.680
well it didn't make sense when they were

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.120
together i remember like because my

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.720
parents [ __ ] hated each other and

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.399
like moments of affection when i was

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:36.560
like very young were just like confusing

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.920
to me

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.760
it didn't make any sense like it just

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.040
like like i expected conflict from them

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.200
so when they got divorced it like made

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.560
sense you know and people would be like

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.279
i'm sorry

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:50.560
and be like what what what do you mean

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.440
i don't know i don't even know yeah yeah

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.640
that makes sense every once in a while

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.200
now

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.480
every once in a while now i'll still see

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.640
my parents like

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.920
every [ __ ] maybe once every 10 days

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.880
that i see them

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.480
there will be a moment of affection it's

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.560
like ew yeah it's disgusting

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.480
[ __ ] gross you guys hate it they hate

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.920
each other yeah really

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.160
hey cheese dicks they have they have

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.920
like a vapidity to them they're like

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.760
empty in the way canadians are they're

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.560
like

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.880
they're like they're like hymns if i had

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.360
to describe them they're like simulants

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.920
and so you can't really i can't hate

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.079
them anymore that i can hate siri you

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:25.760
know what i mean

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.600
i think i can never have a real affinity

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.120
for the property brushes because they're

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.920
inhuman

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.760
you know something about like a tucked

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.279
in dress shirt walking

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:35.200
and talking to another guy's wife just

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.720
bothers the [ __ ] out of me

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.079
right yeah one of them wears the

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:39.920
measuring tape and then the other one

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.920
is like i don't think he has he doesn't

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.959
do anything

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.360
he's a realtor he's a canadian realtor

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.079
yeah

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:47.120
he'll come in and be like i'm the

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.800
realtor he's the contractor and we're

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.079
are they canadian are they actually

00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:51.440
canadian because that would make sense

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.880
they have to be there's no way they can

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.360
be anything now you mention it

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.360
probably canadians are wild dude we did

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.200
a tour of canada last summer and it's

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.320
like they just

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.000
like they really are just sims i mean

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.760
it's this kind of like hodgepodge of

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.639
culture

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:06.480
where they have all of these cultural

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.040
inputs and then the sum of their parts

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.560
equal absolutely zero

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.040
it somehow like cancels everything out

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.639
it's like hologram america

[ __ ] like make them all catholic

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.279
and then send them down to kill all the

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:01.760
puritans so the puritans would just get

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.360
raided occasionally by

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.199
just canadian indians coming down just

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:06.399
cutting their heads off

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:07.839
they would literally come down and burn

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:09.760
people they would grab people and

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.360
set them on fire and then run back into

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.440
the woods the scariest things on earth

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.079
native americans rock yeah americans do

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:18.320
rock but they're also

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.120
they i mean it's good that the the the

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.279
settlers won that because

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.440
they'd be they were a problem that would

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.120
be tight if we lost and that's a scary

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:27.519
thing

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:28.800
that would be kind of cool if we lost

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.480
that whole war and whoever came to

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.000
america just became like

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.279
weird white native americans

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:37.519
yeah i think if they if they lose you

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:39.279
have to just go back to europe or you

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:40.800
die yeah you just go back in europe and

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.000
then

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.759
you know we'd come i mean it was it was

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:45.199
probably at the rate the

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:47.440
that europe was technologically

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.959
advancing it would have taken like three

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:50.240
more years for them to come back and

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.519
kill everybody

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:53.199
yeah if native americans had already

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:55.120
developed like firearms like imagine

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.680
native americans were exactly the same

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.279
you know wearing nothing but like a

00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:01.279
diaper and face paint

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:03.480
and living in a tp but then they had

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.199
ak-47s

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:07.600
that would be it'd be a problem dude

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.360
that would be child soldiers yeah the

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.279
only thing that they had invented

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:14.639
in [ __ ] 1490 was

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:15.780

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.120
it would take over they would have taken

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.480
they would have sailed to europe

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.160

these times 96 bronco with the eddie

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:14.799
bauer trim

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:16.720
that you converted into a technical with

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.120
a 50 cow on the roof

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.760
you still get lit up one of these nights

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.640

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.919
gonna hit you with a rock

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:27.520
and that's it's over dude they would

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.960
they would think you were like

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.280
uh a god if you came back there with a

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.360
50 cal on top of a bronco

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.400
and just did a 360 like and just took

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.039
out a village

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:38.960
people would just leave you of course

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.320
all you have to do is get to the castle

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.160
and you can just forever defend it

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.760
yeah you'd never be able to get out of

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.080
that bronco dude the second you stepped

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.520
out of that somebody's stabbing you

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.559
if we if we ever get the machines they

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:51.039
should let

00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:53.360
me know you should let the military

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.440
industrial complex go back in time to

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.280
just start wars with the past

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.360
that'd be awesome yeah that would be the

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.280
answer to everything it's just

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.520
sorry we have to spend 15 billion

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.039
dollars this year

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:08.960
to send blackwater to 1512 to

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.960
to to [ __ ] up the king of the franks

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.360
that would be awesome because yeah it's

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.640
because like there's different

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.320
it's not like a back to the future thing

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.160
where it would like [ __ ] up the current

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.799
history

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:22.960
you know what i mean because they would

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.480
technically be going into a different

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.440
dimension

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.360
and possibly [ __ ] up some other

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.960
dimensions future

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.480
and i guess you would have somebody

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.400
doing that to us but you would from your

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.840
position you would never be able to see

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.360
whether it was happening or not

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.679
but that would that would rock that's

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:38.720
actually

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.080
truthfully that's kind of what happened

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.400
to like the aztecs and the mines and

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:42.960
[ __ ] like

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.960
the spanish came over and it was like

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.559
they literally conquered those empires

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:48.160
with like a hundred dudes

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.160
yeah and the spanish thing they just

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.200
finished

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.600
the aztecs from the future if you think

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.520
about it

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.880
they're the same race i guess sort of

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.440
plus europeans what well you know now

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.240
yeah true yeah now is what i'm saying

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.150
now there's one word to cover them all

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.840
[Laughter]

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.880
there's one one slur that's the lord of

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.720
the rings

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.679
oh man there's a slur that only gandalf

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:22.400
knows and he whispered

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.919
with the frodo knows what the n word is

00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:27.039
none of those

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:28.799
none of the taller characters know what

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:30.080
the n word is and so they have to

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.160
protect frodo so he can go to mordor to

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.640
call

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:38.080
sauron explodes

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.000
dude i was talking to this uh i was

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.440
talking this irish kid the other day and

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.480
i it just

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.760
made me laugh think because you're not

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.520
allowed to say [ __ ] in ireland

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.960
that's like a bad word there what is

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.880
that i thought like gypsy right looks

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.480
like they're [ __ ] that gypsies i

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.160
think is acceptable but like

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.840
[ __ ] is and then it was funny he was

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.200
like they're not white

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.919

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:03.520

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.240
well that's from the trash yeah our

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.919
perspective they're the whitest people

00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:08.240
there

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.880
are yeah and it's funny in in ireland

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.840
they're like no

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.600
they can't be white just because they're

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.360
in travelers but uh

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.880
guess what i was thinking i wonder i

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.480
wonder if there's a country where you

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.000
are allowed to say the n-word

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.200
and i was thinking how funny that would

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.120
be to hear that um

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.000
definitely not niger you probably can't

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.360
get away with it there

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.799
if there's just one country where just

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:30.640
for some reason it's socially acceptable

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.320
what's the deal with niger does neither

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.559
suck is it like yeah

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:36.159
because it's because nigeria is like

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:38.559
popping off nigeria nigeria is rocking

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:40.080
it's really kind of stuck to be niger

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.840
because i imagine that was the first one

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.400
and then ariel was like let's

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.840
let's tone it down a bit

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:52.960
i don't know we can go full niger hard

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.000
art but

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.400
we'll go to nigeria and then they've got

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.679
like one of the fastest growing

00:20:57.679 --> 00:20:59.120
economies and so true

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.559
nigeria i remember uh it was in

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:04.880
i was in cdc and we had a priest come

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.840
from niger

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.840
the original name of nigeria was house

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.240
niger

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:12.400
he pointed he told us where he was from

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.320
and he spelled it i remember in like

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.400
third grade being like what the [ __ ] is

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.360
going on here

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.159
dude this guy just wrote the word the

00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:23.360

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.440
[Laughter]

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.039
but a teacher has to explain to you be

00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:38.400
like no you're thinking the one with

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.450

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.640
third i think third in four seasons it

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.080
started getting like really political

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.440
and started getting like super woke and

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.519
all this stuff but the funny part is

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:16.880
it's about an all-white family in the

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.480
south side of chicago which just doesn't

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:18.960

at all like anywhere down there so they

00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:24.000
have this like weird preachy show about

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.760
a white family

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.919
and like everyone in there when you

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:29.679
watch it enough it's just

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:31.039
it's always just about poor people and

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:32.640
they're always like [ __ ] in bathroom

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.399
stalls and just like doing like horrible

00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:36.080

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.279
it's like just weird it's weird like

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:40.720

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:44.480
nice time with your fam like

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.640

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.399
gay guys [ __ ] in like a coal stall

00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:49.600

first right it was a british show yeah

00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:57.919

oh they're supposed to be it's just the

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.200
way they set it up is really funny

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.240
because it's like it's supposed to be

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.240
like this racially conscious show

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.519
and the whole premise of it that makes

00:32:05.519 --> 00:32:08.320
zero [ __ ] sense yeah

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.159

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.279
everyone in there is like i

00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:51.039
it's just for chinese women

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.320
[Music]

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.720
you're not wrong you're not wrong when

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.840
you say that

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.080
but something to consider she's still

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:00.880
arguing

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.360
no idea crazy it's crazy how good of a

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.200
show that would be it's crazy how good

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.559
that would be there's four

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:08.320
chinese women screaming and then we'll

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.240
be reacting to it

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.320
but like the way she normally does which

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.720
is in one ear out the other and then

i've been called a [ __ ] my entire life

00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:40.240

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.880
it never abated and i'm not [ __ ] what

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.839
i'm not allowed

it's not like the [ __ ] n word if i if

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.680
i might feel the same way about the

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.640
n-word

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.040

00:36:58.079 --> 00:37:00.560
yeah that's kind of that is you could be

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.760
you could be the turning point i mean

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.720
the word uh

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.839

in there sorry man no it's all good i

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.760
was talking to a guy recently he was a

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.200
psychologist and he was saying how he

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.240
trained

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.040
like a deeply deeply autistic guy uh to

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.720
have like theory of mind so like that's

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.000
when you're autistic you can't

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.920
think about other people thinking things

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.320
at all like you just you have no concept

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.839
and they he used this like you know

00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:39.280
whatever theory he had and they did it

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.400
they did these drills

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.560
and they gave this deeply autistic man

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.680
theory of mind

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.280
and after a week he started getting in

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.880
fist fights because he finally

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.560
understood [ __ ]

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.040
he was like oh you're making fun of me

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.160
and he started fighting but he was

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.280

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.640
is learning that the world is just

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.160

00:40:45.599 --> 00:40:46.160
abe

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.720
how did they figure that out well james

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.160
buchanan never married a woman which

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.599
back then was just like

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:55.839
as as gay as you could be yeah true

00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:57.200
sure i wonder did they like find their

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.800
diaries do they have like secret gay

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.640
diaries is that how you got abraham yeah

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.440
yeah

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.440
well abe's not actually gay i don't

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.480
think i'm i

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.000
i won't let that happen but what

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.680
happened didn't he sleep with a guy in a

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.560
bed or something yeah

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.640
but that the argument is that was like

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.280
acceptable back then

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.720
what did he write though why did he why

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.160
did he write that in his name they would

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.760
write some they would write some nice

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.200
love letters back and forth

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.880
if that was like standard protocol why

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.800
would he even mention it

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.680
no he they would just like he'd be

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.880
staying at the guy's house

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.079
or like they'd be staying together and

00:41:28.079 --> 00:41:30.240
there'd be one bed true okay so like we

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.599
just know but they would write each

00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:32.160
other

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.200
him and his best friend i forget the

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.720
guy's name would write like you're also

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.160
actually like love letters

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:40.800
fully clothed back then too yeah

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.079
you wear a suit to bed that was about

00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:46.319
1800 so it's not like any kind of funny

00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:47.359
business could happen

00:41:47.359 --> 00:41:50.480
you know true but you think about like

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.280
the all the gay [ __ ] abraham lincoln did

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.080
like [ __ ]

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.000
[Laughter]

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.480
giving speeches and going to play i mean

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.920
it's like

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.640
i don't know yeah but how how gay would

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.400
you be and how gay would your letters be

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:04.960
if you just

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.800
had no concept that anyone else would

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.920
ever read them or there would be

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.800
technology they spread

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.000
or that being gay was or that being gay

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.240
was

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.920
even a possibility like back then they

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.760
were probably like you can be as get

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.160
like there are no gay dudes and no one's

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.079
if somebody accuses you of being gay

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:23.190
that is a gun fight

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.280
[Laughter]

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.359
you can be as gay as you want there's no

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:29.119
there's no sex in culture they're all

00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:30.640
repressed so like even like

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.640
getting [ __ ] and you're straight you're

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.920
probably like putting your dick in

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.119
you're like what the [ __ ]

00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:40.720
this is crazy it's

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.800
such a [ __ ] i mean it feels good but

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.319
i mean this is like it's

00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:46.480
weird that we do this we shouldn't be

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.680
reading

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.640
you know oh man looking at i'm sorry uh

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.079
if we're talking history i'm still

00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:54.480
harping on this [ __ ] book i'm in but

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.960
funny part uh in like 1730

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.359
there was just a diphtheria outbreak in

00:43:01.359 --> 00:43:02.000
new england

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.720
and one one small village lost 280

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.160
children

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:09.760
in one year dude

00:43:09.839 --> 00:43:11.839
they died they would die in like 10

00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:13.280
hours yeah

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.960
they would get it their throats would

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.800
swell up and just die right away and

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.640
they were like [ __ ] witches

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.280
are out here a [ __ ] obnoxious

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.839
gofundme would have been in like the

00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:26.960
[ __ ]

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.359
just uh yeah the gofundme were all the

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:30.000
s's or

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.040
f's there's no spaces in sentences

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.480
what's different uh it's

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.319
what i've understood from it is just

00:43:40.319 --> 00:43:41.839
your throat swells up and gets like

00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:45.599
patches of like ashy like sores on it

00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:47.119
and you know you [ __ ] die you can't

00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:49.440
breathe and uh

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.119
[ __ ] and the whole town skids that

00:43:53.119 --> 00:43:54.560
and then i think the way they responded

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.119
to it was they burnt like three ladies

00:43:57.119 --> 00:43:59.280
okay would they blame it which is good

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.240
dude

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.359
so there you go if you're like the

00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:03.280
weirdest that makes sense why kind of

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.720
like there's that social pressure around

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.160
being like too weird or eccentric

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.359
because back then like if

00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:08.800
the kids died from a disease they would

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.319
find the three weirdest people and burn

00:44:10.319 --> 00:44:10.880
them

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.240
yeah it had been one of these

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.480
[ __ ]

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.640
when contempt for the women try to claim

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.000
the oppression of like

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.079
witches during the same yeah like 30 of

00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:21.440
them died

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.680
it's like and the whole town's kids died

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.040
dude like

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.040
[Music]

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.720
yeah the witches actually compared to

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.839
just about everybody back then had it

00:44:31.839 --> 00:44:34.800
decent yeah i mean most people back then

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.280
died

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.359
on fire that's how it ended

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:40.960
so though is that a real claim is that a

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.160
real claim depression be like they used

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.359
to burn us as witches

00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:46.160
oh yes there was it was like a phase

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.760
where women were thinking witches were

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.160
cool

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.480
like this year like within the last

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.440
calendar year

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.119
witches were really cool and women were

00:44:53.119 --> 00:44:54.800
calling themselves witches

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.920
yeah yeah they are so

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.920
goddamn stupid we might have to burn we

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.680
have to burn one more witch dude just to

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.560
send a message

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.960
true who hillary we should if you ever

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.079
claim one

00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:08.560
that's part of your oppression then we

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.119
should

00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:11.040
send a couple of women that openly

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.400
identify as witches

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.280
too whatever that island is where the

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:15.839
[ __ ]

00:45:15.839 --> 00:45:19.599
natives ate that christian missionary

00:45:19.599 --> 00:45:21.599
and just send those send the witch women

00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:24.400
there to maybe do witchcraft on the sri

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.560
lankan isolated island

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:30.839
and let them be eaten and burned by

00:45:30.839 --> 00:45:32.079
natives

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:33.680
just because it's like there has to be

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.520
some of the oppression still going on

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:36.480
the [ __ ] about it

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.800
you know i mean it's like it's i'm okay

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.000
raising

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.440
the the the long shadow of slave or

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.599
chattel slavery in the united states

00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:47.440
when you consider that [ __ ] like

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.960
black people are still being murdered by

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.400
the police every day

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.200
but if you're some 400 pound woman who

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.880
ran out

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.480
ran out of things to talk about and

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.720
you're like well now i'm focus pocus

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.560
and that means you need to shut up when

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.359
i'm talking because 500 years ago

00:46:03.359 --> 00:46:05.760
they set people like me on fire and

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.800
we'll take one of them

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.960
and feed them to a tribe of natives

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.280
we need to be or you could just take it

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.960
you could you could still you could

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:15.520
still

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.359
get executed i'm sure publicly in like

00:46:17.359 --> 00:46:19.119
saudi arabia or iran for something like

00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:20.000
that

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.839
maybe not iran but like you're going to

00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:23.599
saudi arabia and you're a lady claiming

00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:26.480
witch [ __ ] dude they might a couple boys

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.680
might be scared of you too

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.119
but it has to be specifically for

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.880
witchcraft you just put like a

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.880
a woman in saudi arabia they'll execute

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.640
her for like parallel parking

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.280
so yeah they'll kill a woman for

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.400
claiming anything over there if you're a

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.880
woman you're like i'mma there's like

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.760
what right yeah for on i know you're on

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.280
a i know you're on a dude's rock kick

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.480
how do you feel about uh

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.680
saudi arabian laws uh it feels like

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.720
dudes rock

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.040
over in saudi arabia quite a bit he's in

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.440
[ __ ] what's his mbs kind of like

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.079
opening things up a bit and making it

00:46:58.079 --> 00:47:00.000
because he pushed he pushed for the uh

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.680
for women being alive yeah well that's

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.359
because they just wanted like the wwf

00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:04.800
there so they had to pretend to be nice

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.680
to women

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.760
yeah true it's like the olympics when

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.520
they hide the holocaust

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.000
yeah it's like not exactly like that we

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.440
got wrestlemania but come on

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.599
we're good sorry the middle east is

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:16.720
doing that with wrestling

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.839
they're like dude if we get sean

00:47:17.839 --> 00:47:19.599
michaels here all we have to do is stop

00:47:19.599 --> 00:47:22.000
we just can't beat up a woman this week

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.160
we get hbk this is a good move

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.240
is wrestling still wrestling people are

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.520
still into wrestling

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.440
i mean yeah people that should be into

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.040
wrestling but are people

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.480
like you people who shouldn't be into

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.160
wrestling still into wrestling

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.400
like the farm show and uh my nickname

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.079
was farm show for about a year

show

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.200
farm show yeah because people just

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.040

i don't know why i wouldn't naturally

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.640
assume that it has to do with uh

you know farting in somebody's car but i

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.280

that i a couple years ago that i thought

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.760
would be awesome

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.280
because that would be when they started

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.440
like really like [ __ ] playing the

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.119
hits with like 90s true crime because

00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:49.280

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:01.680
know the first

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.920
yeah the first episode is like maybe two

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.839
days prior to the murders

00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:07.599
and pretty rough at the end like putting

00:53:07.599 --> 00:53:09.440

maybe two you know two days before the

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.319

his development of cte or whatever and

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:21.520
then

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:24.079
you keep like stepping back into you

00:53:24.079 --> 00:53:25.520
know leading up to it and then it

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.960
eventually like culminates with the

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.520
murders maybe about halfway through

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:33.040
and then uh and then the the second half

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.640
is about the other guys in the band

[Laughter]

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.279
top i have strongly considered

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:48.239
buying a gaming computer so i can get

01:09:48.239 --> 01:09:49.839
out of this napoleonic hell

01:09:49.839 --> 01:09:52.480
you do it dude i'm stuck in napoleon i

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.000
was thinking about that today i was like

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.600
oh yeah well his headphones broke

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.520
because if his laptop does i'm like why

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:58.719
don't you just buy it i'll leave you a

01:09:58.719 --> 01:10:00.400
laptop for like 900 bucks

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.640
there's no audio on this computer either

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.880
it's just my ex's computer

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.360
dude get a laptop and play shogun dude

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.960
when the screen saver comes on it's just

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:09.600
her name

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.520
i'm gonna pistol that's her name on the

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.960
board go ahead

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.480
so when you had so when you were playing

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.560
the so when you play the napoleonic wars

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.159
you need to have your headphones in so

01:10:18.159 --> 01:10:19.440
you can hear the sound

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.880
no i don't i don't listen to sound you

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.880
go silent strategy game

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.239
yes what maybe listen to it like an i uh

01:10:26.239 --> 01:10:29.360
podcast or uh yeah that makes sense are

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.239
you saying you're doing that yeah yeah

01:10:30.239 --> 01:10:31.360
yeah yeah

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.360
it's crazy i need to hear the sound like

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.719
if i'm moving troops i gotta hear like

01:10:34.719 --> 01:10:36.000
wow

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.080
yeah it's uh look i'm not proud of it

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.400
actually yeah that game [ __ ] rules i

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.159
know but it is funny to think that like

01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:44.480
your

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.560
your external your gpu is the thing

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.000
that's keeping you from playing any

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.520
other better game like only the french

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:49.920
one

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:53.600
works yeah and what's crazy is somehow i

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.120
don't know what version of mac i have or

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.880
like how it plays on stream

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.000
but no other games work like i'll try to

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.679
play the old one the old one was better

01:11:01.679 --> 01:11:02.000
the

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.800
the colonial one yeah that one was fun

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.159
it was like french and indian war you

01:11:06.159 --> 01:11:08.880
rogers rangers are in the [ __ ] game

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.400
in the game dude that's a unit you get

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.159
can you be the natives

01:11:12.159 --> 01:11:13.760
yeah there's a version where you can you

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.040
can be the natives and take over the

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.480
[ __ ] continent dude that'd be fun as

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.360
[ __ ]

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.679
yeah that's that's actually a good one

01:11:19.679 --> 01:11:21.199
maybe

01:11:21.199 --> 01:11:22.960
i should recommend that you can play as

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.880
the natives and take over america

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.120
in colonial america that is sick which

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.159
one

01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:31.760
that's empires it should be like a

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:32.960
british guy on the

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.159
the art british soldier

01:11:36.159 --> 01:11:37.760
they make it realistic they make it

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.360
realistic as the native americans that

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.480
it's like super

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.239
super super hard to like defeat the

01:11:42.239 --> 01:11:43.840
villagers yeah

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.440
if you are the native americans you

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.960
gotta have like ten to one

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.560
troops to kill them that's pretty good

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.159
early on yeah if you start uniting

01:11:54.159 --> 01:11:54.880
tribes you can

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.080
if they would have united they could

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.920
have [ __ ] us up quite a bit i don't

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.480
know why i say

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.640
us but they would have you know they got

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.400
the pale faces pretty good

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.679
yeah that's true if they weren't well

01:12:03.679 --> 01:12:04.880
yeah that well that's the same thing

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:05.679
with the mines

01:12:05.679 --> 01:12:07.040
the guy rolled in just pitted them all

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.880
against each other it was just yeah

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.080

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.600

01:12:22.159 --> 01:12:24.400
like oh [ __ ] [ __ ] he was like yeah go

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.920
get some gold

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.679
he got it i think he killed him anyway

01:12:27.679 --> 01:12:29.040
he's a yeah

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.960
quite the change quite the chessman he

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.400
just moved right next to the king was

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.280
like checkmate

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.840
whole civilization dead

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.640
yeah there's a good book about uh from

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.719
it's written by diego de landa

01:12:42.719 --> 01:12:44.880
it was a spanish i think i think it was

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.320
a spanish missionary who went down there

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.520
and just recorded

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.040
all of the [ __ ] about the mayans before

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.480
they got extinct it was like here's a

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.120
deal with him

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.199
he hated him he was like these guys suck

01:12:53.199 --> 01:12:54.880
he got executed i think eventually in

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.080
spain

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.719
the mines had to be extinct before any

01:12:58.719 --> 01:12:59.760
spa any

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.280
was it who went down there first it was

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.199
a spanish or portuguese

01:13:03.199 --> 01:13:05.199
i think the mayans i don't think

01:13:05.199 --> 01:13:06.719
europeans killed the mayans

01:13:06.719 --> 01:13:09.679
no no death dude it was uh right sure i

01:13:09.679 --> 01:13:11.199
think it was the incans and the aztecs

01:13:11.199 --> 01:13:12.719
that got rocked

01:13:12.719 --> 01:13:15.360
no the mayans bro it was the all right

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.040
diego de landa was the one who went down

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.400
there and was just like

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.920
he would tour they would search their

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.520
things for like relics of

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.960
witchcraft or whatever it was they'd

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.480
call whatever their like they would call

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.840
their barbaric religion

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.280
and if you found that they would just

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.280
beat the [ __ ] out of you

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.480
then he started i think he started like

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.600
burning people and [ __ ] and then the

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.040
crown found out i was like dude what the

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:33.360
[ __ ]

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.640
he was like i'm sorry yeah we're gonna

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.320
kill you now the king just he went down

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.360
there for the king and then killed a

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.480
bunch of people and the king was like

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.000
idiot would you do that for i didn't

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.400
know i wasn't allowed to do that

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.960
he's like i'm

01:13:47.679 --> 01:13:50.719
the french would send missionaries like

01:13:50.719 --> 01:13:53.040
these jesuits and [ __ ] would go into the

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.000
the wilderness

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.520
like they were like language experts to

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.520
try to spread catholicism

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.000
but they like trained to get murdered

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.440
these dudes like went over there knowing

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.120
full well they were gonna get like

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.320
flayed what was that movie

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.159
silence is that the movie about it yeah

01:14:08.159 --> 01:14:10.000
that movie's great i should i tried

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
watching it but it was back before i

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.560
was making money so it was a rip and the

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.080
sound was [ __ ] up

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.760
no it's really good i should go back and

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:18.960
watch it again the same thing happened

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.880
when i tried to watch either siriana or

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.560
michael clayton i can't remember which

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.440
and i

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.560
because of which i've never seen one of

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.120
the two

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.640
i can't remember which one it was yeah i

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.400
think they're the same they're the same

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.199
movie

01:14:31.199 --> 01:14:32.320
i think there was a bunch of those

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.719
wasn't there one with leonardo dicaprio

01:14:34.719 --> 01:14:37.040
where he plays what like that's siriana

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.600
there's one with him and russell crowe

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.080
yeah i don't remember were they playing

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.440
after 9 11 there was

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.960
after 9 11 there was a bunch of like

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.679
terrorist thrillers that were like

01:14:47.679 --> 01:14:51.199
somehow not maybe like they never like

01:14:51.199 --> 01:14:52.640
killed any terrorists

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.159
yeah there's always always the always

01:14:54.159 --> 01:14:56.239
plot was always like we're the ones in

01:14:56.239 --> 01:14:57.679
on it

01:14:57.679 --> 01:15:00.159
really like america is behind it not not

01:15:00.159 --> 01:15:02.080
911 but like america's

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.600
we're controlling the strings here you

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.560
can't you you can't kill that guy

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.480
you know wait when was it this is yours

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:10.400
that make any sense after no after 9 11

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.239
after saying after 9 11 there was like

01:15:12.239 --> 01:15:13.520
movies about terrorists where

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.440
at the end it would be like america was

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:16.800
like i think it was it was probably

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.560
towards the end not the end of the iraq

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.560
war but like once we realized iraq was a

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.280
mistake

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.560
they started making these movies that

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.679
were like yeah like you you'd be

01:15:25.679 --> 01:15:27.280
you know there'd be a field agent that

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.199
was like gung-ho and then

01:15:29.199 --> 01:15:30.880
cia i think i'm just describing the

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.080
movie with russell crowe and leonardo

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.000
dicaprio

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.600
no that's that's a classic trope in like

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.199
the buddy cop movie like they solved the

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:38.960
mystery but the police chief was crooked

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.840
the whole time yeah

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:42.400
oh [ __ ] turn around we figured out the

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:42.960
mole

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:45.520
well that's like in an otherwise almost

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.360
perfect movie the biggest flaw in

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.040
minority report

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.800
is uh is when [ __ ] max von

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.159
sinned out what's that what's that guy's

01:15:54.159 --> 01:15:56.000
name maxwell it's in dallas

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.120
because uh uh just uh how did you say

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.560
she drowned again

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.480
and then tom cruise go i never said she

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.560
drowned and they throw in that like

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.960
cheese dick [ __ ] like trope at the

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.480
end of the movie

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.760
yeah that cliched you know i never said

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.400
she was

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.400
you know blah blah blah blah but

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.080
otherwise mine already report [ __ ]

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.120
rocks

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.640
i gotta watch i haven't i don't think

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.320
i've seen it i think i don't think i've

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.120
ever seen it

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.800
i think i tried to watch it recently and

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.560
it kind of sucks now i know it could be

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:24.960
wrong

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.880
minority report is the most prescient

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.760
movie ever made

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.800
it's prescient mean it means like like

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.760
so that movie came out in 2002

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.320
and if you watch it now and it was if it

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.000
was made today

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.199
and it was supposed to be a movie

01:16:41.199 --> 01:16:42.800
portraying the future it would still

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.080
seem like 100

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.800
accurate like we're totally on track too

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.199
yeah

01:16:47.199 --> 01:16:49.280
gonna be the world everything else they

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.960
they got the numbers wrong they missed

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:52.000
the mark

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.280
you know there's all these yeah i

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.280
watched uh i was i tried to watch blade

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.719
runner again and i think that was set

01:16:56.719 --> 01:16:57.120
like

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.960
a year ago yeah it's set in like 20

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.280
seconds like flying cars and [ __ ]

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.199
blade runner is a [ __ ] masterpiece

01:17:03.199 --> 01:17:04.800
you know i mean it's like

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:08.640
but just the metric of like how

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.480
accurate a movie is at portraying the

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.920
future i don't think anything

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:15.199
[ __ ] tops minority report it's it's

01:17:15.199 --> 01:17:17.840
truly it's truly crazy to watch how it's

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.679
like nothing i mean it literally looks

01:17:19.679 --> 01:17:21.199
like it could have come out like

01:17:21.199 --> 01:17:24.000
this year when you watch it now and

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:24.960
they're still

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.719
they're still talking about 2050. the

01:17:26.719 --> 01:17:28.320
problem you're getting me fired up dude

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.080
dude the politics are all still relevant

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.440
too i mean it's like the whole thing's

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.120
about like what if we had

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.960
a way to predict crime before it

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.040
happened and

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.640
like i mean yeah there's like there's so

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.239
many details of the movie that are

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:43.679
even the extent that like uh you know

01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:44.560
like

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.360
like how dc has become like rapidly

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.120
gentrified which was already starting to

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.320
happen at like in

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.800
2002 anyways i mean it happened in like

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.320
the mid 90s but like

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.360
that he just like lives in dc you know

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.600
when i guess not really 2002 you'd have

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.600
to go further back but i mean that's a

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.480
minor point

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:05.040
the like the way things look like the

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.320
products and [ __ ]

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.159
you know like like uh being able to

01:18:08.159 --> 01:18:10.000
control things with your hands on like a

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:10.880
screen

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.120
yeah matt you used to do that on stage

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.320
oh yeah

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.400
like shows would be like hold on my next

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.520
joke is coming

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.199
i pretend that like those future movies

01:18:19.199 --> 01:18:21.600
where they're like

01:18:21.679 --> 01:18:24.320
people people would honestly be upset

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.480
that's all minority people

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:27.600
people in the crowd would be like what

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.199
the [ __ ] am i looking at that'll be like

01:18:29.199 --> 01:18:30.320
next joke

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:40.560
yeah that's all like my inaudible

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.400
i don't know i wonder when movies you

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.159
play total war i'll watch

01:18:44.159 --> 01:18:46.320
mine yeah i wonder if movies could be

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.920
predict the future like damn that got it

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:48.719
right it was just

01:18:48.719 --> 01:18:50.880
it was never an idea that some evil guy

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.320
watched it was like perfect

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.640
i'll just do that thing from the movie

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.440
yeah like [ __ ]

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.280
that's a good idea yeah like making a

01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:58.450
death star

01:18:58.450 --> 01:19:01.360
[Laughter]

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.120
i'd be sick if we had that yeah true

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.480
we we should have that we should be

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.320
working on that dude imagine that if you

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.760
wanted to [ __ ] with another country if

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.600
it the united states military did make a

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.840
death star and flew like if they like

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.760
you know mockingbird media like

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.360
afghanistan whoever they wanted to fight

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.400
i guess now i think they're fighting

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:19.520
africa they're trying to go

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.080
take their uh what you call it like

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.600
natural resources

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.120
hit them with like the brand new star

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:26.880
wars and then just act it out over them

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.080
where they're like oh

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:34.080
[ __ ] just have those little tiny planes

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.760
it could just be just regular harmless

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.760
lasers just fly

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.520
you should start psyop in the world like

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.520
hard with just made up [ __ ] like that

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.360
yeah it'd be awesome harder than we do

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.440
we should yeah we should build like yeah

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:46.960
like a giant you could build something

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.280
that just floated above

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.760
afghanistan that was big enough like id4

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:52.480
on afghanistan

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.840
you just scare them and be like yo the

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.360
death star is above you guys you better

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.159
not [ __ ] up

01:19:56.159 --> 01:19:59.600
i remember reading a popular like

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.520
like 20 years ago where they're talking

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.120
about like the future battlefield or

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.520
whatever rail guns were a big thing but

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.280
they also had um

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.280
uh god i think that i don't know if like

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.040
the navy finally developed a

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.639
functional rail gun and they're like

01:20:12.639 --> 01:20:14.239
yeah it's not worth it they spent like

01:20:14.239 --> 01:20:16.159
billions of dollars making this rail gun

01:20:16.159 --> 01:20:17.040
yeah

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.840
and like sound they loved sound they

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.120
they thought they could kill people with

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:21.760
like

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.239
yeah humvees with like speakers on them

01:20:24.239 --> 01:20:25.120
sonic boom

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.719
they also had it but they just like it

01:20:26.719 --> 01:20:28.800
was basically an open microwave the

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.000
directed microwave

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.760
like tinfoil in the microwave and turned

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.320
it on and like cooked people from 300

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.560
like yards away and they're like uh it's

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.360
100

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:39.620
safe

01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:42.639
[Laughter]

01:20:42.639 --> 01:20:45.280
yeah it takes like 10 minutes yeah they

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.600
have to like stand there and be like ah

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.639
yeah that's funny it's popcorn hit

01:20:50.639 --> 01:20:52.480
popcorn

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.760
but one of the things one of the things

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.199
i remember they had which is like some

01:20:55.199 --> 01:20:57.120
of the ideas that the military has

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.440
uh or have are so juvenile and like i

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.639
mean i guess it would work but it was

01:21:00.639 --> 01:21:01.520
like a [ __ ]

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.360
it's basically a satellite that's a

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.639
[ __ ] revolver

01:21:04.639 --> 01:21:07.440
with like big tungsten rods in it and it

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:10.239
can just drop the tungsten rods

01:21:10.239 --> 01:21:12.480
you know like onto the earth but the

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.960
kinetic force of a tungsten rod dropping

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.239
from space

01:21:16.239 --> 01:21:18.159
and hitting the earth is like it [ __ ]

01:21:18.159 --> 01:21:19.360
blows the [ __ ] up

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:24.000
it's like a meteorite just extinct

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.400
yeah but like tungsten's like like a

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.320
valuable it's like rare you need it for

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.440
light bulbs and [ __ ]

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.600
i guess you have to because it's space

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.800
force is going to be

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.560
space wars to go did you see them unveil

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:37.920
the space force flag

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:40.639
no trump oh it's [ __ ] great the flag

01:21:40.639 --> 01:21:42.000
like the

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.280
trump was standing behind the guy that

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.280
was like holding it like at an angle

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.639
and the other guy tried to extend the

01:21:46.639 --> 01:21:48.960
flag so the the pole like

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.880
came off the pivot and just hit trump's

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.400
foot

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:55.360
trump walked away it's everything that

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.560
god does

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.960
he's [ __ ] funny it's so funny we got

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.000
a face wars

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.600
yeah we have like the the almost like

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.239
the star trek logo really space wars

01:22:04.239 --> 01:22:06.320
they should just they should steal the

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.320
star trek logo and then when star trek

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.320
complains just be like shut up shut up

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.159
yeah

01:22:12.159 --> 01:22:14.400

levels of of

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.480
of society and then also a system that's

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.960
designed to just funnel money towards

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.280
people that already had money and

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.199
it's just continuing to operate the way

it always has

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.400

01:29:19.199 --> 01:29:23.280
yeah the the the left is is really

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:26.960
how are they this [ __ ] gay true

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.800
like how that's the one thing minority

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.320
port failed to predict

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:33.199
yeah yeah the left would just be smug

01:29:33.199 --> 01:29:33.840
[ __ ]

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:36.080
well yes they're it no that's their mo

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.920
it is literally minority report i mean

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.440
it's like [ __ ] it's a bunch of

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.040
liberals saying like that are

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.440
in favor of like prior [ __ ] restraint

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.159
basically

01:29:46.159 --> 01:29:48.320
which is yeah you know this idea that

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.920
you know everybody needs to stay home

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.600
in case something bad happens we need to

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.280
give up all of our civil liberties in

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.560
case something bad happens

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.040
where people like protesting in the name

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:57.600
of freedom

01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.840
as misguided and [ __ ] childish as it

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:00.800
may be

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:04.080
is like just like they now associate

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.840
the ideas of freedom and liberty

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.480
themselves with being like something

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.960
to immediately mock or have disdain for

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.560
just because they associate it with like

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.679
oh the trumpets

01:30:13.679 --> 01:30:16.000
it's like of course all of my data

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.520
should be in the hands of

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:20.560
uh big corporations and and the [ __ ]

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:22.400
government of course i should be demand

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.320
like forced to stay home and forcibly

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.000
vaccined it's like i'm

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.320
i'm saving lives there's no push back to

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.760
like any of this from any of these

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.400
people and

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:33.040
like the the idea that you would want to

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.000
push back or

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.840
or say like you know hey i have a

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.840
problem with this at all or question any

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:38.400
of

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.560
you know like the data or like you know

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.159
even bring up that like

01:30:42.159 --> 01:30:44.159
you know the antibody test or whatever

01:30:44.159 --> 01:30:45.440
anything you do is now

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.679
seen as like it's just it's just met

01:30:47.679 --> 01:30:48.960
with like

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:50.560
yeah that's that's kind of like smug

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:52.320
liberal mockery that's not based in

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.520
anything other than just

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:56.480
like like pretentiousness i mean it's

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:57.600
it's not yeah

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:58.960
it's that i've been telling that dude

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:00.719
i've been i've been watching cnn at

01:31:00.719 --> 01:31:01.600
night sometimes

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:03.920
there was a guys there was a guy yeah

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:05.679
there was a guys prior to this that it

01:31:05.679 --> 01:31:07.120
had something to do with [ __ ] like

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:08.800
empathy or some kind of like moral

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.080
superiority like

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.600
maybe you just want to be on the right

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:13.679
side of history now all that's gone

01:31:13.679 --> 01:31:15.760
now it's just [ __ ] like baseless

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.360
political snobbery

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:20.000
where it's like oh you want your job

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:20.880
back

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.800
well maybe you should get a job as a

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.560
doctor and it's like are you even

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.400
thinking about the [ __ ] words coming

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:29.040
out of your mouth you stupid [ __ ]

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:32.080
i mean it's it's whatever [ __ ] it yeah i

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:32.719
can't

01:31:32.719 --> 01:31:35.280
it's we'll do it get fired up dude the

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.719
atlantic this whole month

01:31:36.719 --> 01:31:39.360
was conspiracy theories it was just like

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.239
if you like

01:31:40.239 --> 01:31:43.199
question the news you're gonna kill that

01:31:43.199 --> 01:31:44.000
the idea of people

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.480
questioning the news is going to like

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:47.600
everyone's going to die from that

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.159
basically

01:31:48.159 --> 01:31:49.920
yeah well now the atlantic has to lay

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:52.320
off like like 20 to 40 percent of their

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.679
staff which is like good

01:31:53.679 --> 01:31:55.520
that's this is what i want it's good is

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.280
i want to see no i really do i want to

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.960
see like the [ __ ] people

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:01.440
in the media that sold this who like did

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.120
not do their due diligence and

01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.800
made specifically that argument that you

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.400
shouldn't that there should not be any

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.920
kind of alternative narrative

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.679
that there's no room for i mean

01:32:09.679 --> 01:32:10.960
youtube's like banning

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.199
banning people from youtube who are like

01:32:14.199 --> 01:32:16.560
epidemiologists they are they have

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.840
dissenting opinions

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.360
but they are the experts that we're

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.960
supposed to be listening to

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:24.239
because their opinion professionally

01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:27.120
runs counter to like whatever either

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.800
like a municipal government or a federal

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:30.480
government or whatever was decided

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:33.600
you know at like in some

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.920
level of the state is this is the

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:37.600
opinion that we have that lockdowns are

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.040
the answer they're wearing masks to the

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:39.600
answer

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.719
so if you have somebody that's an

01:32:40.719 --> 01:32:42.400
epidemiologist that goes on youtube and

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.400
says like well actually

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.480
no not really then they get [ __ ]

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.159
banned and people are on board with that

01:32:48.159 --> 01:32:49.679
idea and it's like on principle you

01:32:49.679 --> 01:32:50.960
should be fighting that

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:53.040
i mean like the the responsibility

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.639
should be on people to think critically

01:32:54.639 --> 01:32:55.920
for themselves and get all the

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:56.719
information

01:32:56.719 --> 01:33:00.400
it shouldn't be this top-down you know

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.239
even if even if these people are [ __ ]

01:33:02.239 --> 01:33:03.679
like completely wrong there should be

01:33:03.679 --> 01:33:05.199
room to be wrong about these things you

01:33:05.199 --> 01:33:05.679
know

01:33:05.679 --> 01:33:07.360
yeah it's just instead of that like for

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.280
like wine tooth smile of like

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:12.400
oh my god no spare me

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:15.760
so yeah it's [ __ ] sucks

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:19.040
you know i i and

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.480
none of the people who you would think

01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:22.560
would care care they just don't

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.440
they just they're like yeah stay home

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:25.840
save

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:26.710
lives

01:33:26.710 --> 01:33:29.440
[Laughter]

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.120
it's like yeah right it just actually

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.960
doesn't make sense to me

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:34.480
like when it comes to like the whole

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:36.239
stay home like i understand staying home

01:33:36.239 --> 01:33:37.440
doesn't spread the disease but i'm

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.880
saying like

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.800
we're gonna have to come out yeah

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.480
eventually

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.159
do we wait for a cure is that what the

01:33:44.159 --> 01:33:45.600
is that what they're saying that was the

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.199
premise from the get-go but now they

01:33:47.199 --> 01:33:48.880
realize that's [ __ ] untenable i mean

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.239
i haven't watched one of these kuomo

01:33:50.239 --> 01:33:52.800
briefings in in forever but it's like

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.320
what they're supposed to just lock down

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.639
new york city until there's a cure found

01:33:56.639 --> 01:33:57.040
now

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.480
there were studies there was that

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.400
grocery store test that said the 20

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:03.120
of new yorkers already had it the the

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.880
sample size of whatever that

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:08.159
20 21 of people in new york city have

01:34:08.159 --> 01:34:09.440
have the antibodies that are already

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:11.280
exposed to the virus but the the thing

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:11.679
that's

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.360
the fact that it's become a political

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.800
issue where it's like uh

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:16.480
one party believes you need to stay

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:18.159
inside one party believes

01:34:18.159 --> 01:34:20.639
it's like how are we this dumb that all

01:34:20.639 --> 01:34:22.400
all the democrats agree

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:24.480
and all the republicans agree that and

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:26.320
the media falls in line too like i just

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:28.639
looked at a cnn article about sweden

01:34:28.639 --> 01:34:30.880
and the headline was like sweden not

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:32.480
seeing the results that expected with

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:32.800
its

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.280
herd immunity idea yeah and then the

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:37.360
first quote like five paragraphs down of

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:37.920
course

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:40.480
was sweden being like yeah i mean the

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.239
the results were about off by about one

01:34:42.239 --> 01:34:44.159
percent but this is about exactly where

01:34:44.159 --> 01:34:47.040
we thought we'd be

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.679
why like why are you i don't know i just

01:34:49.679 --> 01:34:51.199
and and it's it's just like it's just

01:34:51.199 --> 01:34:52.000
like abortion

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.480
where there's both sides have like uh

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.280
like what you

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:57.760
you don't like babies yeah that's you

01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.040
and then the other side's like what you

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.400
don't like women

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:02.000
yeah like now with this argument it's

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.840
like what you don't you want

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:06.239
how many old people need to die so we

01:35:06.239 --> 01:35:08.960
can increase the gdp by 0.5 percent

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.800
absolutely everything how am i supposed

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:14.239
to argue that

01:35:14.239 --> 01:35:15.679
absolutely everything is [ __ ]

01:35:15.679 --> 01:35:17.440
political obviously but like

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.840
yeah this this one is like [ __ ] it's

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.199
it's absolutely fun

01:35:21.199 --> 01:35:24.239
this is a real issue this is like a like

01:35:24.239 --> 01:35:25.040
this is what

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:27.520
now now granted i don't think it is that

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:28.480
serious but

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:31.280
if it were serious we we see how our

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:33.040
government would react which is

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.199
we're going to instantly politicize this

01:35:35.199 --> 01:35:36.639
there's we're not together on any we're

01:35:36.639 --> 01:35:37.679
not going to be united

01:35:37.679 --> 01:35:40.239
if there was like a world war three our

01:35:40.239 --> 01:35:42.320
half our country we would suck but but

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.480
both parties were united both parties

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.639
were united instantaneously with the

01:35:46.639 --> 01:35:48.480
idea of passing a stimulus bill that

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.159
[ __ ] gives a bunch of money to large

01:35:50.159 --> 01:35:51.920
firms to [ __ ] over

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.159
smaller size firms barely [ __ ]

01:35:54.159 --> 01:35:55.199
extending

01:35:55.199 --> 01:35:57.119
you know unemployment insurance or

01:35:57.119 --> 01:35:58.639
protections to people

01:35:58.639 --> 01:36:00.800
and it's like that that's what you can

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.560
expect the system to do

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:05.199
and it works perfectly in that regard

01:36:05.199 --> 01:36:07.280
it's a [ __ ]

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.639
what's the number again like 2.2

01:36:08.639 --> 01:36:10.480
trillion whatever the first i like i

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:12.320
said i i just had to like

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:15.280
check out yeah i don't care i really

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.840
don't [ __ ] care

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:20.239
i just noticed you changed your name

01:36:20.239 --> 01:36:21.199
yeah

01:36:21.199 --> 01:36:23.920
i'm open i'm hoping other people don't

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.880
care either

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.639
i was there i'm just waiting for the

01:36:26.639 --> 01:36:28.400
[ __ ] to come back normal and it's like i

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:29.600
i don't ever want to hear about this

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.400
ever again

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:31.760
i do think people are going to try to

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.159
keep this alive as some sort of like

01:36:34.159 --> 01:36:35.280
thing like dude there's people already

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.719
talking about flu season now like well

01:36:36.719 --> 01:36:37.440
it's gonna be

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.719
flu season soon it's like dude nobody

01:36:38.719 --> 01:36:40.880
give a [ __ ] about flu season i said it i

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:41.760
said it a [ __ ]

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.440
like six weeks ago what's gonna happen

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.119
is red states are gonna open up first

01:36:45.119 --> 01:36:46.480
they'll be fine

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:48.239
the media i'm doing a show in like a

01:36:48.239 --> 01:36:50.000
week the media is gonna do every

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:50.880
missouri

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.480
the media is going to do everything they

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:54.320
can to paint it as like the worst case

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:55.920
scenario they're going to be like

01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:58.480
well texas it's a [ __ ] nightmare in

01:36:58.480 --> 01:36:59.520
texas but

01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:01.679
it'll be fine and they'll continue that

01:37:01.679 --> 01:37:03.760
narrative or whatever as long as they

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:04.800
have to

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:07.040
until the blue states you know new york

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:09.679
can reopen on their terms based on the

01:37:09.679 --> 01:37:10.880
science or the data

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:12.960
and it'll be an arbitrary [ __ ] point

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:14.480
probably shortly

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:17.920
after the election uh it's like

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.159
it's just [ __ ] stupid and all the

01:37:20.159 --> 01:37:21.760
people that lost their jobs are not

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.360
going to get their [ __ ] jobs back and

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.800
you're not going to hear about it

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.000
you know just before the election

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.199
they're going to need well i guess they

01:37:27.199 --> 01:37:29.040
can mail them in but

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.320
yeah maybe they'll get more votes with

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.000
mail-ins apparently democrats

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.400
traditionally win with mellon votes

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.320
or they democrat voters are more likely

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.560
to mail in their votes but yeah the uh

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.320
that's from what i heard i just think

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.320
after november the shit's going away

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.600
like this that's secure for it dude

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.639
they're talking it's like

01:37:44.639 --> 01:37:47.520
the the vaccine apparently is is genetic

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:48.560
from what i heard they

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.920
it's not like a weakened form of the

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:51.760
virus it's just they they tweak some

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:53.440
sort of genome and hit you with it it's

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:54.239
like

01:37:54.239 --> 01:37:55.840
so you guys are rushing to develop some

01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:57.520
sort of genetic manipulation it's like

01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:59.040
i'm cool

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.960
that's the other thing too is like this

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.960
oh yeah there's all these like these

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:03.600
these

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.679
data modelers that put this [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:06.880
out that say like

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.400
oh the uh the uh the the virus is uh

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.600
it's gonna kill

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.600
two million people if we don't do

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.880
anything or whatever

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.199
and then all of that's [ __ ] all of

01:38:17.199 --> 01:38:18.960
the data models are [ __ ] wrong

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.119
the first one the imperial college guy

01:38:21.119 --> 01:38:22.880
he released his code and people review

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:24.560
it and they're like this is dog [ __ ]

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.199
this is [ __ ] like refused to for a

01:38:27.199 --> 01:38:27.600
while

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:30.000
and i did and so and then i you know my

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.760
mentions were filled with months but

01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:34.000
for months with people being like uh i i

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
guess you just don't understand how data

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:36.880
models work

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:38.880
they're always wrong it's like then

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.440
don't listen to them

01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.040
you know they're like what the [ __ ]

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.880
person that said this [ __ ] is gonna

01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:45.520
happen

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:48.239
you did or somebody did or that was the

01:38:48.239 --> 01:38:49.840
reason we did all of this [ __ ]

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:52.159
if data models then great then you and

01:38:52.159 --> 01:38:54.320
your [ __ ] data friends can go

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:57.600
yes models you can go [ __ ] do all the

01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.119
modeling you want

01:38:59.119 --> 01:39:02.080
dude they had one [ __ ] work they had

01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:03.679
one where it was like

01:39:03.679 --> 01:39:05.760
oh one of the top so yeah you're right

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:06.719
they had the hundred two hundred

01:39:06.719 --> 01:39:07.199
thousand

01:39:07.199 --> 01:39:10.080
two points [ __ ] data models followed

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:13.199
by let people [ __ ] work

01:39:13.199 --> 01:39:15.600
hell yes there was another like two and

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.719
a half million people

01:39:16.719 --> 01:39:19.840
filed for for bulldog please go right

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.000
please go right wing dude it's not even

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.840
a it's not even a [ __ ] no it's not

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:26.000
i know it's not a right wing issue this

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.199
is fun

01:39:27.199 --> 01:39:29.520
it is absolutely not a [ __ ]

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:30.480
right-wing issue

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.239
people on the right are correct about

01:39:32.239 --> 01:39:34.000
this for the wrong reasons like they

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.280
have been

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.159
every [ __ ] time how dare you a big

01:39:38.159 --> 01:39:39.920
issue has come up in the last couple of

01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:40.400
years

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.560
covington catholic right by accident

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.600
jesse smollett

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.840
right by accident i mean it's like all

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.280
of these issues uva

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.239
the right correct by accident it's like

01:39:50.239 --> 01:39:51.920
if you bet red every single time on

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:53.600
roulette you're gonna hit a couple times

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.280
you're gonna hit a couple of times but

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.639
they gotta hide what happens

01:39:56.639 --> 01:39:58.000
they gotta and this is what keeps

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.840
[ __ ] trump in power forever it's the

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.280
same it's an extension of

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.040
trump himself which is like trump isn't

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:05.040
even really i mean he's just kind of

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.560
like a bad guy

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:10.080
who's lucky [ __ ] just

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.119
deez donnie casino he's the house

01:40:13.119 --> 01:40:15.199
you can't bet against him and it's like

01:40:15.199 --> 01:40:16.800
you know it is a rigged system but

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.000
there's like he's got this

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.080
this [ __ ] kind of weird luck there's

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.320
all like i i don't believe for a [ __ ]

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.480
second that like tucker carlson wouldn't

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.000
be telling people that they have to go

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.760
back to work and this is like

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:30.000
a violation of like you know civil

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.199
liberties or whatever

01:40:31.199 --> 01:40:34.000
if they're like if it was clear that

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:34.560
like

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.880
sorry this is convoluted my point is is

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.119
that i don't think that

01:40:39.119 --> 01:40:41.440
that a lot of people on the right who

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.960
truly believe that the virus is

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:44.000
overblown

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.840
wouldn't be saying these things if it

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.199
was clear that it wasn't

01:40:47.199 --> 01:40:49.199
you know what i mean yeah they would

01:40:49.199 --> 01:40:51.760
want people to go back to work and die

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.080
if you know even if this were real

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:55.360
they'd be doing the same thing

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.440
but they would just happen to me [ __ ]

01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.400
thing but it's

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.719
right so you're right you're right-wing

01:41:00.719 --> 01:41:02.639
i'm not right-wing the problem is this

01:41:02.639 --> 01:41:03.600
is that like

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.119
the so the system that we have is

01:41:05.119 --> 01:41:06.800
[ __ ] broken right i mean there's

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.400
there's a lot of problems but

01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:10.239
you know i want [ __ ] health care

01:41:10.239 --> 01:41:11.520
reform i think we should have

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:14.320
you know like full single-payer health

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:14.800
care

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.000
for me and that would just talk about

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.080
that today everybody should be covered

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.080
well we don't have that right now and

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.159
there's no real like path towards that

01:41:22.159 --> 01:41:23.119
[ __ ] happening

01:41:23.119 --> 01:41:24.800
so the system we have now is where

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.560
people are covered by

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:29.679
their employers right so like

01:41:29.679 --> 01:41:31.679
this thing comes up and you're talking

01:41:31.679 --> 01:41:32.800
about massive

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.800
[ __ ] job loss by shutting down the

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.639
economy and locking everybody in their

01:41:36.639 --> 01:41:38.080
homes and if you're concerned with

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:38.960
people

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.800
who need their [ __ ] health care if

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.800
that's a serious concern to you

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.480
you shouldn't you should not be a

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:46.880
[ __ ] accelerationist on this issue

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.719
it shouldn't be like oh yeah let's get

01:41:48.719 --> 01:41:49.920
all these people off their healthcare

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:51.600
and see how badly they get [ __ ] up and

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.560
hurt and die

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.600
if you're of that mentality then you're

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:57.440
i mean you're just a liberal you're just

01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:59.040
a [ __ ] you're a person that thinks

01:41:59.040 --> 01:41:59.440
that

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:02.400
poor people or working people should die

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:03.840
so that maybe there could be some kind

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.360
of progressive change that barely

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:06.960
benefits you but makes you feel better

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.159
about who you are

01:42:08.159 --> 01:42:10.560
and so it's like i don't yet there

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.600
there's there's

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:14.719
like a missing voice or opinion on the

01:42:14.719 --> 01:42:16.639
left about this whole [ __ ] thing

01:42:16.639 --> 01:42:19.760
that it's like it [ __ ] stinks and the

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.440
lockdowns are [ __ ] stupid

01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:23.040
and like you should have been fighting

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:24.639
this thing the entire [ __ ] time

01:42:24.639 --> 01:42:27.119
you just should have been like dragged

01:42:27.119 --> 01:42:28.880
kicking and streaming and having your

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:29.280
face

01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:30.880
shoved in the [ __ ] data that says

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:33.199
this virus is as deadly as they say it

01:42:33.199 --> 01:42:33.520
is

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.960
and the changes that we needed to make

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:36.800
were absolutely [ __ ] necessary

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.800
it's like the people on the left should

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:39.920
have had the [ __ ] courage to

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.600
criticize this the entire time

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.920
because the result is massive

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:45.679
joblessness there is no path forward

01:42:45.679 --> 01:42:46.159
towards

01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:47.920
you know people having health care it's

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:50.560

just like do you guys happen to notice

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.719
who the essential workers are

01:42:56.719 --> 01:42:59.520
yeah that's it that's the only response

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:00.560
i'm like oh my god

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:01.760
yeah i mean dude there was an article

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:04.239
recently saying like we

01:43:04.239 --> 01:43:07.280
to the effect of like yeah we know

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:09.280
you're not staying at home because we're

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:11.040
watching how close your cell phones are

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.639

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:33.679
nikola tesla's parents were chocolatiers

01:47:33.679 --> 01:47:33.920
that

01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:37.040
invented milk chocolate and i don't know

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.800
or some part of the milk chocolate

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.000
process

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.840
and i i just thought that and i would

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:44.159
repeat it for like 10 years

01:47:44.159 --> 01:47:48.639
and then not even remotely true

01:47:48.639 --> 01:47:50.320
it's not even like close they did

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.840
nothing with chocolate there's no

01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.000
evidence you can type in any variation

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.840
in nikola tesla chocolate it does

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:56.880
doesn't there's no

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.639
i have no idea where it [ __ ] came

01:47:58.639 --> 01:48:00.960

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:03.119
i can't asians definitely sick their

01:48:03.119 --> 01:48:04.960

dude did you scare your boss and he did

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:08.800
it

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:10.639
uh yeah it was what do you do what

01:48:10.639 --> 01:48:11.840
happened so

01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.679
he used to make me uh so i'm trying to

01:48:13.679 --> 01:48:15.280
get back to my okay so he used to make

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:15.600
me

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.679
empty the shitty paper so he was scared

01:48:17.679 --> 01:48:18.880
to flush the toilet paper down his

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:20.400
toilet because he i guess was like still

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:21.760
not used to american plumbing and he

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.600
swore if you flush toilet paper like the

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:24.560
whole like

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:26.480
toilet would explode so you'd wipe your

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:28.239
hair right he's right about that you'd

01:48:28.239 --> 01:48:29.760
wipe your ass and you put it in a thing

01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:30.639
and he'd make you go

01:48:30.639 --> 01:48:32.080
go invite the shitty paper so i would

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:34.320
take and i would throw the shitty paper

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.600
and then he would come back and like

01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.679
mess with me and the one time i did it

01:48:37.679 --> 01:48:39.040
and it fell out and started blowing

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:40.639
towards him he went

01:48:40.639 --> 01:48:42.639
he jumped back shitty paper flew towards

01:48:42.639 --> 01:48:43.679
him

01:48:43.679 --> 01:48:45.679
and then he did it again because we were

01:48:45.679 --> 01:48:47.280
throwing out fluorescent light bulbs

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:48.560
so we were throwing fluorescent light

01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:50.480
bulbs in a dumpster and he came by

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.400
oh the [ __ ] and he threw it in and i

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.080
think it like bounced off the edge and

01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:56.800
shattered in front of him

01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:00.960
he did it both times dude solid theory

01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:03.360

01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:49.360
[ __ ]

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.960
yeah just have to eat beets every

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:53.199
[ __ ] day every day of my life i eat

01:50:53.199 --> 01:50:54.320
beets

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:58.000
really disgusting

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.159
how high is the blood pressure it gets

01:51:00.159 --> 01:51:02.560
bad i mean a couple years ago

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:06.159
it was like 170 over 110 and then uh

01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:08.080
like i went to a cardiologist but i had

01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:10.159
been eating beets and i cut coffee out

01:51:10.159 --> 01:51:11.760
and i stopped doing cocaine in between

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:13.520
like going to urgent care and getting

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:14.880
the cardiologist

01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:16.400
so then at that point it was down to

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:19.520
like you know

01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:22.480
to 145 over like 100 or something and

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.520
she was like just keep an

01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:25.520
eye on it you know just like keep doing

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.360
whatever you're doing if it came down

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.119
and then you know i kept an eye on it

01:51:29.119 --> 01:51:30.560
and i [ __ ] kept eating beets and i

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:32.880
got it down to like 120 over 90.

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:34.560
and then i stopped checking and then i

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:36.159
checked it again like a month and a half

01:51:36.159 --> 01:51:37.280
ago and it was like

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:40.639
back up to like 150 145 150 over

01:51:40.639 --> 01:51:44.000
100 something so the beats start again

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
and i stopped doing cocaine so there you

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.199
go yeah

01:51:47.199 --> 01:51:48.880
that'll help that'll help that'll help

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.800
him immensely i'm sure

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:52.320
yeah but i stopped doing cocaine a while

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:54.080
ago so i don't know

01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:55.199
but it's yeah it's just my blood

01:51:55.199 --> 01:51:56.800
pressure my resting heart like my heart

01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:58.000
rate is like 50

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.719
you know it's like yeah i mean yeah i'm

01:52:00.719 --> 01:52:02.560
in good shape otherwise it's just by

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:04.159
[ __ ] just i'm high strung or some

01:52:04.159 --> 01:52:04.639
[ __ ]

01:52:04.639 --> 01:52:08.560
huh yeah start smoking weed

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.320
that raises your blood pressure does it

01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:12.639
really yeah and your heart rate

01:52:12.639 --> 01:52:14.560
so i feel like it does temporarily then

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.239
it drops it down

01:52:16.239 --> 01:52:17.599
yeah but see here's the thing and i

01:52:17.599 --> 01:52:19.199
think it's like because i used to love

01:52:19.199 --> 01:52:20.880
smoky weed i smoke weed all day every

01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:22.080
day and then i became

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:24.000
i don't know i got like when i got in my

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.679
20s and i just got too

01:52:25.679 --> 01:52:27.520
high strung for that [ __ ] and it's like

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:30.239
i can't i can't relax when i'm high

01:52:30.239 --> 01:52:32.719
yeah i can't relax like especially like

01:52:32.719 --> 01:52:35.040
once i became like self-employed

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:36.560
or whatever you however you want to

01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:38.159
describe yeah not

01:52:38.159 --> 01:52:40.800
employed it's really what i was just

01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:42.239
yeah once i didn't have a job but like

01:52:42.239 --> 01:52:43.119
you know i kind of

01:52:43.119 --> 01:52:44.960
you can you can't just stop working it's

01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.480
like i wake up and it's like okay what

01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.760
am i going to do today how am i going to

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:48.960
like what

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:50.880
like what what am i doing to advance my

01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:52.320
career or do my

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:54.000
thing or like [ __ ] have some kind of

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.599
creative output so there's not a single

01:52:55.599 --> 01:52:57.199
moment in the day where i'm like okay

01:52:57.199 --> 01:52:58.800
it's time to relax

01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:00.960
that just never i that does not occur

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.480
from six a.m when i wake up till

01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:04.000
midnight when i go to sleep there's not

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
a single moment where i feel like

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.679
i'm done that's why your [ __ ] blood

01:53:07.679 --> 01:53:09.440
pressure's so high dude yeah that's what

01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:10.800
i mean

01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:12.080
dude this is this is why i used to do

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:13.360
the same thing weed i smoke weed all the

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.080
time and i

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.400
just it's totally counterproductive if

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:17.679
you do it like once

01:53:17.679 --> 01:53:20.159
every two three weeks or once a month

01:53:20.159 --> 01:53:21.840
you just eat an edible smoke a bunch of

01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:23.360
wheat and just lay in like a dark room

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.880
with a mask on for like an hour and a

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:26.080
half that's how i think you're supposed

01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:27.679
to do it it's [ __ ] awesome i

01:53:27.679 --> 01:53:29.360
i smoked weed the other week and it was

01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:31.360
like just to do a test run and see how i

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:32.719
would feel high and it was just to get

01:53:32.719 --> 01:53:33.440
it out of the way

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:35.040
and it's like okay great well now i'm

01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:36.800
high

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:38.639
yeah see i think you have to like lay

01:53:38.639 --> 01:53:40.480
there and it's kind of

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:42.239
by itself of like getting stoned and

01:53:42.239 --> 01:53:43.679
like watching the simpsons i'm like yeah

01:53:43.679 --> 01:53:45.119
i don't really get anything out of it if

01:53:45.119 --> 01:53:46.560
you can lay there and just close your

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:47.520
eyes and just look because i

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:49.119
i can't really relax i'm always like

01:53:49.119 --> 01:53:50.880
dude i gotta do this i gotta do this

01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:53.199
yeah if i smoke a decent amount of weed

01:53:53.199 --> 01:53:54.560
and lay and just like listen to music

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:56.400
and just completely tell myself like

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:59.119
i am not i'm done i actually am relaxing

01:53:59.119 --> 01:54:00.560
it's i find it very really i find it

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.000
very nice maybe i'll try that

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.760
because honestly i do need to like calm

01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.599
the [ __ ] down it's setting attention

01:54:05.599 --> 01:54:07.440
setting the intention to calm down

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.119
smoke a bunch of weed and just lay there

01:54:09.119 --> 01:54:12.080
it really sucks i have a very nice life

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:14.159
i have like a [ __ ] very nice life and

01:54:14.159 --> 01:54:16.400
my the biggest problem in my life is

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:18.159
that i know that i can't enjoy it

01:54:18.159 --> 01:54:20.880
and there's no reason for me not to and

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.000
it [ __ ] it like

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.719
kills me it's like it is [ __ ]

01:54:24.719 --> 01:54:26.320
infuriating

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:28.080
look look in a relational frame look

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:29.760
into rft it's relational frame theory

01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:31.119
it's how like all of your sufferings

01:54:31.119 --> 01:54:32.800
tied to language and if you try to cure

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:34.239
your suffering you can only do it with

01:54:34.239 --> 01:54:35.360
language which reminds you of your

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:37.040
suffering which makes it increase

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.320
pretty [ __ ] sick i think you'd be

01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.239
into it you have a very analytical mind

01:54:40.239 --> 01:54:44.560
behind bulletproof glass constantly yeah

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:46.159
look into that it's pretty cool though

01:54:46.159 --> 01:54:47.520
this whole world out of reach and the

01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:49.040
only thing i can do is like lean

01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:52.560
further into like uh like

01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:55.760
you know like self-denial or delayed

01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:57.440
gratification or whatever

01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:59.599
just [ __ ] like restricting myself or

01:54:59.599 --> 01:55:01.760
controlling things

01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.360
you know like going on like a [ __ ]

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:04.880
diet or not drinking

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:06.800
or any of these things i just like you

01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:08.320
know it's just because i know if i did

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:11.520
it i wouldn't enjoy it enough

01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:14.639
hell yeah yeah i'm telling you dude it's

01:55:14.639 --> 01:55:15.520
it's uh

01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:18.400
i was reading about this they talk it's

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:20.000
called the [ __ ] framework

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.239
[ __ ] recharge frame theory yeah how to

01:55:22.239 --> 01:55:25.199
think like a [ __ ]

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.119
i'm just do a self-help book and just

01:55:27.119 --> 01:55:29.280
i'm gonna self-publish a self-help book

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:29.760
with me

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:32.159
on the front you know and like a nice

01:55:32.159 --> 01:55:33.599
like blue button up

01:55:33.599 --> 01:55:36.000
and it says [ __ ] mind [ __ ] penis

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:36.330
and just

01:55:36.330 --> 01:55:38.000
[Laughter]

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.000
just sneak it onto the carousel

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
drop it right there next to tony robbins

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.840
[ __ ] mind [ __ ]

01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:50.080
it's like somebody trying to pick that

01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:52.000
up and get a ring rung up but kiko's

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:52.560
like yeah

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:55.680
um i don't think we actually sell this

01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:58.320
[Laughter]

01:55:58.320 --> 01:55:59.599
you know what i don't think this is

01:55:59.599 --> 01:56:02.719
actually one of our products oh [ __ ] it

01:56:02.719 --> 01:56:04.080
i've never seen this guy in my life i

01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:07.119
don't know where this book came from

01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:10.639
you should do that that's good i uh i

01:56:10.639 --> 01:56:13.599
did uh did i talk about matt i did

01:56:13.599 --> 01:56:14.080
therapy

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:17.280
did we talk about that you told me yeah

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:20.480
it's all right yeah it's it's great

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:21.920
yeah i've never i've never done it yeah

01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:23.199
that's when we got under the insurance

01:56:23.199 --> 01:56:26.159
thing because it was like 200 bucks

01:56:26.159 --> 01:56:28.800
i don't yeah it's such a good thing to

01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.400
do and it's just so funny that it's so

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:32.800
expensive because the person's

01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:35.280
only overhead is just a room just not

01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:36.239
even like an apartment

01:56:36.239 --> 01:56:37.679
it's just a room this was a phone call

01:56:37.679 --> 01:56:39.280
this was a phone call yeah and it's like

01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:41.599
dude how is this 250 [ __ ] dollars for

01:56:41.599 --> 01:56:42.000
an hour

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.520
like what yeah i stopped going to my

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:47.920
psychiatrist in result

01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:49.360
well she would probably refill the

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:51.440
prescription if i asked her to but

01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:54.639
she uh yeah like i had one time i went

01:56:54.639 --> 01:56:56.080
and it was like it was like three

01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:57.840
hundred dollars for a 45 dollar session

01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:58.880
every time i saw her

01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:01.920
so i would go look once every two months

01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:04.400
three months you know i mean it's like

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:05.920
i'm not there's no way that's gonna be a

01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:07.520
regular thing

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:10.080
yeah it's [ __ ] crazy and so and i

01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:11.679
went one time and it was like i could

01:57:11.679 --> 01:57:12.800
only meet for like

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:15.199
25 minutes and she was like ah you know

01:57:15.199 --> 01:57:16.400
don't worry about i'm like oh great you

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:17.599
know because i was just checking in and

01:57:17.599 --> 01:57:19.040
for the most part it's like

01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:20.800
i don't like i don't go to therapy

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.239
because it's like the process of

01:57:22.239 --> 01:57:24.960
shopping for a [ __ ] therapist is like

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:26.000
[ __ ] you know

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.239
like a lot of like i guess the couple

01:57:28.239 --> 01:57:29.360
i've seen are just

01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:31.440
like i don't get anything out of it

01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:33.440
right away and it's like

01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:36.000
okay well then i shouldn't have to pay

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.040
you

01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:40.159
yeah it's like if this

01:57:40.159 --> 01:57:42.159
sucked i mean this should they're like

01:57:42.159 --> 01:57:43.520
all you did was talk

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:46.080
you know it's not like you [ __ ] did

01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:47.280
the oil change

01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:50.400
you know you [ __ ] it up i

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.159
you know it's like you did you just sat

01:57:52.159 --> 01:57:53.360
there and you said well how does that

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.320
make you feel

01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:56.239
you know it's like i could do that

01:57:56.239 --> 01:57:58.960
myself yeah i mean i feel like

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:01.040
like probably 80 percent of therapy you

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.000
can do yourself

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.080
there's 20 that where they can really

01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:05.840
offer some insight and like you know

01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:07.360
think critically about like what's going

01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:07.920
on and

01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:10.639
and really help you but like that's i

01:58:10.639 --> 01:58:12.000
mean you're you're gonna have to like

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.040
look for that

01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:14.880
yeah but for the price of a like a

01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:17.040
mortgage monthly like a thousand bucks a

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:18.000
month it's like dude

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.760
i have a house for that you're you're

01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:21.280
telling me the thing you're doing for me

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:22.000
provides a

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.840
thousand dollars a month worth of value

01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:25.920
it's like right i don't know man that

01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:27.040
that's like in a

01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:28.880
that's like an engineer makes x amount

01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:30.239
of dollars an hour you're making

01:58:30.239 --> 01:58:32.880
200 [ __ ] dollars an hour yeah you're

01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:33.599
making like

01:58:33.599 --> 01:58:36.880
backpage call girl rate

01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:38.960
yeah they're exactly reframing what you

01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.000
that's what they i went to school for

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
social work and they train you

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.599
just to reframe things like you said

01:58:43.599 --> 01:58:45.760
like sounds like you're very upset that

01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:47.440
sounds very upsetting to you

01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:49.599
right it's like it's like no [ __ ] dude

01:58:49.599 --> 01:58:51.440
no [ __ ]

01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:53.440
it's like it's like what can i do to

01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:55.520
change my behavior tell me right now

01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:58.000
give me something to make me not upset

01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.280
tell me how to think about it

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:00.000
differently

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.760
i don't need somebody to validate my

01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:03.520
[ __ ] feelings i'm fine with them on

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:04.880
my own

01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:07.440
you know you just don't really get that

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:09.119
yeah well they they're uh

01:59:09.119 --> 01:59:12.960
i mean i was talking to a guy recently

01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:16.159
it's funny the story with the the the

01:59:16.159 --> 01:59:17.840
the psychiatrist so the next time i went

01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:19.840
to see her you know i had a full 45

01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:21.520
minute session and she's like so we'll

01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:24.080
just do 600 and it'll like we'll

01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:26.159
grab the one from last time and i was

01:59:26.159 --> 01:59:27.119
like

01:59:27.119 --> 01:59:28.880
okay well i guess this will be the last

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:31.360
meeting i ever come yeah

01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:34.080
the [ __ ] yeah it is it is weird to end a

01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:34.880
session

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:36.400
after you're like telling somebody about

01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:38.159
your life and then it's like well my

01:59:38.159 --> 01:59:40.719
rates are usually about 250 an hour

01:59:40.719 --> 01:59:43.360
you're just like oh [ __ ] man yeah well

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:44.480
they've been crazy i should have bought

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:45.520
an xbox

01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:47.599
exactly dude i think i should have just

01:59:47.599 --> 01:59:49.119
bought something that made me happy real

01:59:49.119 --> 01:59:51.040
quick i bought a dirt bike dude

01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:53.199
yeah i could have bought a dirt bike and

01:59:53.199 --> 01:59:54.480
given it to a kid

01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:57.360
yeah yeah it's just in a neighborhood

01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:58.080
yeah man

01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:00.480
you could bought a kid i'm telling you

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:01.119
well then

02:00:01.119 --> 02:00:02.960
the worst part is is like that guy the

02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:04.880
psychiatrist at their best

02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:07.040
has to pin uh some sort of thing from

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:09.199
the dsm which in the dsm

02:00:09.199 --> 02:00:12.400
i think at like in 1973 gay was a

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:13.360
disease

02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:16.080
so like there's a book where in 1973 if

02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:17.360
you're gay they're like oh yeah you're

02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:19.199
gay like that's a mental disorder

02:00:19.199 --> 02:00:20.800
and that same book is what they diagnose

02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:22.239
people out of now so it's like they just

02:00:22.239 --> 02:00:23.679
change all the time like oh wait no that

02:00:23.679 --> 02:00:25.040
one was [ __ ] sorry about that

02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:28.400
everybody that one wasn't real

02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:30.320
but then they charge you they they hit

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:31.679
you with a label and then that way they

02:00:31.679 --> 02:00:33.360
can build insurance the whole system

02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:34.880
is absolutely [ __ ] it makes no

02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:36.560
[ __ ] sense anymore

02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:39.760

02:01:20.719 --> 02:01:22.080
to get out there and talk to people and

02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:23.599
let people like kind of call you on

02:01:23.599 --> 02:01:24.080
stuff

02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:25.679
but i just don't know why it's so

02:01:25.679 --> 02:01:27.199
[ __ ] expensive man

02:01:27.199 --> 02:01:30.159
yeah look i got a question i just uh

02:01:30.159 --> 02:01:31.840
this has been weird last night i agreed

02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:33.119
to do helium

02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:37.840
yeah st louis in like a week

02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:40.159
i mean do they have to like cap uh

02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:41.199
venues yeah

02:01:41.199 --> 02:01:44.719
yeah it's gonna be like 90 people max

02:01:44.719 --> 02:01:48.000
in like a 300 seater and then spread

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.440
them out and i think they're going to be

02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.199
wearing masks

02:01:51.199 --> 02:01:53.280
and so it's going to be [ __ ] nuts how

02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:55.280
do they compensate you for that

02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:59.040
i mean poorly if that's how the deal is

02:01:59.040 --> 02:01:59.679
and it's like

02:01:59.679 --> 02:02:03.119
you should get 100 of the door

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:05.679
yeah he should no i'm getting less than

02:02:05.679 --> 02:02:06.320
i would

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.400
uh regardless well they can't eat or

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:09.840
drink can they

02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:13.040
sorry uh i think they're working on that

02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:14.639
you slide a mask up and like

02:02:14.639 --> 02:02:16.480
take a bite of spinach yeah i think

02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:17.840
that's i mean restaurants certain

02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:18.960
