WEBVTT

00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.540
what up everybody this is episode 2

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.270
psych naw we laid the blueprint last

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.700
episode now we're building the wall I

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.019
don't know I don't I'm out of building

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.420
analogies already but we're moving

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.790
onward and I think we are making the

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.730
next logical step that I think will get

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.070
this thing off the ground as fast as

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.070
possible I'm here with my boy Michael

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.740
hey how's it going man so brother and I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.599
will yeah so this is my boy Michael and

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.010
a lot of times we get experts to come

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.510
and talk to us and you know the cast is

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.399
too hot so you know don't go looking for

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.190
them what's going on bro it's going good

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.230
man I got really excited about the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.850
framework that you outlined in the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.469
previous podcast I think that

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.629
peer-to-peer programs are the future so

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.820
I'm you know willing and able to help in

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.390
any way I can

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.910
hell yeah well you're the one you you

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.829
turned me on to Act which you know as

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.390
soon as I start reading about first of

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.329
all the first book I think the the book

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.760
you emailed me I looked into that and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.260
one of the quotes from the top authors

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.340
or one of the you know they could have

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.840
like three authors like quotes from them

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.449
one of them was the all M Scott pick

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.799
road less traveled I just read that and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.000
was raving about that book so I'm like

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.470
through this is quite as rare that the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.930
stuff I'm into actually like you know

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.580
catches on in a way if that makes sense

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.320
like oh [ __ ] I thought I didn't know

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.939
anyone read that book I mean I know it's

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.560
a best-seller but you know I thought it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.409
was like I'm sorry grad no yeah you know

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.820
I just thought like you know em Scott

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.229
Peck I mean the book uh my god this is

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.430
like you know this is a forgotten there

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.509
would have nobody cares about this

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.700
anymore but then I see that as the like

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.380
you know that it seems that's like an

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.030
important author to the person writing

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.500
this book that you recommend it I'm like

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.880
dude what you know what the [ __ ] is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.650
crazy yeah I think you're gonna be a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.630
surprised about you know the stuff

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.610
you're into and how it you know works

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.140
really well with some of these concepts

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.240
I'm excited to talk to you about it yeah

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.070
man please that's I would help was I I

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.140
want to in terms of the group format

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.210
after you you know after you introduced

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.649
me to act a little bit I've read about

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.270
it I'm like this is the this is it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.220
this'll be the way we can it so being a

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.840
very easy and understandable way to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.000
frame a lot of the work around something

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.740
at least initially but I do think it's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.469
awesome yeah so I think the the best the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.390
first thing to start out you know

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.770
talking about acceptance and commitment

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.320
therapy is you know what it tries to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.200
target which is psychological in

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.450
flexibility so you know there's a lot of

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.890
therapies out there like

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.960
behavioral therapy you know it's really

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.420
popular for depression and anxiety then

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.310
you have more exposure therapies which

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.350
you know more specific to anxiety

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.550
disorder

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.860
prolonged exposure more specific to PTSD

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.810
and then you have cognitive processing

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.050
therapy specifically for PTSD AK doesn't

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.350
look at things in the same way so in the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.660
context of what they're looking for is

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.060
that there's this there's this idea of

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.290
psychological inflexibility and that

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.000
could apply to a lot of different types

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.770
of symptoms including depression anxiety

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.430
PTSD just in different ways because

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.200
obviously depression is different than

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.440
anxiety which is different than PTSD so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.140
the best way to start out by explaining

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.300
psychological inflexibility is these

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.640
three terms first when you're

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.739
psychologically inflexible you're closed

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.260
off from your internal experiences and

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.480
you're closed off from things that cause

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.160
you to have these extra distressing

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.040
experiences your mindless so your

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.480
mindless of the present you're

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.550
oftentimes living in the past or you

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.860
know focus towards the future I mean

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.660
you're also mindless of how your

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.340
development or how you grow up as

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.110
impacted the way you view yourself in

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.890
the world and then the last term is

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.470
disconnected so if you're

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.400
psychologically inflexible you're

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.620
disconnected from your values so you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.329
have like a lack of values clarity like

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.190
what's important to you and you're also

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.840
engaging in behaviors that are

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.670
disconnected from your values this could

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.950
be avoidance behaviors like not being

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.110
able to go to a movie theater because

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.610
you're afraid of being in large crowds

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.799
or I'm gonna engage in a lot of

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.440
substance use because it helps me you

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.269
know forget about the things that are

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.090
causing me to have the most distress but

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.040
you know all these things that you know

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.200
go into psychological and flexibility

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.110
kind of are interconnected but that's

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.630
kind of a basic overview of you know

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.870
what psychological and flexibility is it

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.430
was basically not yeah I know I know

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.049
what you're saying one of the books I

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.660
think I was reading hate the one you

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.729
sent me or maybe one of them based off

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.440
the same thing I forget excited I spaz

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.900
and downloaded a bunch of books I do the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.820
same thing yeah and I started reading

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.169
them and the thing that was really cool

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.400
they were saying that

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.380
some Harvard study according to some

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.669
Harvard study they say we spent about

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.250
50% of our lives daydreaming yeah which

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.260
is you know I'm like yeah I could see

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.240
that I think I spent about 89 percent

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.990
but it's like the idea of not being

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.910
connected like you know say like I'm

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.139
sitting there you know I'm in my kitchen

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.520
I'm doing dishes I'm bugging out about

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.590
all are you are you there yeah I can

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.790
still hear you cool cause I saw you

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.520
froze up the idea of like you were that

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.889
idea is so simple but it's like you know

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.690
I can be sitting there like yesterday

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.860
was Mother's Day I'm doing Mother's Day

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.590
stuff you know I start getting stressed

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.120
out about something and then I can sit

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.760
there and I might as well be inside of a

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.440
stressful situation when in reality it's

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.850
like I'm doing the dishes we're about to

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.680
have a barbecue everything is actually

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.080
completely fine you know that's kind of

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.820
I like that shift to being like

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.680
constantly focusing on the present

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.820
moment as much as you can and then

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.650
figuring out what is the thing that's

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.880
pulling you out of your present moment

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.950
that's make literally making your heart

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.110
race you know your cortisol spike when

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.940
in reality you're just a dude sitting in

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.639
a room who's just eaten who's you know

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.710
inside of a shelter like perfectly fine

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.850
yeah

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.220
so that's crazy yeah it's these

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.139
attachments that we have to the past or

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.700
the fear of the future that kind of keep

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.700
us stuck you know not focusing on the

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.830
present I'd like to even kind of dissect

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.870
this down a little bit more because I

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.030
think maybe as you read these concepts

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.919
are even more specific than just being

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.470
closed off mindless and disconnected so

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.120
within the framework of feeling closed

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.099
off there's two concepts that actually

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:55.620
tries to hit at it's one who's

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.520
experiential avoidance so oftentimes you

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.280
know we avoid things that cause us a lot

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.220
of distress and we occupy our times we

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.550
occupy our day trying to control those

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.260
thoughts and those memories from coming

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.910
back so that we don't have to experience

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.210
those distressing experiences and right

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.130
along the side that we have this concept

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.160
called cognitive fusion now it's kind of

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.690
a weird word to say because it's not

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.460
something that we talk about too often

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.740
but I think the best way to explain it

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.750
as you know to kind of give an example

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.500
so I want you to imagine I don't have a

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.479
glass sitting next to you or something

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:34.800
along those lines but I want you to

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.919
imagine that that glass is full of a cup

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.230
of saliva

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.670
I want you to look at that cup of saliva

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.370
and I want you to imagine that cup of

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.380
saliva that you're about to take a drink

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.690
of it and once it enters your lips I

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.730
want you to try to taste the saliva how

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.270
it's warm thick you know a lot of times

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.890
when patients go through that process

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.990
they say that that sounds kind of

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.540
disgusting well that's what it is I just

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.430
used language and imagery in order to

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.580
you know evoke the emotion of disgust

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.440
and that's what we call in language

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.870
cognitive fusion now it's an adaptive

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.400
trait because if I say something along

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.870
the lines of oh there's a snake over

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.550
there you automatically have a startle

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.810
response because you don't want to get

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.240
bitten by the snake but if you have like

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.620
let's say a significant amount in

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.820
anxiety

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.510
that could be like I don't feel safe in

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.790
this environment and so I am going to

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.320
try to avoid that as much as I possibly

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.410
can so your thoughts the language that

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.350
you use to kind of identify these issues

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.970
are fused with your emotions which

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.130
ultimately leads you to avoid Bing's or

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.320
tried to control things and that's what

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.140
in acceptance and commitment therapy we

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.860
attribute to most of human suffering

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.680
yeah okay so when you said just so I so

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.960
I understand yeah

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.450
so this so the ability to kind of get

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.740
yourself you know and like I think they

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.330
said to it goes both ways you can think

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.680
good things and make yourself feel great

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.090
or you're going to be thinking horrible

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.410
things all day and making yourself feel

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.250
horrible and the idea is to just accept

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.260
the things that are making you feel like

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.760
just accept they're there they're

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.130
present and then using reframing I guess

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.500
you know how you interact with language

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.480
or even how much credence you give the

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.300
language that's running through you and

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.580
the way to diffuse that is what you know

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.920
according to what I've seen is or what

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.620
I've read is to constantly strive to be

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.850
in touch with that present moment of

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.380
like what are you actually doing what

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.220
are you actually not what are you

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.780
thinking about what are you doing right

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.050
now

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.340
right yet totally so you know with with

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.590
you know the the flip side a cognitive

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.500
fusion is cognitive diffusion so enact

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.390
what we try to help teach patients to do

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.030
is to be able to identify their thoughts

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.400
and to decide whether or not they're

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.800
workable or unworkable it's not like the

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.660
thought is either true or false or bad

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.769
or good it's whether or not those

00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:53.970
thoughts keep you connected with the

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.189
things that are important to you and the

00:08:56.189 --> 00:08:57.929
best way to achieve that is like what

00:08:57.929 --> 00:09:00.149
you were saying is by being present as

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:02.369
being you know able to identify when

00:09:02.369 --> 00:09:04.559
those thoughts come up and to make a

00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:05.910
decision on whether or not you're gonna

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.649
entertain those thoughts or if you're

00:09:07.649 --> 00:09:09.329
gonna acknowledge that they're there and

00:09:09.329 --> 00:09:10.410
kind of let them go

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.449
yeah well this again this was the weird

00:09:12.449 --> 00:09:14.069
Ann I always would rail on about this

00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:17.819
but it's like you know when I would so

00:09:17.819 --> 00:09:19.170
when I would have like I always say I

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.989
when I was younger like 23 24 started

00:09:21.989 --> 00:09:23.369
just out of nowhere so he didn't sue

00:09:23.369 --> 00:09:26.040
parang shis panic attacks like . go to

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.720
school have to leave all that avoidance

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.769
stuff you're talking about like I'm in

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:30.509
school all I can you know I'm fine I'm

00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:32.220
sitting there all I can think about it

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.839
I'm gonna have another panic attack I'd

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:36.269
freak out I go leave class and then it's

00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:37.889
like I started you know I was like yeah

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:39.480
I smoke weed since I was like you know

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.459
14 years old I always liked it and then

00:09:41.459 --> 00:09:43.079
I couldn't enjoy it anymore because it

00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:45.089
would make me bug out and it sounds so

00:09:45.089 --> 00:09:47.999
silly but it's like I would be you know

00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:50.129
out somewhere I would eat an edible it

00:09:50.129 --> 00:09:51.869
would kick in and I would just be like

00:09:51.869 --> 00:09:53.339
in the bathroom at the movie theaters

00:09:53.339 --> 00:09:56.910
like holy [ __ ] this is it I did it you

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.889
know like my wife's gonna know what I

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:00.600
did or she's gonna like she knows what I

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.980
did but she's gonna be like what what's

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.259
wrong with you and then I remembered

00:10:04.259 --> 00:10:05.459
it's thinking it literally and this was

00:10:05.459 --> 00:10:07.350
before I like write about any stuff like

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.660
yeah what if I told myself I was fine

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.339
and that actually like everything's

00:10:11.339 --> 00:10:13.170
awesome I did that I instantly felt

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.699
better which is almost disorienting once

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:15.959
you realize like like you were saying

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:19.799
how much how much the language you're

00:10:19.799 --> 00:10:21.329
running through your head and it's not

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.980
even just you it's like that you know

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.689
because it comes from what are ft right

00:10:24.689 --> 00:10:26.730
is that like the base frame theory right

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.799
and that's and that's basically you know

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:30.809
that's probably getting too much in the

00:10:30.809 --> 00:10:31.199
weeds

00:10:31.199 --> 00:10:33.179
that's sure but the cool idea again and

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:34.499
I don't again I'm not an expert in any

00:10:34.499 --> 00:10:36.059
of this right now but the idea is that

00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:37.439
you're kind of bopping around you're

00:10:37.439 --> 00:10:39.059
generating your own language inside of

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:41.040
you that's all been affected by the

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.600
language you've been around all the time

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.309
the language continued to put yourself

00:10:44.309 --> 00:10:46.049
around and like that kind of that stuff

00:10:46.049 --> 00:10:48.089
you know I've said all the time we're

00:10:48.089 --> 00:10:50.790
not as a impermeable as we think like

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.379
we're absorbing [ __ ] all the time

00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:53.699
and it's like when you're absorbing the

00:10:53.699 --> 00:10:55.439
language like that it just it's weird to

00:10:55.439 --> 00:10:56.699
think that that would be something that

00:10:56.699 --> 00:10:58.679
would kind of live inside you that you

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:01.679
can alter right and you know that kind

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:03.480
of speaks to the reason why that we have

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.879
these processes is because if we look at

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:06.330
the

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.650
the second you know thing within

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.460
psychological and flexibility the

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.130
mindlessness you know there's this term

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.840
of being attached to the conceptualized

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.310
self it's pretty similar to like

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.260
cognitive behavioral therapy like core

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.110
beliefs ya receive ourselves and the

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.610
reason why it's hard for us to break out

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.350
of that cycle of language that's causing

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.750
us to have a lot of this human suffering

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.310
is because we're attached to it it's

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:31.490
something that we fundamentally believe

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.540
because of our development and because

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.130
of the relations that we developed over

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.980
time and one of the things that we try

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.930
to do with an act is to make them aware

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.960
of the conceptualized self and to

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:48.120
ultimately drop the conceptualization to

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.250
you know let go of the conceptualized

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.900
self and the way that we do that is

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.040
through teaching people's self

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.310
compassion and ultimately empathy

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.270
because I'm sorry go ahead

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.730
no no no I don't cut you off I'm curious

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.990
when you say they can sub-tree lie self

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.480
that would be that'd be like an

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.190
inherently negative conception of the

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.960
self and harun lee positive or just like

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.570
is it like an idealized well yeah I mean

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.640
in all these you know there could be a

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.430
flipside of positive but even then if

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.140
you like have too much grandiose

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.120
thinking about you probably a point

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.820
where that can be pretty bad but within

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.190
this framework usually it's more

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.620
negative like you know you know this you

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.450
know you can translate it to even like

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.180
post-traumatic stress disorder where you

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.890
know this bad thing happened to me

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.680
therefore I'm not safe in education is

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.230
that's similar to it and that drives a

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.520
lot of your thinking because you're

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.390
attached to it

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.110
there's no more things that we try to do

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.030
within act is you know I'm a big

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.590
proponent of it you don't actually need

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.720
to do a ton of it is formal mindfulness

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.360
training and once you go through that

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.670
formal mindfulness practice and you kind

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.980
of are able to diffuse from your

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.170
thoughts become willing to experience

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.450
those negative emotions you start to

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.430
build that self compassion for yourself

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.800
and empathy for people around you and

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.320
that helps to build what we call a self

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.990
as context which is you're not attached

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.750
to anything you're not attached to the

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.170
way that you perceive yourself you're

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.570
focused on the moment and you're focused

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.079
on you

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:22.790
what behaviors can help keep you

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.110
connected to the things that are

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.870
important to you and that's difficult to

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.529
do when you don't think you are worthy

00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:33.589
of things or you know I'm sure no

00:13:33.589 --> 00:13:35.480
absolutely and I also you know it is

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.769
kind of and now you say that yeah it

00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:38.180
doesn't make any nobody's gonna be like

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.550
damn I'm so awesome and the guy I need

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.910
to hit a groove yeah yeah that uh no

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.380
that's cool and it so it to me and again

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.810
this is the boiled down version it I

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.350
seem to be getting is like you know kind

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:52.579
of pulling people out of their own

00:13:52.579 --> 00:13:54.980
abstraction of themselves which is

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.600
usually negative to where they're mostly

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.760
living in their head about the past or

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.010
the future worrying about it or dwelling

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.990
on the past getting depressed taking

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.329
people out of that putting them into a

00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:07.610
present moment state based on their

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.010
actual values mm-hmm though then

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:11.899
generate them to basically just accept

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:14.269
who they actually are and then live a

00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:16.279
life based on the things that they

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:18.110
actually value rather than it's

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.420
constantly reacting to like a void pain

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.370
and conflict and that's the connected

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.470
part so this act fundamentally is a

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.810
behavior therapy yes if you're able to

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.360
stay connected with your values and you

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.190
have values clarity so you know what's

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.930
important to you then you're able to

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.329
develop these patterns of committed

00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:37.459
action which is actions that are in line

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:39.680
with your values so there's a few

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.420
different like you know sometimes you

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.459
hear the you know there's these goals

00:14:43.459 --> 00:14:45.319
that we have and we try to achieve those

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:47.990
goals with an act what we are trying to

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.510
achieve is valued living so are we

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.010
living within the directions of our

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.100
values and you know the actions that we

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.110
take along those steps could help us to

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.810
achieve our goals they probably will but

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.579
that's not really the point the point is

00:15:01.579 --> 00:15:02.870
to be in line with the things that are

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.630
important to you got you I see what

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.630
you're saying so yeah it's not like a I

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.370
mean I think I said too there's a

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.779
version of this that's kind of like a

00:15:11.779 --> 00:15:13.490
professional goals driven thing but this

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.019
could be something just to get you

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:17.180
thinking in that way to where you're in

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.459
touch with and this is it sounds kind of

00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:21.079
simple but it's like dude I've spent I

00:15:21.079 --> 00:15:24.050
don't man I've spent easily a decade and

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.750
a half serving agendas that weren't

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.459
intrinsically valuable to me just stuff

00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:29.870
that I'd kind of taken in and be like oh

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.339
I got to do this I'm gonna major in

00:15:31.339 --> 00:15:32.540
business I want to make money out of it

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.040
and like you can

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.089
that's right I think a lot of people end

00:15:35.089 --> 00:15:36.769
up freaking out ways are so alienated

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.540
from their own not even that they've

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.029
never even sat and try to conceptualize

00:15:41.029 --> 00:15:43.339
what they actually value in a way that

00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:44.720
could shape their life direction that

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.860
wouldn't leave them feeling like a

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.509
stranger to themselves by the times of

00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:49.579
50 years old I can completely relate

00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:51.560
because you know up until I started

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.120
actually you know trying act as a

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.160
therapy with patients you know I was

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.889
very focused on not failing that was

00:15:57.889 --> 00:16:00.110
like what drove me that's what kind of

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.300
made me work as hard as I did but it was

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.430
like there is a cycle anxiety that I

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.430
bought into and you know by practicing

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.110
mindfulness by doing these things with

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.029
patients I was funding Li fundamentally

00:16:11.029 --> 00:16:13.430
helping myself kind of get out of that

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.000
cycle anxiety that I was you know doing

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.620
for a long time you know ever since I

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.069
was a kid

00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:21.110
yeah and it's almost telling you it's

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.410
almost disconcerting once thing once you

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.910
kind of get a handle on yourself and

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.170
then I talk about that in the road less

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.970
traveled once you realize like oh no

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.620
this is up to me I can't put my head in

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.420
the sand and try to just like you know

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.310
go along with things and you know do

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.079
your whole life of like well I'll just

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:37.519
do this thing and you know quietly

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:39.050
resent it the whole time and be anxious

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.550
and to be depressed once you wake up and

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.380
you're like oh no I have to like shape

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.449
this thing from sunup to sundown and

00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:46.850
like deal with the things that are going

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.430
on inside of me and not like the ability

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.500
to automatically avoid situations that I

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.959
can do to avoid conflict is unbelievable

00:16:53.959 --> 00:16:55.279
once it gets pointed out to you it's

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:56.779
terrifying because you're like oh [ __ ]

00:16:56.779 --> 00:16:58.670
I have to like deal with all of this

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.130
stuff head-on otherwise I get trapped in

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.260
just like circumstances of other

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.209
people's desires and plans and then I'm

00:17:05.209 --> 00:17:06.530
like what the hell this happened how did

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.819
my life end up this way it's because you

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.679
buried your head in the sand and didn't

00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:12.020
confront the actual reality around you

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.630
because you're so lost in an abstraction

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.760
of like what if the past what's this

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.159
person that you know it it's crazy man

00:17:19.159 --> 00:17:21.110
it is really insane and that's the

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.360
acceptance piece of acceptance and

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.040
commitment therapy is you know through

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.990
acceptance and mindfulness practices

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.960
we're able to confront things in a way

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.850
that keeps us connected with the things

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.530
that are important to us as opposed to

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.870
trying to control everything around us

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.150
and forgetting where we've been over

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:39.710
that whole period of time because we've

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.480
been so focused on trying to control it

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.570
or avoid it when in reality the the best

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.120
solution is to confront it develop the

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.630
willingness

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.480
to experience those things to be able to

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.400
understand what's going on inside and

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.360
how it's happened

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.730
so to help you keep connected with the

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.280
things that are important to you yeah

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.190
that's uh that's been hold on my Jackson

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.370
good stop scratching he's like [ __ ] you

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:09.710
you almost yeah I mean I just it just

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.780
makes and I hope this is I do think it's

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.220
translating but it's like it's something

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.200
you sit down and read and it's like it's

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.150
very cuz like alright so I personally

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.450
had a bad taste for I for some reason I

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.070
always had a beef with CDT and I'd learn

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.050
I was always a big psychodynamic young

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.700
and I love that [ __ ] I love weird

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.130
mystical some you know symbolism and I

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.450
still think that stuff's cool and it you

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.700
know it's applicable but I always was

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.530
like CBT so too straightforward and

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.210
robotic and I just I didn't I didn't

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.530
like obviously the Skinner stuff

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.630
behaviorism and like you're looking to

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.750
Skinner he's pretty weird uh did you

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.990
read his novel no no you really utopian

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.280
novel based on like being able to

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.580
control everyone's behavior like yeah so

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.760
Skinner it's a funny thing you know a

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.520
lot of these concepts are based off of

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.220
his radical behaviorism mmhmm yeah

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.980
obviously not Skinner yeah well no but

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.090
here's the thing though it was like that

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.950
was something I had to be like well too

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.150
bad you know just because you don't like

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:06.890
something and then like I started

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.390
reading acted I'm like this just makes

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.040
too much sense and he was even like with

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.410
working with um you know I worked with

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:13.910
high schoolers all last year and it was

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.340
like my I went to Social Work school so

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.990
they're all like psychodynamic every

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.280
which is cool like the whole like

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.010
relational and like you know working on

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.800
like giving people I think they did a

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.330
lot of like object relations which is

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.190
just like building relational exceed

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:29.900
their minds with positive relationships

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.420
and uh that's cool and all but like dude

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.070
this stuff is I think way more

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.680
accessible first of all it's up front

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.850
you like here's what we're doing there's

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.350
not like I'm not gonna sit and talk to

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:40.700
you and like pick apart like well I

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.140
think his mom was like this I think is

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.060
that and then like enter might they say

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.680
like the inner subjective field we're

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.300
now like I'm being pulled into your

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.550
transference it's like sounds [ __ ]

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.040
awesome but it's like it's it's strange

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.600
it's a strange thing to do to somebody

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.700
and then not tell them how it's working

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.920
it's like a magic trick yeah that always

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.540
left a really bad taste in my mouth so I

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.990
did get training in psycho

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.240
dynamic and cognitive behavioral therapy

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.350
and I like CBT to an extent so it's like

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.420
some I'm gonna polish it he's my [ __ ]

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.559
dog is whining he's driving me nuts

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:13.020
you're good hold on one sec we're back

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.640
so I banish Jackson so what were you

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.750
saying you're saying you dislike the

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.210
dynamic and CBD see yeah so you know the

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.090
thing that you know psychodynamic is

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:25.230
something that you know it's I think to

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.940
be honest pre foundational for that

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.830
concept we're talking about for selfish

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.179
context you know being able to

00:20:30.179 --> 00:20:31.860
understand how your environment shaped

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.190
the way perceive yourself in the world

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.450
but you're right it's it's really

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.309
annoying and frustrating because you're

00:20:38.309 --> 00:20:39.300
just kind of having these conversations

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.030
and not really telling and what you're

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.520
doing so to speak and like with even

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.140
cognitive behavioral therapy again like

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.050
it works to an extent but you know some

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.250
of the people that I've worked in with

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:54.540
you know I've taken a big emphasis I'm

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.760
trying to understand the complexity is a

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.010
moral injury like specifically related

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.500
to you know some people that you know

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.690
went through combat experiences like

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.580
veterans and stuff along those lines and

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.920
it just didn't work because you can't

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.390
like try to challenge

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:16.950
would you say it's a challenge or what

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.710
sorry about that the thing my thing I

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.970
don't know what cut out so you're saying

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.270
you can't challenge there you go so I

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.000
thought you're out again I'm a Content

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.310
so you're saying CBT with your veterans

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.770
you can well in some respects so like

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.600
you know you can't like challenge you

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.780
know how they feel about you know doing

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.690
a thing that was objectively bad you

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.380
know and you know there's this really

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.880
great treatment that kind of even helped

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.190
me confirm some transition over to act

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.380
called adaptive disclosure which

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.970
combines imaginal exposure which is

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.130
commonly associated with like exposure

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:00.040
therapy and also like out you know

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.900
having them practice asking for

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.790
forgiveness and developing self

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.640
compassion for themselves throughout

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.280
that process and when I was reading on

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.450
you know how they developed that

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.130
treatment they used a lot of acceptance

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.310
and commitment therapy practices and

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:20.950
I've used I used act and imagine at

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.380
adaptive disclosure with multiple

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.630
patients that I've seen over the past

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.280
couple of years and it's it's actually

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.870
worked really well for for cases that

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.430
would more traditionally be treatment

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.240
resistant yeah I mean again it's one of

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.800
those things that I read and I was just

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.190
like it just makes too much sense so

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:43.390
this thing makes too much sense to me

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.010
it's too much sense it's like it's so

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:46.780
and it's you can actually get that's the

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.130
best thing to you can explain it like I

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.900
went to an internal you do ever hear

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.780
like internal family systems yes so I

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.310
went to a treatment for that I went to a

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.510
treatment I went to it like a training

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.910
for that and it's awesome it sounds cool

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.290
it ties in with a lot of the mindfulness

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.590
stuff too

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.640
like you know they they're like it's

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.500
like imagine yourself as a child and all

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.060
the protective factors and like everyone

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.010
who starts crying immediately you know

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.750
it's pretty it's definitely there's

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.980
something to be said about it but it's

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.750
like again I I've read about it enough

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.310
and I go to explain to someone I'm like

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.260
uh you gotta like you know imagine like

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.580
board members and you're set in your

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.170
head and some people just like what dude

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.440
like no but again it is it is cool I do

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.870
like it but this to me

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.779
for just kind of like easy quick start

00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:31.179
of just kind of small groups is like I

00:23:31.179 --> 00:23:32.620
was like oh this is perfect this is it

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.020
this would be perfect to do yeah and I

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.760
mean it's so easy that they've developed

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.279
a self-help book for it so you know

00:23:39.279 --> 00:23:40.929
people have been able to use this on

00:23:40.929 --> 00:23:42.610
their own in order to make some pretty

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:45.159
significant changes in their life it's

00:23:45.159 --> 00:23:47.200
that book that I told you to get get out

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.000
of your mind and into your life yep

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.390
that's you know the founders Steven

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:53.830
Hayes the one who really pioneered this

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.830
treatment he you know thought it was you

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:00.010
know relatable enough that people could

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.899
go through and practice these concepts

00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:03.340
on their own not even in a treatment

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.470
setting and you know I know this was

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.940
anecdotal they'd never done a study on

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.559
like you know how did their self-help

00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:11.470
book you know work versus CBT or

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.539
something along those lines but a lot of

00:24:13.539 --> 00:24:15.520
really positive things have come out of

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.649
that publishing it in that type of

00:24:17.649 --> 00:24:19.929
format and it gave you know me the idea

00:24:19.929 --> 00:24:22.570
that this could be ultimately translated

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.630
to a peer-to-peer program that's awesome

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.100
yeah and I think like I said if anything

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.659
the peer-to-peer word is amplifies and

00:24:28.659 --> 00:24:31.090
now you're like accountability and it's

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.090
like you have that whatever that thing

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:37.809
is of be like you know how there's a I'm

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:39.070
trying to think how to explain this you

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.049
know so you know doing a PTSD there's

00:24:41.049 --> 00:24:43.630
what's called like not pre verbal but

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.580
like nonverbal like injuries to the

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.590
brain that like verbal talking can't

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.390
help like it just it doesn't activate

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.580
those areas but I think one way to get

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.649
around that is to get to the parts of

00:24:53.649 --> 00:24:55.029
the brain that are affected by trauma or

00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:56.950
usually like the deeper kind of layers

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:59.110
of your brain they might not respond to

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.700
words and all you know people talking

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.200
but just being in a small group and

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.059
being part of something I think kind of

00:25:04.059 --> 00:25:05.409
can like ease when they say like the

00:25:05.409 --> 00:25:07.929
amygdala at large is whatever I think

00:25:07.929 --> 00:25:09.340
like being in a small group is one of

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.010
those really basic things that sounds

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.320
simple but it I think it carries like a

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.120
tremendous it can carry like a

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.450
tremendous uh therapeutic potential yeah

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.309
I mean being in the groups and talking

00:25:21.309 --> 00:25:23.200
about the trauma ultimately is a form of

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.000
exposure therapy even when other people

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.350
are talking because you're watching

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.539
other people get the practice of

00:25:28.539 --> 00:25:30.730
exposing themselves the things that are

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.010
causing them to feel uncomfortable and

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.200
to kind of segue into discussion and

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.909
like how do we do this with that sure

00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:39.460
that we talked about the con

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.289
except of psychological and flexibility

00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:43.480
but ultimately what act tries to teach

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.090
us is psychological flexibility so you

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.789
know the way that we go through you know

00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:50.620
attack that you know attacking

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.480
experiential avoidance is through

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.159
exposure and you can do that through

00:25:54.159 --> 00:25:55.630
mindfulness I mean I'm sure you've done

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.880
mindfulness techniques that you know set

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.620
you up to kind of confront those

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.570
emotional experiences the choice you

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.220
have to stress that's a form of exposure

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.230
therapy you can do it I did which is

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.029
imaginal exposure I definitely wouldn't

00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:10.000
suggest that for this group but you know

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.010
because it's you know probably they

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:13.809
don't tend to do imaginal exposure in

00:26:13.809 --> 00:26:15.340
groups where you know you have them walk

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.590
through the exposure with you over yeah

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.510
I think that'd be a little rough but

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.580
then there's also forms of behavioral

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.520
exposure like a b-bow exposure enact

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.610
what they in vivo exposure means doing

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.850
exposure exercises in everyday life so

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:35.950
for a prolonged exposure for PTSD it's

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.350
you know you develop a fear hierarchy

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.539
based off of you know situations that

00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:42.549
you're actively avoiding and then based

00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:44.770
off that fear hierarchy like whatever

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:46.450
causes you the most distress then you

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.330
try to work them up to exposing

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.179
themselves to like you know going to a

00:26:52.179 --> 00:26:53.860
grocery store or something along those

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.279
lines avoiding with an act and they've

00:26:57.279 --> 00:26:59.230
actually developed this treatment for

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:02.890
veterans with PTSD is instead of doing

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.980
fear based in vivo exposure they do

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.289
values based in vivo exposure so the

00:27:08.289 --> 00:27:09.940
things that you've been avoiding that

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.029
are connected to your values that's the

00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:14.740
type of exposures you can do even on

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.480
your own and that can be ultimately

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.610
reinforced through a group setting

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:20.799
you know what type of things have you

00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:22.899
been avoiding you know and then the next

00:27:22.899 --> 00:27:25.510
session is okay so now that you know we

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.890
had this discussion what things did you

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:28.809
do the past week that you've been

00:27:28.809 --> 00:27:31.600
avoiding but you know we're you know

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.220
important enough to you to want to try

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.320
to get out there and do it again and

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.720
that's a couple of ways that you can do

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.539
you know you can ultimately develop

00:27:40.539 --> 00:27:44.590
openness to combat experience for

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.620
cognitive diffusion there's a ton of

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.929
mindfulness exercise is that to be used

00:27:49.929 --> 00:27:51.789
to help you identify your thoughts and

00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:53.320
the whole go

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.090
goal is to get them to identify their

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:56.950
thoughts that you know this fusion is

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.390
occurring when I have this thought I

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:00.940
feel this emotion and then through going

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.340
through that process the whole goal in a

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.320
group is to you know identify is this

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.260
workable or is this unworkable and to go

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.390
through that process over and over and

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.610
over again until it becomes habit this

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:14.080
is a behavior therapy so would you have

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.510
to replace maladaptive behaviors with

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:18.490
adaptive behaviors and through that

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:20.050
process they're able to make a choice

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:21.610
like okay I'm having this thought it's

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.850
from my past it happened but how is that

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.560
helping me right now stay connected to

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.530
my values and you know that's the the

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.300
first part of it and I'm interested to

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.810
hear your thoughts on that yeah I mean

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:36.460
like I said I think anything that just

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.310
centers somebody into the seat of their

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.140
life rather than you know just kind of

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.430
like when they you ever see it in a rap

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.780
video when people hop out of the car

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.160
like goes walk next to the next to the

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.980
car it's like yeah anything that puts be

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.770
anything that even before that did I

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.290
don't I think the very very there's a

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.720
very small minority of people who have

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.910
actually sat down and be like what do I

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:00.610
value in life what do I you know

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:04.060
whatever my name is personally value in

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.250
life and once you do is like otherwise

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.890
it's just directionless wandering just

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:10.630
being pinged across different cultural

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.550
signals of like like this do this do

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.680
that and you know if being part of that

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.360
is what makes you that's cool do that

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.500
but for a lot of people they start

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.050
feeling like you know like I feel like

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.150
I'm betraying a part of myself that it

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:23.410
you know as time goes on you start

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.060
losing more and more touch with it so

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.410
you just truly don't know who you are

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.320
and it's like that can be really kind of

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.940
horrifying honestly but I feel like

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.320
there's also that part of you that is

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.150
like wait you know when you wake up in

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:35.230
the morning what's the first you know

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.220
what are you thinking as soon as you

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.510
wake up like oh [ __ ] my life I don't

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:38.620
want to wake up I don't want to do this

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.570
you know you hit the snooze button it's

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:41.920
are you tired are you just like I don't

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.690
want to participate in whatever weird

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.430
thing I've set up but you know if it's

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.620
like here's the things I like to do I'm

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.360
gonna prioritize them you know what's

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.300
keeping me like when I wear my first

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.890
marriage I always makes me have to say

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.710
that the I you know I wanted to be a

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.660
comedian I wanted to do I didn't want to

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.300
go work somewhere I just I would do it

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.360
and I was like eh I think I started

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.350
reading this book

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.250
I don't know what it's called but it's

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:08.809
about like forbidden knowledge and

00:30:08.809 --> 00:30:09.770
something something but they there

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.200
there's a term called soul error where

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.730
it's like you're doing something it just

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.470
feels so wrong and you're like I

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:16.910
shouldn't be doing this I can't really

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.000
articulate why you know and then it's

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.130
like if I could somehow sit down and get

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.630
in touch with what I want to do

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:24.830
especially in a group of people like

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.720
well what about this and ask questions I

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.610
don't know man I just think it's it's

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.049
something that people should be getting

00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:31.400
more and more in touch with especially

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.350
since we're not really spending time

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.880
quietly we're not talking to ourselves

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.740
or us being bombarded with visual

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.450
stimuli all day long I think if there's

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.840
the rift between a person's authentic

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.190
relationship with themself is just

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.080
getting larger and larger and larger I

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.120
just I think it's a bad thing sorry I

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.830
was long-winded answer very good I've

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:52.760
had a few of those conversation but you

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.770
know you you know that you made a great

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.659
point our whole society is set up to

00:30:56.659 --> 00:30:58.669
keep you in the past or looking towards

00:30:58.669 --> 00:31:01.250
the future it's just the way it is and

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.320
so the big key to this and I think that

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.850
you can help facilitate this well

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.789
because you have experience with it is

00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:08.900
developing present centered awareness

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.850
that's what keeps this whole thing going

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:12.980
or you know if you're able to be present

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.600
you're better able to have values

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.520
clarity if you're able to be present

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.440
you're able to identify the things that

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.150
you're avoiding if you're present you're

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:21.919
able to identify what thoughts you're

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:23.390
attached to and how they're keeping you

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.669
disconnected from your values I'm where

00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:27.260
this does get complicated is it's all

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.590
connected so you know but a good

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.120
starting spot is to really practice

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.950
these mindfulness principles and

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.020
fortunately there's tons of there's so

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.390
many resources out there on that you

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.520
know in a virtual group setting you

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.220
could Institute and then also there's

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.370
you know application based practice

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:49.070
things that people in the groups can

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.960
look to outside to continue to reinforce

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.520
some of the skills that are being taught

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.100
within session so I think it's

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.500
completely doable in this format and I'd

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.470
like to this is kind of a segue but the

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.299
reason why even most recently I was

00:32:02.299 --> 00:32:04.090
looking more towards the 12-step mile

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:08.929
model is because they compared while I'm

00:32:08.929 --> 00:32:10.850
doing my dissertation I'm doing is an

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.789
alcohol use disorder so like I I'm like

00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:16.850
so into it that I was able to find this

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.220
new meta-analysis that came out

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:23.990
that basically was comparing manualized

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.480
twelve-step versus other interventions

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.080
like CBT for alcohol abstinence and

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.789
across-the-board 12-step if it's

00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:35.240
manualized was better and more effective

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.850
at promoting alcohol abstinence compared

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:41.330
to all other interventions for alcohol

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.780
abstinence so yeah it's so there's the

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.549
proof that peer-to-peer programs work

00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:49.400
and it's been it was like a decade-long

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.549
kind of search and it was consistent and

00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:55.039
oh it was also like non-manual eyes so

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:56.480
like groups that are just set up and

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.580
they do it you know unstructured just as

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.500
effective as other interventions like

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.380
CBT and stuff it's that's wild man and

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.600
it really is I mean it makes sense so

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.010
it's like you know if you have a problem

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.990
in terms of like your emotion your

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:10.970
thinking your feeling it's like would

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.080
you rather get in a small group of

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.490
people who are dealing the same thing or

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.490
just kind of sit in this kind of like

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:18.320
aimlessly talk to an expert with no idea

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.210
what's going on you know it just once a

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.500
week though my god times up and you're

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.140
like what the [ __ ] that's it I just

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.490
leave now it's like what are you talking

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:28.309
about that what happened yeah it's I

00:33:28.309 --> 00:33:30.679
totally agree with you man I do think

00:33:30.679 --> 00:33:32.840
it's a you know the times and I at least

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.840
at least put up a just an option an

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.610
accessible option because it's like you

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:38.780
know it's not working out whatever

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.740
they're doing right now is just not

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.230
working for a lot of people it's it's

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:43.490
there's there there's like this

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:47.390
gatekeeper type of yes there's like okay

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.130
we have these licensing boards and in

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:50.539
order for you to be able to deliver this

00:33:50.539 --> 00:33:51.620
treatment you need to go through these

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.650
licensing this licensing process for

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.150
social workers it takes about four years

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.370
right from start to finish yeah I have

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.350
so I'll be all great I'm pretty much

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:01.970
done now but I'll officially graduate in

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.220
a couple weeks and I'll have my LSW once

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.720
I pass the test and yeah then I think I

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.730
have to get a certain amount of hours I

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:09.050
think it will take actually like two

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:10.520
years so it's two years of school two

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.990
years of practice and after that I think

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:15.080
I'd be able to get my LCSW you might be

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.369
able to like bill insurance and all that

00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:18.649
stuff but it's like I don't want to do

00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:19.760
that I you know I'm doing the podcast

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.379
I'm in a good position where like I

00:34:21.379 --> 00:34:23.000
don't have to and it's like I'd rather

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.339
do something different cuz I ate and it

00:34:25.339 --> 00:34:26.839
is funny it's kind of selfish I just

00:34:26.839 --> 00:34:28.820
hate paperwork yeah I got a taste of

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.050
paperwork when I was at these things

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.700
like no no no I'm not filling out all

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.369
this [ __ ] I have a few

00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:36.589
yeah I mean so like from start to finish

00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:39.980
for my program it's you know six years

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.399
before I okay start seeing people you

00:34:43.399 --> 00:34:45.470
know out you know uh you know on my own

00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:49.220
and it's it's yeah it's just it doesn't

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.750
make sense especially when you see like

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:51.710
some of the people that you're working

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.389
with and that yeah not that not very

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.550
impressive they're kind of stuck in a in

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.619
a pattern that isn't really helping

00:34:57.619 --> 00:35:00.050
people and about these solutions out

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:02.329
there that could easily be delivered by

00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:04.069
the people that are motivated and want

00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:06.530
to help people in like a group type of

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.240
format and I think it's gonna work

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.660
really well yeah sorry to kind of go off

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.260
there cuz oh dude I understand I'm glad

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.970
you did I totally agree it it gives

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.710
people like you know it's like you know

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:19.849
people are kind of thinking like how

00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:21.200
will this work it's like yeah man look

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.849
at look at 12-step programs now like

00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:25.520
take a 12-step type or the guts of a

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.170
12-step program and then apply like

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.420
you're saying like the latest data meta

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.740
research and there's nothing against

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.109
like a a or na but it's like you know

00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:34.400
they're just people kind of coming in

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.809
like you know repeat the steps do this

00:35:35.809 --> 00:35:37.940
and it's like now add like I'm not gonna

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.500
say cutting-edge or whatever but it's

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.210
like add like oh yeah I will say that II

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:43.160
D like a cutting-edge theory or just

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.049
like a something that's constantly being

00:35:45.049 --> 00:35:51.410
read a TEDWomen regular like rigorously

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.180
studied and analyzed and it's like I

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.849
don't see what can go over other than

00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:57.049
the only thing that can really go wrong

00:35:57.049 --> 00:35:59.750
is like whoever is running it just going

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.220
off and doing all kinds of weird [ __ ]

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.780
like it just seems like an incorruptible

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.720
model yeah the only the only thing I'd

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.069
probably be worried about is who's

00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:08.930
delivering it and then also risk you

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:11.750
know because if if if there's anybody

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.329
who's having like any self harm or to

00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:16.220
themselves or others they probably

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.390
wouldn't work well in a peer-to-peer

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.579
program sure you should probably be

00:36:19.579 --> 00:36:21.170
seeing a psychiatrist and or

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.270
psychologist just for risk concerns

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:25.460
because you know there's I don't know if

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.839
there's any legal concerns associated

00:36:26.839 --> 00:36:28.730
with AAA and you know maybe not them

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.740
getting help but that that's the only

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.930
like way I wouldn't see this working

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:34.160
that makes any sense

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.200
ya know that that's the snag of that is

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.970
you know first of all they you know

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.049
especially while we're doing it it's

00:36:39.049 --> 00:36:41.089
just gonna be like hey this is you know

00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:43.730
this isn't this is no substitute for if

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:45.079
you feel like you're in a position where

00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:46.099
like you might hurt yourself this is no

00:36:46.099 --> 00:36:46.520
subs

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.860
please go see actual like you know go

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:51.830
see a psychiatrist psychologist but the

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:53.510
one thing I think will be good is that

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.340
like you know those people are floating

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.260
around there's no way around that and

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.450
it's like say we're doing the group say

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:00.410
you know and this happens in every

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:01.880
single group not every single group it

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.260
happens a lot in a group setting we're

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.330
like someone will just kind of float in

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:07.160
and everyone's like whoa like you know

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.420
everyone's going through pretty you know

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.650
everyone's dealing pretty similar stuff

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:12.020
and someone will be deeply visibly

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:13.790
deeply disturbed and it's like you know

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:15.410
at least there's five people to be like

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:17.930
hey like you should really consider x

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.910
y&z you know come back there's always a

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.800
spot when you come back like go do this

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.900
first you know cuz yeah it's not like a

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.460
silver bullet for everybody but like

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.080
yeah there's people out there who don't

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.240
want to dangle it on a thread so yeah

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.800
that's some that's that that'll take

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.810
some finagling of like you know what

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:34.310
kind of language you know and it's like

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.050
you know and that is a shame you can do

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:37.670
stuff and then someone will just you

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.920
know try to sue or whatever so I'm gonna

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.660
definitely have a lawyer like draw stuff

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.520
up just to keep everyone safe from you

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.740
know that kind of stuff but I would just

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.570
follow the a model they have this pretty

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:50.360
much down at this point because I know

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.860
they're dealing with this constantly

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.770
like especially in na yeah Narcotics

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.260
Anonymous is you know constant back and

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.110
forth between you know self harm and to

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:03.530
themselves to their family and even

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.750
without a they have these issues a lot

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.420
there's PDFs all around that I've looked

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.610
into to kind of see how they do it

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:11.930
and they have a lot of legal language

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:13.940
that I'm sure a lawyer can kind of sift

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.700
through and kind of basically copy it to

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.740
make it work yeah I just don't

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:19.940
understand though it's like so you're

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.620
providing support if you're not

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:22.520
surprising support if you're not

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.690
providing support and you know if

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:25.210
something happens somebody harms himself

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:27.230
whatever but if you're trying to help

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:28.550
them and someone harm himself is are

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:29.990
you're [ __ ] you're gonna sue you and

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.090
it's like what okay like that's crazy

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:33.770
but no I totally I do understand that

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:34.880
though you know especially if someone

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.950
like laps or whatever but I I think

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:39.620
because of you know I went to social

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.030
works well I'm a mandated reporter and

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.560
all that stuff so like I have to you

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.640
know report it and it's just one of

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.810
those things where like I would anyway

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.790
it's the rule it's like someone gonna

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:48.020
kill themselves you have to say it's

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.180
like I would do that anyway it's like

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.470
that's getting too too much in the weeds

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:57.140
of the show but either way no I think

00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.080
that you know taking an a model instead

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:00.410
of

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.329
abstinence you know focusing on

00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:04.369
developing psychological flexibility

00:39:04.369 --> 00:39:06.410
developing openness to your internal

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:09.789
experience to developing mindfulness

00:39:09.789 --> 00:39:12.529
becoming connected with your values if

00:39:12.529 --> 00:39:15.079
that's the goal of treatment and people

00:39:15.079 --> 00:39:16.880
go through some of these things to try

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.619
to help better themselves in those ways

00:39:18.619 --> 00:39:22.309
it's gonna work really really well for

00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:24.769
most people and I you know they've done

00:39:24.769 --> 00:39:28.789
a lot of research in the VA on doing

00:39:28.789 --> 00:39:30.589
groups for act and it's working well

00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:33.589
they're currently in the process of you

00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:35.569
know combining act with other treatments

00:39:35.569 --> 00:39:37.190
because it's working so well like

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:39.259
prolonged exposure I didn't know that

00:39:39.259 --> 00:39:40.640
was going on when I was doing it myself

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.319
so that was kind of interesting to hear

00:39:42.319 --> 00:39:43.609
that some other people are having that

00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:46.609
idea and yeah it's it's something that I

00:39:46.609 --> 00:39:48.500
think if we were to structure it in that

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.450
way and I again I'd be willing to help

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:53.359
in any way I can to kind of figure out

00:39:53.359 --> 00:39:55.480
what would be the most palatable way to

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.069
get this information to people it kind

00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:59.750
of does it itself but you know there's

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.190
always room for improvement on that

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.309
front and you know I'm here to help any

00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:06.049
way I can well I appreciate you man I

00:40:06.049 --> 00:40:07.460
definitely let you know and I do think

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.599
like I said I'm gonna definitely read

00:40:08.599 --> 00:40:10.640
the book I have coming it should be in

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.019
the mail I should be coming in the mail

00:40:12.019 --> 00:40:13.369
any day now so I'm gonna read through

00:40:13.369 --> 00:40:14.930
the whole book listen to my whole audio

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.259
book and then just really come up with a

00:40:17.259 --> 00:40:20.329
group kind of curriculum format kind of

00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:22.160
thing so you know I'll definitely be

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.599
reaching that back out to figure out

00:40:23.599 --> 00:40:26.299
like exactly how to structure the group

00:40:26.299 --> 00:40:27.440
and again I think a lot of it people

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.029
will know it's gonna be at first is

00:40:29.029 --> 00:40:32.089
gonna is experimental so you know well

00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:33.500
it'll be definitely a work in progress

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.940
but I think with that as the framework

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.849
it's gonna be it just for me takes so

00:40:37.849 --> 00:40:39.200
much of the guesswork out because I was

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.700
really like parse to me I was like what

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.230
the [ __ ] am I gonna do like I have an

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.029
idea what I can do but I'm like that is

00:40:44.029 --> 00:40:47.059
like it's just laid out so much simply

00:40:47.059 --> 00:40:48.470
in a way that it's saying it's something

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.059
I believe into like if I was just

00:40:50.059 --> 00:40:51.680
delivering like CBT it's like I feel

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.690
kind of I think CBT is cool it has cool

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:56.210
it teaches people really cool things but

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:58.099
I was like man whatever and I you know

00:40:58.099 --> 00:40:59.720
doing a psychodynamic group would be a

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:03.170
nightmare it'd be crazy yeah those

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.059
groups tend to not work out well anyways

00:41:05.059 --> 00:41:06.799
mm-hmm I wouldn't like there's not

00:41:06.799 --> 00:41:08.509
enough room for everybody's uncaught

00:41:08.509 --> 00:41:11.059
infinite unconscious and it is like okay

00:41:11.059 --> 00:41:14.150
but yeah the yeah that would be at night

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:17.589
but yeah the this is something I think I

00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:19.579
think it'll just work man it just I

00:41:19.579 --> 00:41:21.349
think it lines up with the people I'd be

00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:23.180
dealing with and I stay I think it's

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.650
something people could buy into and

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:27.079
hopefully like I said I ingested before

00:41:27.079 --> 00:41:29.269
we go just a quick quick summary because

00:41:29.269 --> 00:41:30.529
I feel like we laid everything out but

00:41:30.529 --> 00:41:32.420
if you had to summarize it like in a

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.269
nutshell yeah how does you how would you

00:41:35.269 --> 00:41:37.009
summarize you know starting from like an

00:41:37.009 --> 00:41:39.079
example if I'm a young man I'm 23 years

00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:41.690
old I'm having panic attacks I'm going

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:42.859
to school for something I don't really

00:41:42.859 --> 00:41:44.329
care about but you know some of my

00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:47.029
parents want me to do whatever you know

00:41:47.029 --> 00:41:49.339
I my weird relationships with women you

00:41:49.339 --> 00:41:50.569
know whatever it's just like I'm like

00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:54.559
describe myself um well I I guess I've

00:41:54.559 --> 00:41:56.569
worked most worth drama that's like my

00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:59.269
yeah sure so that's just you know I'll

00:41:59.269 --> 00:42:00.980
try to do it pretty quickly so if I were

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.539
to use the model of psychological and

00:42:02.539 --> 00:42:05.569
flexibility if somebody came in with you

00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:07.549
know let's say combat related trauma

00:42:07.549 --> 00:42:10.759
okay you know oftentimes they engage in

00:42:10.759 --> 00:42:12.319
a significant amount of avoidance

00:42:12.319 --> 00:42:14.029
behaviors because the things that

00:42:14.029 --> 00:42:16.819
they've either experienced or done and

00:42:16.819 --> 00:42:18.680
when they're engaging in those employed

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.900
ins behaviors there's closed-off they're

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.999
unaware of how the language or the

00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:25.249
images that they're experiencing are

00:42:25.249 --> 00:42:28.700
impacting them emotionally and through

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.460
that process they try to control all

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:34.759
that avoidance and that keeps them stuck

00:42:34.759 --> 00:42:35.690
in the past

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:37.759
it keeps them you know not focused on

00:42:37.759 --> 00:42:38.930
what they need to be doing in the

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:41.960
present and ultimately is dictated

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.239
because whatever they went through um

00:42:44.239 --> 00:42:46.670
this is the self conceptualization part

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.489
they feel terrible about themselves or

00:42:49.489 --> 00:42:50.720
they feel guilty about what had happened

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.910
and that keeps them stuck in the past

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.259
and when that happens you're

00:42:54.259 --> 00:42:56.359
disconnected from your values like if

00:42:56.359 --> 00:42:57.470
you're married you're not able to

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.119
connect with your wife if you have kids

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:00.319
you're not able to connect with your

00:43:00.319 --> 00:43:02.989
kids you're doing things to try to avoid

00:43:02.989 --> 00:43:06.319
those processes to avoid those memories

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:07.670
and images and thoughts that you're

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:10.660
having so that can include drinking or

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.819
doing things that you know risky

00:43:13.819 --> 00:43:16.579
behaviors or something along those lines

00:43:16.579 --> 00:43:18.470
and you know through the process of act

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.720
instead of going being psychologically

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.180
inflexible what we try to promote is the

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.950
psychological and flexibilities so

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:26.269
instead of avoiding the things that

00:43:26.269 --> 00:43:28.130
you've been trying to avoid we

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:29.780
try to have you to confront them we

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.580
developed a willingness to experience

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.650
them and we do that through exposure

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.260
techniques and then instead of having

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.450
this cognitive fusion that's keeping you

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.880
stuck in the past we have you become

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.950
aware of the thoughts that are going on

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.750
and determining whether it workable or

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:47.150
unworkable and that's facilitated

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.370
through mindfulness actually both the

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.950
exposure and the cognitive fusion are

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:56.210
facilitated through mindfulness and you

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:58.340
know a consequence of a positive

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.290
consequence of mindfulness is you're

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:02.900
able to identify why it's happening okay

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.550
so this thing happened in the past and

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:07.310
now I feel like I'm responsible or I am

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:08.720
responsible for something that had

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.450
happened I didn't want to happen but

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:13.820
it's it's you know ultimately what's

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.620
leading me to have these these behaviors

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.930
and then through that process you can

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:22.490
work with them to develop a process to

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:24.710
let go of that conceptualization and

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:27.050
make a decision to be present and once

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.390
you're present and you're accepting of

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.250
those emotional experiences that you've

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.920
had that gives you the opportunity to be

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.170
connected with your values through being

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:37.820
present you're able to identify what's

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:40.490
important to you and then once you know

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:42.230
what's important to you it becomes a lot

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:44.750
easier for you to do behaviors that are

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:47.000
in line with your values and that's a

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.040
nap shot it's kind it's kind of long

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.080
explanation but I think it covered

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.490
things pretty no I think you covered it

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:53.660
really well it's like you know you're

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.370
you you could be say you're stuck in the

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:57.350
past worried about the future you can

00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:59.180
you accept the fact that those things

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:01.460
happen or those things might happen then

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.900
you allow yourself to just be more

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.670
connected being accepting those things

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:05.900
might happen without trying to control

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.160
everything around you to ensure they

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.720
don't or like you try to correct them or

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.720
whatever you just accept they might and

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.820
then try to maintain yourself in the

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.690
present moment doing B or inline with

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:19.100
behaviors that are in line with your

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.380
actual values your acting out how what

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.760
you actually value rather than trying to

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.860
control imaginary things that have

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.500
happened or might so yeah makes it's

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.600
awesome yeah and you know one of the

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.790
things I wanted to touch on before we

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:34.010
ended was you know you talked a lot

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:36.590
about I mean I've never done any

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:38.360
psychedelics I've never really even

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:42.020
smoked weed but you know I am very into

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:43.340
researching some of these frontline

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.980
treatments for psychedelic assisted

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:48.890
psychotherapy because I see too many

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:50.690
people suffering and the results that

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:53.120
are coming out of the MDA MDMA trials

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.540
for PTSD are magnificent mm-hmm and you

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.010
know the reason why their

00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:59.540
conceptualizing why these things are

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.300
working is because you know especially

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.580
people within the act community like

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:05.960
Steven Hayes the guy who developed the

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.240
treatment surprise surprise you know

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.980
some of the things that got him in line

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.660
with psychological flexibility or

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:16.930
psychedelics yeah I mean dude it's like

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.820
it's there there's something that should

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.560
be you know the whole like happy hour

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.600
culture around them is unfortunate like

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.590
they're like they're linked in to

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:26.720
drinking where it's like my friend had

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.330
ten hits of acid it's like don't do that

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:30.770
like I know a ton of kids who've done

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:32.720
tons of acid and you know it's like I

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.280
don't think gas is inherently like a

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.680
harmful thing but it's like if you're 19

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.050
years old eating five hits of acid every

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:40.910
other weekend you're gonna something's

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:42.500
gonna happen you know you maybe you'll

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.270
become Steve Jobs probably not you'll

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:47.050
most likely be sweeping the you know

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:50.170
parking lot of Best Buy but I feel like

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:53.030
in turn like yeah they makin me you talk

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:54.650
about psychological flexibility it's

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:57.280
like they're you're gonna make yourself

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.720
very psychologically flexible to the

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.440
point where it can be almost

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.300
disconcerting but then you know to be

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.820
able to sit with that and say you you

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:07.400
know again this is an experience I'm

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.350
experiencing something I'm totally fine

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.360
let me let my mind wander and you know

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.970
you really especially with I'm more into

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:15.020
the cannabis I never really mess with

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:17.170
MDMA but like that is something that

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:19.850
really makes you confront your thought

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:21.980
process he's in real time if you really

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.150
are quiet yourself and like we'll pay

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:24.230
attention what's going on

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:26.480
you can I you know I do a thing with a

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.770
deep dive where it's like you know I'll

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:29.960
ingest like an edible clay on my couch

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.490
close my eyes put on meditative music

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:34.550
and it's just like I can interact with

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:36.650
like my deepest level of fear and be

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:38.210
like what am I afraid oh that's what I'm

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:38.690
afraid of

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:39.680
oh and you know you can kind of almost

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.150
operate outside of it you know then it

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:43.010
wears off and you're like oh well I

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:44.180
didn't know I'm so terrified of that

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:45.950
thing or like it's crazy so yeah there's

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:47.000
something to be said for that but it's

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.470
definitely a proceed with caution oh

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:50.810
yeah I wouldn't suggested people to do

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:53.630
it on their own for sure if it's for

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:55.430
therapy purposes for sure

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:57.470
there's plenty it's gonna I mean I think

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:01.160
it's MDMA psilocybin ketamine have all

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.900
been breakthrough status for four

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.849
treatments and there's clinics popping

00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:08.240
up everywhere but yeah it's it it's it's

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.540
just something that I guess what I'm

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.920
trying to hint at is this is ancient

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.410
wisdom this isn't something that is has

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:17.440
been

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.420
it's this isn't something that we're

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.370
coming up with now it's something that

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:26.030
we've known all along and this you know

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:28.400
what we ultimately evolved therapy to in

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.770
the future it may not be this but it

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:32.330
sure as hell is gonna come from this if

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:33.530
that makes any sense

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:36.800
yeah because this is something that has

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.240
been passed down for a long period of

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.700
time a lot of its from you know Buddhism

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:44.240
and Hinduism the concepts that act is

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.540
grounded in but yeah it's it's just a

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:51.110
really cool treatment and I think I'm

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:53.600
excited to help set it up in this type

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.070
of program because I think it can work

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:58.640
appreciate him and I again I I'm super

00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.780
lucky that you reached out because

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.980
otherwise I'd have been scrambling

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.810
around up to my you know usual weird

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:04.250
tricks so like you reached out and was

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:05.870
just like it's weird how you put stuff

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:07.040
out and then it's just like you know

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.570
things fall into place you know well

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:11.750

about those things for a little bit and

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:27.800

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.420
