00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.759
there well you know uh

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.220
Halle Halle hair unit's dude Halle Berry

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.470
tried playing a role where she was going

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.020
to play like a trans woman to man

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.490
disgusting and what do you mean

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.780
disgusting that's disgusting she would

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.640
take a role from someone who is actually

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.860
transact Lee so it actually or modes of

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.409
podcast conclusion huh what modes a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.450
podcast of inclusion well dude I'm

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.219
telling you she was like I'm so happy to

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.450
like learn about this this would be my

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.610
new journey blah blah blah and they were

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.979
like excute how dare you how dick she

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.299
was like this is a story of a woman

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.429
transitioning to a manic no story of a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.110
man

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.930
how dare you Halle Berry true I think

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.870
she actually was right hey if a man

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.880
should be separated by two roles then

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.670
should be like unless somebody actually

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.040
transitions during filming that's what

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.540
I'm saying is if if it starts out with a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.080
woman

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.990
actor the actress should be a woman well

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.990
I think it's strictly just about the

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.910
trans no I understand but either way

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.260
you're being you're playing somebody

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.600
else sure it's not like of Halle Berry

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.760
Halle jeopardy if Halle started it she

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.650
was right in the beginning of the movie

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.990
she would be the correct role yeah you

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.210
know what I mean yeah but I wonder if I

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.800
think the script I think the script

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.070
strictly is when the girl the baby oh

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.990
it's just the things the bro the whole

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.970
script is just a bro yeah I think yeah I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.010
think it's select warrior it's like way

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.720
of the honest warrior and he's like the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.990
bro well then yes they should definitely

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.300
have a man play that nobody at rands man

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.040
which is no difference but there is

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.050
absolutely no even thinking about this

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.070
yeah usually this will be such a sick

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.360
journey they're like how [ __ ] dare

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.770
you and there's another actress who was

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.090
going to do it and then she's like

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.260
alright I won't do it and then the film

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.270
just never gets made because like what

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.760
what like what like million dollar

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.530

yeah well that's the new cuz they got

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.710
called out really for not talking about

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.120
that kind of stuff I never do it was

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.299
like I swear I think there's 160 people

00:17:58.299 --> 00:18:01.600
bid yeah he's a hundred I know I know I

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.520
know a lot of people like to [ __ ] on

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.170
Rapoport I understand

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.630
I was once there too Michael Rapaport

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.870
just but he's he went hard on the black

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.179
on black violence this week finally he

00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:15.580
jumped in yeah well here's here's the

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.130
thing he's a weirdo now he rules

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.600
Trevor why'd you ever watch a typical

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.480
yes with a sideshow great act I love

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.070
that I was a great actor you want me

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.380
over on that I love you too first off

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:31.059
let me tell you he's cool I get it

00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:33.160
leaves a bad taste look I get it I was

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.929
again I was moments away from tweeting

00:18:34.929 --> 00:18:38.710
at it like [ __ ] up he's like dick stain

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.080
Donald you [ __ ] [ __ ] sons at the

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.120
present he comes to my president okay

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.760
here you're saying yeah but anyone comes

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.440
at Trump that weird or any of that [ __ ]

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.940
they're on my radar

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.220
yeah well that that was that's fair and

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.540
it's a fair assumption because normally

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.679
when people are doing that it's like all

00:18:53.679 --> 00:18:55.450
you're just a [ __ ] [ __ ] well you're

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.100
just on there like you [ __ ] orange

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.320
your [ __ ] small dick [ __ ] but he's

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.150
actually he's actually very funny a nice

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.270
guy so I think he just genuinely hates

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.020
Trump probably is I think he just

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.460
actually hates him he's not doing it for

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.520
Klout well there's the thing is now now

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.840
they'll bring it up before get I get

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.470
crushed for defending rap I don't know

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:21.790
anyone happy for the guys like a million

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.500
movies I don't know why I'd have a

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.470
problem he never ever really like no rap

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:27.910
board talks a lot of [ __ ] on social

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.980
media how is he almost exclusively at

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.480
Trump yeah activity tweeting the

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.760
president feeling I was on friends a

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.580
night that's like hey hey how dare you

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.080
dude how dare you how dare you besmirch

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.990
deep blue sea true my bad one of the

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.730
goats that's why I think your people who

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.260
comment on Kylie Jenner [ __ ] on

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.059
Instagram say what the [ __ ] is the point

00:19:49.059 --> 00:19:49.390
of that

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:50.679
well because it makes you feel important

00:19:50.679 --> 00:19:51.100
you get

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.620
you feel like you're talking to Kylie

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.940

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.160

with him he just true he plays a cop he

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:08.650
plays like a simple New York cop and

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.059
everything usually is now he's an

00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:11.799
ambulance driver and a typical yeah he

00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:13.809
was in Louie he was he was good a little

00:20:13.809 --> 00:20:16.780
Moe come on he was good come on yeah man

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.780
he well that's I look everybody's

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.160
entitled to their own opinions but I'm

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.570
telling you the guys actually cool 16

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.600
Donald gets a dick stain Donald Trump

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:33.130
you [ __ ] dog you call from my agent

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.210
that was like do you want to open a

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.010
rapport I was like delete that tweet

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:40.750
yeah I think he's a man no doubt yes but

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.659
that's the well that was the I was

00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:45.429
reading articles about this and now

00:20:45.429 --> 00:20:47.049
instead of like not kind of like talking

00:20:47.049 --> 00:20:49.000
about it they're bringing it up and

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.260
they're like well this is clearly a

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:55.350
result of systemic racism what what is

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.970
they were doing it there was the article

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.289
so it is yeah well you know it's one of

00:21:02.289 --> 00:21:03.429
those where do you want it like I said

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:05.140
but like where do you want to stop where

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.940
do you want to end the search yeah like

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.640
are you like is it just systemic mm-hmm

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.809
what do you wanna go further and be like

00:21:10.809 --> 00:21:14.169
is there accountability that's it is

00:21:14.169 --> 00:21:16.000
there like you just keep yeah well in

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.409
each side we'll stop where they want to

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:20.020
stop mm-hmm exactly that well that was

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.400
the problem so it was like they were

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.200
talking about that and the one guy did

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.669
mention like look like some of this [ __ ]

00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:27.520
is personal accountability but I'm like

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.870
watching this I'm like all this is just

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.030
people it's like dude it

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.860
how would you if some dudes out there

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.690
just like you know shooting happy just

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.070
literally like if you were taught if you

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:37.600
like if I was leaving this Shane I was

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.950
like I'm not to go shoot this

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.350
[ __ ] yeah how would you get

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.039
through to me

00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:43.750
you're just a guy writing an article or

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.039
not well here's what I think about it

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.000
it's like all right how would I get

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.409
through regardless you got these guys

00:21:47.409 --> 00:21:49.299
who were just like yeah I'm gonna shoot

00:21:49.299 --> 00:21:51.549
this [ __ ] dude it's like what the

00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:56.110
[ __ ] dude it was a burp we had a burrito

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:57.850
you know it's like I don't think people

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.049
are given with the reality of a

00:21:59.049 --> 00:22:00.250
situation any people could say oh it's

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.090
from this is from NASA

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:02.770
yeah whatever cool what's funny is when

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.480
rappers try to come out with like

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.399
stop the violence aw it's like they suck

00:22:09.399 --> 00:22:11.950
now we had to watch a video in school it

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.480
was the get it was game or the game

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.200
whatever his name is and he can't really

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.149
know he was he was a he had one of those

00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:21.399
videos where it's like basically like

00:22:21.399 --> 00:22:22.720
it's so hard to be me but the whole

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.309
video was just like people getting shot

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:25.869
and being in a gang and all this stuff

00:22:25.869 --> 00:22:27.429
and like our teacher was like what do

00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:29.649
you think about this I was like just a

00:22:29.649 --> 00:22:31.779
guy glorifying gang murder like what are

00:22:31.779 --> 00:22:33.009
you what yeah well you just don't

00:22:33.009 --> 00:22:35.320
understand it I don't know man it's kind

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.299
of kind of it's kind of bizarre if true

00:22:37.299 --> 00:22:39.759
if the if like they were like say there

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:41.529
were like country stars who like

00:22:41.529 --> 00:22:44.499
espoused like trunk violence yeah that

00:22:44.499 --> 00:22:46.539
are resulting in like any deaths ever

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:48.309
sure it would be something that was like

00:22:48.309 --> 00:22:49.990
dude [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.759
yeah we're just yet you know I mean

00:22:51.759 --> 00:22:54.009
people will try to get like podcasts for

00:22:54.009 --> 00:22:57.639
like we incite negative comments yeah

00:22:57.639 --> 00:22:59.919
internet forums and they're like defund

00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:02.950
them get rid of them that's what

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.509
happened the chop literally just started

00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:06.639
their own [ __ ] and they just get kicked

00:23:06.639 --> 00:23:09.700
out dude they had to Shakur black people

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.889
got shot and killed at the job that was

00:23:11.889 --> 00:23:13.720
her only thing well that was white

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.429
supremacist dude but I'm saying that was

00:23:15.429 --> 00:23:17.379
all they had to do in a little tiny

00:23:17.379 --> 00:23:18.639
Square and they couldn't figure it the

00:23:18.639 --> 00:23:20.950
[ __ ] out and the same people are telling

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.019
the country to chill with that so dude

00:23:23.019 --> 00:23:26.549
you guys couldn't figure it out in a few

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.409
things like a Venus flytrap you're

00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:31.210
unarmed black teens dude they go to that

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.509
you've got body dude true I want I swear

00:23:34.509 --> 00:23:36.429
I still think that could have been agent

00:23:36.429 --> 00:23:38.799
provocateurs it's like then the

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:40.299
billionaires who are like you know

00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:41.919
they're stoking [ __ ] everybody up and

00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:43.419
they see like a bunch of people that

00:23:43.419 --> 00:23:45.070
they've been riling up take over police

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.259
precinct they're probably like let's

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:48.700

00:23:52.299 --> 00:23:53.860
swerving in a car and all that yeah a

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.269
fourteen-year-old yeah

head you're just forced to deal with

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.290
this whole turn it reality and then

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.120

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.350
what all this stuff everything that's

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.090
like a huge hot-button issue right now

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.960
is like point zero zero percent like 1%

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.570
of what's going on like in homicides

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.240
yeah like it's certain like all like all

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.070
the rights and show that's like dude

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.780
this is such a small percentage of [ __ ]

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.760
that's going on yeah this is all just a

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.110
distraction especially when you come

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:07.299
through like a you know 160 people shot

00:25:07.299 --> 00:25:08.380
and killed in a weekend and we're like

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.059
three of them were like you know the

00:25:10.059 --> 00:25:12.070
problem is you get people who go are

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.710
like all right scores even it's like

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:16.330
[ __ ] you guys yeah we don't want to hear

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.740
this [ __ ] it's real that's the response

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.150
people do they're just like what about

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:20.679
all these and it's like that's [ __ ] up

00:25:20.679 --> 00:25:22.179
too but they're talking about Chicago

00:25:22.179 --> 00:25:24.100
and Chicago is literally people try to

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.480
argue about this on patreon but it's

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.330
like it's segregated the actual south

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:29.770
side of Chicago if you go to like the

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:30.910
south side and ask people where the

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.220
south side actually starts it's 99

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.510
percent black damn

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.880
so like Chicago is like physically

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.320
segregated Nick Cannon drinks two

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.429

00:25:39.429 --> 00:25:50.740

it from us kissing we don't participate

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:57.660
from us kissing that that's that's the

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.190
that's there's people who are like like

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.470
you'll never address this issue through

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.990
tabloids and blocks of being like well

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.059
this is cut this comes from it's like

00:26:10.059 --> 00:26:11.440

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.700
everything is happening now compared to

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.890
just like like to all the Mike Brown

that's the one of the six billionaires

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.140
it's pretty credible it's not even just

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.100
that there are publicly traded

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.540

publicly traded corporation there's

00:27:17.919 --> 00:27:21.190
nothing a foreign company owned by a

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:22.660
foreign entity or like owned by a

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.130
foreign government really can buy share

about how my dad literally only gives my

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:41.950
dad will go out and buy meat he buy

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.520

these grocery stores it's why cuz he

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.550
doesn't give a [ __ ] he does he thinks

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.570
expired for he thinks it's made up

00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:00.340
they'll just munch that's any punches

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.750
that's pretty fun but then that was like

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.390
he basically orders from the Joe exotic

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.940

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.940

one's actually that's basically Phil but

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.350

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:24.560
stock of dog girls yeah I say hate each

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.740

definitely won't pack up that's for sure

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:33.020
trade good although I think the real dog

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.500
girl could be she's a bit of an alpha

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.290
sure she's a purebred she is a purebred

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:42.350
up there yeah I didn't think so either

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:45.350
boyfriend though maybe she does
