Description: Santino sits down with Shane Gillis to chat about his Chevy Cruze, our good friend the TURD Chris O'Connor, his dad's balls, getting hit in church and how Shane ominously predicted the death of a famous running back and east coast hip hop.

it's like the new best way to do that

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.040
[ __ ] yeah well i don't genuinely i truly

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.160

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.800
do you mean you could have you don't you

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.920
think you could have tried to go

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.080
somewhere and sell it or no no i think

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.280
after

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.680
after i got canceled what happened

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.280
this whole thing a guy who has no idea

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.000
yeah

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.519
really yeah

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.760
uh but let's be let's be real

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.760
did you really get canceled

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.920
i mean i got it canceled as much as

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.840
people get canceled for the most part

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.519
for saying things now people sometimes

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.840
get canceled for like doing [ __ ] sexual

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.080

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.920

it with rogan

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.560
but like the the the details of how

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.239
you know the context was so t it was so

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.840
taken out of context it was so weird to

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.319
me yeah it was that happens by the way

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.159

[ __ ]

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.959

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.360
confidence of being like don't worry i'm

okani when we talked about it to talk to

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.519
you about it

because i was like oh he definitely

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.319
would because he's interested in finding

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.000
out the real story versus just someone

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.680
being like yeah of course this is what

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.640
it is but anyway all that [ __ ] aside who

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.959
cares but yeah after that i that was the

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.079
only option

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.600
i had do you think you couldn't have

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.359
gone somewhere like hbo or amazon no i

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.040

i can

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.000
because of the success hopefully this

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.560
one does well enough yeah that i can

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.639

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.560
everywhere

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.400
how many people fit in there uh it's

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.199

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:39.919
anything illegal and it was like all

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.000
right right that's everybody in texas

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.600

illegal about this it's like all right

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.479
but everyone's just kind of asking you

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.000
not to do it that is funny because

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.360
that's so true everything there is just

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.120
like on the border of

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.360
yeah it's not cool but it's not yes the

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.880
law you can't you can't tell me what to

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.479
do you can get bummed about it yeah

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:57.680
you're not gonna put me in prison and i

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.759
was i was bummed i was [ __ ] bummed

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:02.000
dude i was on stage just like [ __ ] yeah

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
90 90 is kind of what i keep playing i

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.440
think that's why rock did his special

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.280
where he did that one where it was

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.720
yeah it was kind of four shows or

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.560
whatever whatever it was cut it together

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.759
but yours was better than chris rocks

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.800
you heard it here first i said it

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.479
thanks bro no it was really really good

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:18.240
man i'm you should be so i texted you

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.759
today and i said how happy you should be

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.840
about it i knew you would be but it was

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.960
also

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.960
look i have a genuine question just

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.960
outside of being a friend as like an

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.280
observer or a fan i was like

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.039
oh this was really strategic maybe it

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:32.560
wasn't on purpose but like putting out

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.319
the gillian key sketches on the channel

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.759
and growing yeah

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:36.800
did you want to do that the whole time

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.840
were you like i'm gonna grow this with

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.280
the sketches i'm gonna do and then drop

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.199
a special the plan was to do that yeah

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.720
yeah okay that's smart because i saw it

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.240
i was like that's really smart yeah the

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.160
plan was to film a bunch of sketches and

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.319
then in this lull where we we're

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:49.440
hopefully going to make some more

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.680
sketches but we'll see what happens in

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.599
between the first couple sketches and

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:55.360
hopefully next season

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.520
put a special yeah it was good so we'll

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.199
see hopefully that happens are you one

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:00.160
of these guys that's going to try to do

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.080
a special now every year no

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.840
no that took like [ __ ]

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.680
two years

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.000
it took 36 years yeah that's still all

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.520
my material i'm gonna go do that

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.960
material tonight i like that you're

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.160
honest about this yeah i hate when

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.599
people are like nah man you know when

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:14.960
you hear like and it's also it's always

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.800
like a bad comic that's like i've got

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.080
like a whole new hour and you're like

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.919
you're what how you're all your other

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:21.199
[ __ ] that's bad i think that's kind of

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:22.879
why you got to be confident enough to be

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:24.720
like this is good

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.560
every time yeah yeah yeah i mean i mean

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.240
obviously there's guys like louie and

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.680
all those dudes

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.879
uh he got canceled

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.039
he's uh but

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.519
like the guys who put out an hour

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:39.599
that was crazy he was doing that

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:41.200
why it looked it was good here's the

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.800
problem

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.800
when jordan had that game where he could

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.959
hit all those threes yeah

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.320
it gives the impression sometimes that

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.920
other nba players could also do that

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.279
yeah and then they try and you're like

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:53.200
hey you can't do that yeah you can't

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.560
that was the thing it's like louie set

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.279
an unfair standard and now you saw other

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:59.360
comics not gonna mention who but like we

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.640
saw people putting out too many specials

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.839
and you're like

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:03.519
across the board yeah even comics that i

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:04.959
like i was like what is that dude yeah

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:06.720
you're putting out too much [ __ ]

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.240
like i don't think anybody even if it's

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.519
a really good special i don't think

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:11.839
everybody wants to see

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:13.760
that much stuff from

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.000
all of the comics sure a very selected

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.080
blessed by the comedy god few but like

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.200
yeah like when louis put out [ __ ] all

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.959
the time i was like this [ __ ] i

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:22.080
felt like he could do it every six

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.720
months yeah he could it was shocking

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.480
yeah it's just how he yeah he's just

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.839
funny he's just the best no matter what

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:29.200
yeah yeah he's the best unfortunately

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.560
he's the best like there's no other way

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.920
to say it of like yeah yeah yeah what is

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.279
the magic it's like he just has the

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:35.920
thing the best ever but um and and it's

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.600
cool that you left in uh how many people

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.800

somewhat i've had good liquor no no this

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.320

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.240
articulates he's very smart yeah but

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.600
then he'll do stuff where you're just

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.920
like dude what the [ __ ] dumbest [ __ ]

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.399
i've ever seen yeah yeah by far so he's

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:16.320
fighting with these dudes about sand

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.920

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.959
middle of it the one of the dudes is

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:28.959
like they're talking about sand and

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:31.360
compacting sand for five hours and if

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.920
water is poured on sand it becomes

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.600
uh dense or something something like

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.480
that chris oh man he's gonna hate this

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.160
dude

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.079

to therapy and i got to tell you this is

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.200
uh a great way to speak with somebody

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.960
it's not a crisis line it's not

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.320

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.480

office building somewhere

i think most people agree it's a bummer

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.720
and this is also cheaper than

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.360
traditional offline counseling

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.440

truly explaining [ __ ]

00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:12.799
something to a dog at this point like my

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:13.840
dad can't

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.600
change the channel on a television and

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.279
i'm supposed to explain what a podcast

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:19.440
is how doing a youtube special would

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.480
help me

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.720
things like that yeah like because it

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.080
started when you start staying up it's

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.919
always like how much are they paying you

00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:27.600
that's what my dad would always ask the

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.760
money like i'd be like oh i got a spot

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.559
at

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:32.480
helium comedy club i got a guest spot

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.520
it'd be like how much are they paying

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.960
you it's like nothing

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.159
he's like well what the [ __ ] are you

00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:37.679
doing that for like

00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:39.919
this is good this is the thing yeah yeah

00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:41.440
that is a hard thing to explain i think

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.360
when you start

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.200
when you start um

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.360
getting in the groove of doing shows and

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.799
you're still not getting money when

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:49.840
you're young

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.440
at all in fact you're still only getting

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.279
money for a long [ __ ] time sure and

00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:55.200
then

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.960
when people ask you because that's a

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.559
very for some reason asking about money

00:27:58.559 --> 00:27:59.760
you would never go up to a guy who's in

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.440
sales and be like how much you make yeah

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.760
ever but because of us they're like how

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.440
much they pay you for the shows and my

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.200
family has no problem asking you yeah

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.559
and i'm like what the [ __ ] you can't i

00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:10.880

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:54.000
what do dads do in the midwest that

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.080
stuff yeah so imagine when like your

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.240
son's like i want to be i'm doing an

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.559
open mic

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:02.640
were they yeah but was your what they

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.159
knew you were going to be talented they

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:05.360
knew your talent was going to be

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.200
cultivated so when you told them that

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.200
this no really

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.559
not i have a hard time believing that

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:13.679
someone like you the way you are that

00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:15.440
they didn't think uh he's gonna have

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.679
talent yeah well that was cause i failed

00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:20.480
early i went to west point for football

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.840
yeah and they were like oh there it is

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.600
he's gonna be like a senator

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.679
and then i cried and quit after like two

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:27.840
days

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.919
and they're like nope he's a [ __ ] yeah

00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:33.039
so yeah but he's a smart [ __ ]

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:34.799
maybe you're smart with your own brain

00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:36.080
if you won't give yourself scholastic

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.200
credit you at least have to give

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.960
yourself street credit yeah the way your

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.640
brain works is is different and

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.880
wonderful so obviously i just don't buy

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.080
it i'm not used to these compliments

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.080
dude well yeah well you're usually

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.440
talking to me

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.600
sorry i should i'll tone it down yeah no

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.960
but you know what it is i think that i

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.559
just don't buy that someone as skilled

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:55.279
as you with talent that you have

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:56.559
i don't buy that your parents didn't

00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:58.080
know when you were like i'm gonna do

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.279
this that they were like

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:00.960
yeah i bet he's gonna be good

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.840
maybe

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.360
maybe football they were like he might

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.760
be good he might [ __ ] not yeah true

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.679
but like i think every any comic friend

00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:09.360
i have that is good that's like

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.760
naturally good and also just has worked

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.120
hard to build

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.799
i think most of our families kind of

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:15.919
knew it was like no this is definitely

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:17.600
what they're going to do something yeah

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.039
whatever they can't put the thumb on it

00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:20.880
we could we didn't either until you

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.480
started to figure it the [ __ ] out but

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.000
that oh that's the other thing about

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.559
money i don't want to skip over but

00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:28.720
you on the on the youtube the number one

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.240
thing that like my parents actually

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.520
asked me about because i was just home

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.640
in chicago

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.880
i spoke about you and then i said yeah a

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.559
buddy of mine's putting out a special on

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:38.240
youtube and my mother was like are you

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.440
said maybe i don't really know i haven't

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.120
decided about that [ __ ]

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.480
and she's like you should do the youtube

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.159
thing can you make money on it and i was

00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:48.320
like well you can but it's also to yeah

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.960
not really yeah right because like you

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.039
didn't put monetization on the video

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:54.240
yeah and i thought about that i was like

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.480
i i wonder what's the rules

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.000
like what would you did you do it

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.440
consciously or are you doing yeah i did

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.279
yes you can you could i didn't even add

00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:02.720
like a tipping

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.840
option why didn't you do that

00:31:06.399 --> 00:31:07.760
should we do that now

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.200
should we go back and do that no it's

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.799
just uh

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:12.399
the tipping thing i think i don't know

00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:13.679
how much money i would have made i think

00:31:13.679 --> 00:31:15.039
maybe

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:17.279
did ten five ten thousand dollars you

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:18.480
say that dude it's a bummer because

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.919
you'll never it could have been so much

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:22.640
who knows i know

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
[ __ ] watching you think about it is

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.960
great

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.320
dude

one dollar we set it at one dollar when

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.559
we started it yeah and now we won't

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.080
change it and we were like early on we

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.399
were like never doing ads ever now

00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:39.519

that nine heads a week yeah yeah we're

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.880
gonna have to start doing that because

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.360
there's a delicate line between you have

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.880
to want to we want to do our art and do

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.559
whatever the [ __ ] we want but also

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:50.000
you're like well this is our career i

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.200
think there's a mistake when someone's

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.799
like are you selling out you're like you

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:54.159
mean i'm trying to pay rent what the

00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:55.760
[ __ ] are you talking about yeah like

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.320
like you worked so [ __ ] hard to put

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.080
that special together to do all the

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.840
puzzle pieces that no one thinks about

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.960
[ __ ] not just cultivating the

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.880
material yeah running it practicing it

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.320
organizing where it's going to be the

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.320
way you want to look and feel and sound

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.360
how you want it to be presented to

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.559
people

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:11.840
all of that

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.000
and then they get it for free which is

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.600
[ __ ] unreal and i know the fans will

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.120
comment and just be like shouldn't have

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.640
i would have paid

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.039
no i don't care nobody i really i really

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:22.720
don't because this

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.399
putting a special like this on youtube

00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:26.880
is a long-term thing yeah like um i will

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.120
make money off 100 yeah yeah no i think

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.320
you did it the right way is what i'm

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.640
saying is like i think it because i

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.919
thought about it i was like maybe i'll

00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:36.240
just do something like that and i just

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.919
put it out like put out like [ __ ] 20

00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:40.000
minutes put out like a half hour yeah

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.559
just put it on youtube i know i

00:32:42.559 --> 00:32:43.600
they were like do you wanna do an hour

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.799
and i was like let's just edit it and

00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:46.000
see where it's at

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.279
and that'll be the time we don't have to

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:49.279
do a time frame if it's on youtube how

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:51.039
many minutes is it i think it's like 48.

00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:53.039
great yeah yeah i've spoken about this

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:55.200
too duncan trussell and i did we talked

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.600
about this pretty openly about how like

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.600
there's this weird innocuous idea of an

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.799
hour and you're like who made it up

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:02.960
anyway yeah it's not a thing that ever

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.960
it wasn't like you know and hours the

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.080
perfect you're like well we have those

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.679
segmented times because of television

00:33:07.679 --> 00:33:10.640
yeah television 22 and 45 or whatever it

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.320
was true of the blocks of half an hour

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.440
and hours

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.640
that's the only reason we have that in

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.799
our mind yeah so you're like outside of

00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:17.519
that

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:19.600
some shows are better at 45 minutes some

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.960
shows are better at an hour and twenty i

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.919
mean

00:33:21.919 --> 00:33:24.480
how long how long like i i love comedy

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.919
obviously but like

00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:28.240
an hour special is like sometimes

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.559
tedious even if it's the best comedian

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:32.720
yeah in the world i've never finished an

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.480
hour in one sitting yeah yeah i've only

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.320
one time actually

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.200
louie

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.720
i finished louis front to back in one

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.399
second yeah but that was that was also

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:41.840
pre-phones

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.919
okay that's true that's true [ __ ] up

00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:45.440
the hour yeah you're like i can't watch

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.600
i can't watch television no without just

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.720
immediately

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.399
being on the phone yeah sometimes i'm

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:52.240
watching a thing from tv on my [ __ ]

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.320
phone while i'm watching tv yeah like i

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.159
watch sportscenter highlights yeah i'll

00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:58.000
be watching sportscenter on instagram

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.519
while i'm scrolling through [ __ ] on tv

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:01.919
yeah but also

00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:03.679
in a sick way you're like this is better

00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:06.240
consumption of my use of my time because

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.000
i'll just get what i need no in terms of

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.079
like that like small package chunks yeah

00:34:10.079 --> 00:34:12.000
because now i can i watched your special

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.159
in two sittings because like i had time

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:15.359
to chill and do it without while i was

00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:17.040
doing something else and then

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.480
it just kind of worked out that way so

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.960
like i do think

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.240
i think it's going to create a standard

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.159
of being like well just do the the best

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:25.919
chunk you want to do yeah and put it out

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:27.919
and then see what the [ __ ] happens yeah

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:30.399
or even like material i don't know well

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:31.919
that's because you're getting rid of

00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:33.119
something throwing it out and throwing

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:35.280
it away putting ten minutes on yeah i

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.639
know i think i should i mean i should

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:38.639
start to do that more often but it is

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:40.639
hard for me just because you're like i

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:42.800
don't want them to see it yeah i know i

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.639
know it's so funny

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.399
i've never put out anything like this

00:34:46.399 --> 00:34:49.200
material like a special yeah yesterday

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.320
it was hard

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.399
it's like hard it's nerve-wracking i bet

00:34:52.399 --> 00:34:54.879
for like the first two hours i was like

00:34:54.879 --> 00:34:56.960
oh [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] were you so

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.880
and did you make any court like any vow

00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.680
to be like i'm not gonna read the

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.960
comments and any of that i read all the

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.720
comments yeah i read every single

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.400
comment

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.000
i think i don't know why people pretend

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.680
they don't yeah there's this i used to

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.440
fight with rogan about that all the time

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.800
maybe he's like don't read the comments

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.520
i was like really that's why i put it up

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.280
i put it up for the thing otherwise

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.040
these apps would just have

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.359
a like button not a comment section

00:35:19.359 --> 00:35:21.200
they're there and he's some guys are

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.040
probably too big and is it like burr and

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.040
even them i bet you they still do yeah

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.560
they do it's just

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.160
you when you're when you're rich enough

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.760
you have the ability to be like i don't

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.960
read comments

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.040
true or i don't know maybe you get

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.920
because they you do get number number to

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.480
them they start to well you know what's

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.000
really gross but a couple guys hit me

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.920

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.920

yeah they got me on that

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.000

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.160
funny because

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.599
it's oh it's always something you see

00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:02.560
for me

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.400

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.400
maybe is interesting are you going to

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.760
keep doing some of that material anyway

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.960
live

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.400
uh yeah i don't think i have a choice

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.320

me do 10.

00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:55.359
yeah but i mean like i mean i do have

00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:56.720
old stuff and stuff that wasn't in there

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.560
for sure yeah but yeah that's always

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.240
like one of those um

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.480
right now it's i opened the last weekend

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.520
i did i did about 20 new up front

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.760
20 up front yeah that's good yeah and

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.000
i'm happy with this early on yeah

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.119
yeah because i feel like all these guys

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:12.160
like you know like

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.359
mullany

00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:15.760
and all these bigger big names

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.040
they're doing these new tours and

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.560
they're like writing them off as like

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.000
brand new material like here's a show

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.920
from scratch or something like that i

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.079
think that's a great way to be like i'm

00:37:24.079 --> 00:37:25.520
not in love with all this stuff yeah

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.040
yeah yeah i wish i could say that for

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.240
every [ __ ] time i go out i'm like

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.680
dude i'm in love with a lot of this not

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.079
all of it yeah you know because it's so

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:33.680
hard to cultivate so much new stuff in

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.720
between

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.400
whatever else the [ __ ] you got going on

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.839
like with you guys writing gilly and

00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:39.119
keeve stuff

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:41.200
like are you

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.400
is that a thing that you think you're

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.720
just gonna keep doing i'd like to but

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.000
yeah it's not like a one-time thing

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.200
we'll see i don't know i don't know how

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.040
interested people are in buying sketch

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.599
comedy so i mean i think gillian keebs

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:53.040
is more of a

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.760
i think it's a good like real type thing

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.599
to like show what we can do maybe

00:37:57.599 --> 00:37:59.280
because mckeever's writing and directing

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.200
and doing all this [ __ ] yeah and it's

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.119
just a nice way to show everybody like

00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:05.200
we're capable of making things

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.800
maybe you want to get a spot with snl

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.000
you think they'll let you audition with

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.400
it i would try

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.560
i'll give it a shot can you imagine

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.920
if i went back i don't know send it back

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.839
to him lauren's seen all of them yeah no

00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:17.200
of course he has i know yes but you've

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.720
spoken about him being he's a fan of you

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.599
still

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:20.480
yeah

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.640
yeah yeah yeah he's a nice guy yeah he's

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.400
very he's like actually a nice guy no i

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.400
i said it when i tested and he treated

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.920
me so well and i heard these weird

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.359
rumors about him

00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:30.560
and i was like

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.680
i guess i'm

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.599
i guess maybe unless he's really good

00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:34.480
actor

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.839
i know that was one thing i was worried

00:38:35.839 --> 00:38:37.359
about is he really going to actor is he

00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:39.359
like being nice to me so i don't like

00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:40.480
publicly

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.920
what are you going to backlash what

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.359
would it be yeah i don't know you know

00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:44.480
what i mean yeah i know and then sitting

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.480
in his tower yeah he fired me he's not

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.520
worried about

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.880
whether i'm going to spaz yeah

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.160
[Laughter]

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.520
it would have been funny if i did spaz

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.800
the spaz spazzed on it would have been

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.800
funny to spaz when i got fired like put

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.760
out a video like what the [ __ ] like red

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.839
face

00:38:58.839 --> 00:39:01.050
crying you [ __ ] ruined my dreams

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:02.800
[Laughter]

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.599
that is one serious regret is how much

00:39:05.599 --> 00:39:08.560
comedy i [ __ ] missed yeah while all

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.400
the spotlight was on me just how many

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.640
funny things i could have done or said

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.680
but also because i think you were

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.280
struggling we spoke i was in new york

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.640
yeah i landed in new york and we were at

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.920
the bot we were at the stand or

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.880
something mm-hmm and i was like

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.040
i i was like i remember saying to you i

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.359
think people just don't understand

00:39:25.359 --> 00:39:27.440
what's going on it's easy for them to

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.400
just be like

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.839
this guy's a piece of [ __ ] and you're

00:39:29.839 --> 00:39:31.760
like have you talked to him about this

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.359
whole thing yeah or are you just gonna

00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:35.119
throw a dart to the guy sure because

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:36.720
beyond the idea in this day and age that

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.760
you're like

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.760
did you kill someone or like physically

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.560
assault somebody yeah no you said

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.320
something stupid maybe out of a context

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.160
that should be talked about how is there

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.920
no room for that it's very that was what

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.280
bothered me when i talked to you and

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.520
dude i could see it in your face

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.079
you were it was you were shook dude oh

00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:56.240
yeah you were like the first time the

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.079
first time i got i felt an earthquake

00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:00.000
here when i was like

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.240
it was like that idea of like yeah am i

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.599
gonna is this gonna be okay well

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:07.760
i'll be honest the whole time i was like

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.599
i did know i'd be all right like the

00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:12.079
entire time i was like this will be okay

00:40:12.079 --> 00:40:13.520
for sure i knew

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.760
this would be the new path

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.599
yeah and i dude i only had snl for like

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:19.839
one week i had like one week to be out

00:40:19.839 --> 00:40:21.040
of

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.440
the world i knew i was gonna have second

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.599
book snl they're it's like they start

00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:27.440
the races they're like go

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.640
they see how fast they can all of a

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.160
sudden no because the whole time like i

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.599
moved to new york open mics all that

00:40:31.599 --> 00:40:32.720
[ __ ]

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.319
and then it's like i'm just gonna have

00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:36.000
that look i know who i am i'm gonna have

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.319
to grind it out to have a career yeah

00:40:38.319 --> 00:40:39.839
and then like for like two weeks it was

00:40:39.839 --> 00:40:41.839
like i'm gonna be on snl

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:44.079
and then it was just like nope back to

00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:46.480
back to ground podcast and stand up that

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.800
was it i had like i breached the surface

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.560
for one minute but ironically you would

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.760
podcast and a stand-up even if you're

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.760
probably yeah what's it it's not a yeah

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.040
it's like anything else you know when

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.160
you buy something new and you really

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.440
wanted it and then when you have it

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.400
someone's like that's cool and you're

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.200
like

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.000

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.160

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.680
but i'm a car guy so he bought he bought

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.119
the porsche suv which to me i'm like

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:24.640
that's not a porsche it's funny that he

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.640
bought that it's not a hey it's not a

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.800
porsche really you hit him with that he

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.040
everyone who knows cars a porsche suv is

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.319
you just got an suv that was too

00:42:32.319 --> 00:42:33.599
expensive

00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:35.760
just get a jeep yeah

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.440
i say that should we get the rv i'm a

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.119
brad about cars when someone like brags

00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:40.880
about a car it's just not like i'm a

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.280
brat about class but when someone brags

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.720
about a car then i'm like

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.160
so you're really bragging about that

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.440
true it's like when someone buys a

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.040
porsche and they buy the what used to be

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.040
the boxster yeah or the entry level i

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.319
used to like the boxer when i was a

00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:54.000
young man i used to think it was cool

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.079
yeah i guess it's actually a lady trait

00:42:56.079 --> 00:42:57.920
it's it's like a [ __ ] car yeah yeah

00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.839
it's just in general i think my mom used

00:42:59.839 --> 00:43:01.920
to think a mazda miata was cool better

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.520
than a porsche so when i was young i was

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.040
like someday i'm gonna get a miata

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.240
like when i was a young man i was like

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.079
i'm gonna make it one day you'll see me

00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:13.280
cruising around in a mazda miata

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.680
all right so look let's say you do get

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.680
uh unbelievable success like you are

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.200

those guys that's what i'm saying yeah

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.480

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.920
it's one in the same yeah i mean you

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.359

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.319
quinns and those guys from that era yeah

00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:42.240

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.720
watched it dissipate when i was like

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.720
[ __ ] bill burr moved here sure like

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.839
insecure people

00:52:57.839 --> 00:52:59.680
yeah going back and forth but i always

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.520

well you're like the uh yeah it's good

00:58:03.359 --> 00:58:05.200
the kiss of death comes and then the

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.319
and then the redskins announced they

00:58:06.319 --> 00:58:07.920
were going to use a white corner and i

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.119
was talking about how there's no way you

00:58:09.119 --> 00:58:10.400
mean the washington football team

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.920
football team pardon me what do you

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:12.720
think they're going to name that

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.960
eventually i don't know i saw red hogs

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.119
was or something like that was leading

00:58:17.119 --> 00:58:19.119
what red hogs yeah which hopefully they

00:58:19.119 --> 00:58:20.079
do

00:58:20.079 --> 00:58:22.720
i think ironically as a comedian the

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.839
writing

00:58:23.839 --> 00:58:25.359
like the writing and naming of

00:58:25.359 --> 00:58:27.839
washington football team was hilarious

00:58:27.839 --> 00:58:29.599
yeah i was like this is like a clever

00:58:29.599 --> 00:58:30.960
joke like that's like a funny comic

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:32.319
would be like it's a good response fine

00:58:32.319 --> 00:58:34.000
washington football team

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.280
it almost seems like there's such

00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.359
sarcastic retort that you're like

00:58:37.359 --> 00:58:39.119

chiefs of the tribes and gotten approval

00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:35.920
the idea that

those chiefs better be making some bread

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.359

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.640
normal if i went to church and saw a dad

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.240
slapping his son in the back of the head

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.000
out of actual anger

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.119
yeah but do you have your own son at

01:03:25.119 --> 01:03:27.520

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:30.480

you're right

01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:41.280
it's like uh

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.280
uh it's like uh it's a community that's

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.720
what i was brought up in yeah that's how

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.319
you act that's what you do all that but

01:04:46.319 --> 01:04:47.920

do you believe in a god it's a hell of a

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.559
question on a comedy podcast yeah i'll

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.839
say whatever the [ __ ] i want it's my

01:04:57.839 --> 01:04:58.960
show

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.039
the hard-hitting questions yeah what are

01:05:01.039 --> 01:05:02.720
you a columbine shooter i know this is

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.839
different than joe's show yeah joe

01:05:05.839 --> 01:05:08.400
uh do i believe in god i think it

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.119
fluctuates yeah at this moment right now

01:05:11.119 --> 01:05:12.240
no

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.799
okay but maybe tonight

01:05:14.799 --> 01:05:16.319
um when you're on stage

01:05:16.319 --> 01:05:17.359
uh no

01:05:17.359 --> 01:05:19.520
that'd be funny right i was on stage

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.839
like oh my god god is real dude i'm so

01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:23.599
good at this

01:05:23.599 --> 01:05:25.359
that's what it would hit you no it's uh

01:05:25.359 --> 01:05:26.799
yeah sometimes before bed i'll think

01:05:26.799 --> 01:05:27.599
about

01:05:27.599 --> 01:05:29.200
my lord and savior

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.960
do you pray to him sometimes you pray i

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.440
pray sometimes are you [ __ ] around no

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.720
you're [ __ ] around okay i'll

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.480
occasionally for real i don't pray i

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.240
don't pray but occasionally i'll

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.480
instinctively hit in our father before

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.599
bed do you just um just instinctively

01:05:43.599 --> 01:05:45.280
chiseled into your [ __ ] brain into

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.720
this i don't know what it is

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.000
well because i talked about this with

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.039
like another comic people who are very

01:05:51.039 --> 01:05:53.520
very poor have religion and people that

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.400
get very very rich have a similar

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.640
religious thing because what happens is

01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.760
when you're poor you want to believe in

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.599
something and when you're rich sometimes

01:06:01.599 --> 01:06:03.119
when people get so rich they can't

01:06:03.119 --> 01:06:04.880
believe that it's happening in the same

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.400
way that you can't believe yourself that

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.359
you're like

01:06:07.359 --> 01:06:09.039
i gotta find a reason to make sense of

01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:10.400
this true

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.319
i was middle class i was middle class

01:06:12.319 --> 01:06:14.240
right yeah but that's what we were my

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.000
dad was poor

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.640
growing up so he had that yeah and his

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.119
dad died and all these bad things

01:06:21.119 --> 01:06:22.799
right so like he yeah the being very

01:06:22.799 --> 01:06:24.480
poor and being religious is pretty funny

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.319
well it's it's but it's it's really got

01:06:26.319 --> 01:06:28.160
to find meaning to what the [ __ ] keeps

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.240
happening how am i so [ __ ] yeah

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.200
something's got to explain why i'm

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.440
getting worse [ __ ] yeah

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.280
but that's the truth or if you get so

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.960
rich i've seen a hole in our roof

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.599
i gotta go to church it's cold

01:06:41.599 --> 01:06:44.160
our house is cold

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.160
i saw a guy a friend get really really

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.319
rich and he got really really religious

01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:49.440
and i

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.960
and i didn't get it

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.280
and then as i've gotten older with age i

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.240
was like

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.079
i do know what it is he just wanted

01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:58.160
meaning to like his success sure because

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.000
he almost felt like he didn't deserve

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.319
that guilty did he deserve it

01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:03.839
no

01:07:03.839 --> 01:07:05.440
does anybody

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.720
whenever somebody gets well off you're

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.559
like that guy yeah this wasn't that good

01:07:08.559 --> 01:07:09.680
name of the last time when somebody got

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.960
really successful he went totally

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.559
deserved tim

01:07:12.559 --> 01:07:14.799
tim yeah tim i guess

01:07:14.799 --> 01:07:16.960
schultz

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.559
yeah but andrew is

01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:19.760
it's different

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.520
andrew was andrew

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.440
like had the makeup of being successful

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.280
before he was ever successful

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.480
you know kevin hart was like i bought a

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.839
big house before i ever could afford it

01:07:27.839 --> 01:07:29.920
andrew schultz is the exact same way yes

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.200
like you know when they say fake it till

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.720
you make it like andrew made it and then

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.720
he made it yeah i mean he was very good

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.160
at that absolutely tim is probably the

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.760
best one i've ever heard tim's tim's

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.280
very funny yeah i mean

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.799
again last night we're eating dinner

01:07:40.799 --> 01:07:42.799
yeah and like i couldn't believe it the

01:07:42.799 --> 01:07:44.960
the owner of the place was coming over

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.960
until i kissed the ring not to keep but

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.400
yeah basically to come over and be like

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.839
how do you like the meal this is just

01:07:49.839 --> 01:07:51.520
this is off the menu we got it for you

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.640
that's kissing stuff like that i

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.319
couldn't believe it yeah

01:07:54.319 --> 01:07:56.079
i think he moved away from l.a just so

01:07:56.079 --> 01:07:58.319
those things would happen more often

01:07:58.319 --> 01:07:59.359
because if you live here all the time

01:07:59.359 --> 01:08:00.799
they get sick of you probably they see

01:08:00.799 --> 01:08:02.400
you a lot yeah so now that he gets to

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.079
come back and i was crazy the king

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:05.680
returns i couldn't dude i was sitting

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.599
there like holy [ __ ] dude you're famous

01:08:07.599 --> 01:08:09.039
he's like i know it's been crazy like

01:08:09.039 --> 01:08:12.400
he's very yeah i said tim's one yeah tim

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.680
is probably the one where i go oh that

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.760
guy deserved it i'm glad he did yeah

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.199
but but most of the time when anybody

01:08:17.199 --> 01:08:18.719
gets successful you're like oh [ __ ] them

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:20.640
yeah [ __ ]

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.839
they're on what show

01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:25.920
[ __ ] would you ever do tv [ __ ]

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:26.719
yeah

01:08:26.719 --> 01:08:28.319
not i'm not making a reference joke

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:30.400
about s no i know you're not scripted

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:33.120
[ __ ] yeah do you have any desire to try

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.600
or no i'm not gonna try it's like but i

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.199
didn't try to get snl

01:08:37.199 --> 01:08:38.960
right that's just like i'm not gonna try

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.319
well you auditioned

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:41.679
yeah after i

01:08:41.679 --> 01:08:43.920

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.120

yeah yeah damn i was like i'll do that

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.679
you'll do that one i'll do that one so

01:08:51.679 --> 01:08:53.359
if a tv show says that we want you as a

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:54.880
guy on the show if they were like if if

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.120
a tv show asked me to audition i would

i'm not getting auditions but you know

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.960
what i mean but if you asked someone who

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.719
repped you you could

01:09:04.719 --> 01:09:07.520
maybe um but i'm not gonna

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.040
do that

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.560
yeah that's what it is yeah yeah you

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.080
don't want him well i don't i can't

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.520
imagine what show like i don't want to

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.080
audition for just any show right cause i

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.759
was doing that

01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:19.520
you know we

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.640
getting auditions and i was like what

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.920
the [ __ ] is this

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.359
yeah that was after since i've been

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.799
canceled none

01:09:24.799 --> 01:09:26.560
so that's nice it was only like a couple

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.239
months of auditions

01:09:28.239 --> 01:09:30.000
and i sucked at them keep saying cancel

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.159
i [ __ ] it's not you no no of course but

01:09:32.159 --> 01:09:33.520
i don't know how else to say it sure as

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:36.159
soon as i faced my consequences

01:09:36.159 --> 01:09:38.319
for my terrible life that's the thing

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:39.920
like i'll see people get canceled now

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.759
and be like

01:09:41.759 --> 01:09:43.520
it's still kind of funny when people get

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.440
dude when people get yo that guy who got

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.960
cancelled and had to apologize during

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.360
that surprised the country yeah when

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.560
they were like he's going to be an

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.480
announcer everyone you me everyone you

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.560

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.320

peyton is really good at calling stuff

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.080

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.719

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.120
he just knew everything that was about

it's not like any of your comedy leans

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.840
in the fact that women wouldn't want

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.520
like it no i think it's just because a

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.880
lot of people have one woman on your

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.600

38.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.400
what was your did you have tapes you

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.960
didn't have tapes yeah but

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.800
i started my music at the beginning was

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.560
rough i had two older sisters what was

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.080
your first time dude i have two six and

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.000
seven year older sisters than me so like

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.320
my did i would get like aqua

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.239
spice girls i'd get like hand-me-down

01:20:58.239 --> 01:21:00.080
tapes and listen to that vitamins pretty

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:02.320
good vibrancy rules

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.679
holds up vitamin c ribs that's so funny

01:21:05.679 --> 01:21:07.199
my first taste

01:21:07.199 --> 01:21:09.520
that steal my sunshine is phenomenal if

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.159
you steal myself song's great

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:13.840
why was it so funny how so many there

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.199
was some way more one-hit wonders when

01:21:15.199 --> 01:21:18.000
we were young because of radio i guess

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.920
i know but even still like spotify is

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:21.280
more of the radio than the radio was

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.800
because you can put one song on spotify

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.320
and if it goes viral you're straight

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.840
yeah but i feel like

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:26.800
well you're right though there's

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.960
auto-tune much more now and maybe that's

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.040
radio looped it all day sure so if you

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.000
didn't hear it in the morning you heard

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.280
in the afternoon you heard yeah that's

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.639
that's actually probably why also i

01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:36.880
listen to that stuff everybody's gay you

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.320
know you're gay when you're young still

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.159
am yeah yeah when you're a young boy

01:21:40.159 --> 01:21:42.400
you're gay yeah so i had no problem

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.719
being like this aqua cd

01:21:44.719 --> 01:21:46.800
is phenomenal yeah barbie girl and then

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.320
there was some other i used to cry i

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.440
used to cry

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.639
no doubt

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:51.840
yeah no doubt

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.600

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.239
of course mark mcgrath this is good this

01:21:58.239 --> 01:22:01.840
is podcasting it's 101.

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.679

01:22:03.679 --> 01:22:06.239

01:22:29.199 --> 01:22:30.960

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.719
like them yeah they just didn't have the

01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:34.159
