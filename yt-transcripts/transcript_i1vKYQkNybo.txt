the way I might I might I might I might

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:25.430
do like my short long cut I think in

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.730
ones have been relegated effing Utley a

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.739
fashion ecosystem and I think it's like

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.620
the fashion eventually filters down to

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.630
definitely like fat white dudes of fat

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.519
legs that's who wears an one short and

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.889
one shorts or yeah it all trickles down

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:49.660
to just dudes who do heroin sleepy

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.549
should sleep he's got it awawa like

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.349
south pole gear it's just heroin at

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.760
everything filters down to heroin

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.730
addicts it was it a Nietzsche and wants

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.760
a NYC yeah I know how you pronounce it

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.609
yeah I use called ants I think it's a

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.329
Nietzsche I think you're right maybe

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.859
that's totally trickled down so

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.329
basically yeah it does go from like

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.940
black cultures whatever is fashionable a

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.660
decade later white drug users will be

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.169
wearing it they'll be sleeping it like

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.669
feels good it's extra fabric

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.320
true guys are probably like fashioning

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.570
tents out of it true man like a first

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.950
down bubble Jack yet dude that [ __ ]

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.310
perfect for sleeping in Kensington

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.260
that's I think that's actually how like

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.360
I could be wrong I think denim started

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.050
as a tent

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.660
really lemare you're fired

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.919
I know this isn't the climate for us to

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.760
be firing or a minority partner but

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.720
you're [ __ ] fired

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.590
did uh yeah I could be wrong about that

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.330
but I think denim started as a tent

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.669
fabric and then like - miners just

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.020
started wearing them as pants because

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.580
they were durable that's also not a very

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.990
breathable fabric

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.700
you're gonna denim never wake up in a

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.330
tent yes it's [ __ ] hot it sucks the

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.790
tarp it always sucks I've never not any

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.460
shitty experience waking up in a tent I

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.710
bet if you woke up in a tent you would

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.590
just have a nut sweat on your forehead

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.690
and a jean tent yeah just non so just

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.540
your whole body would be crushed wet

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.280
yeah well their lives did suck so I mean

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.530
you just wake up all sweat it out and

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.960
you're just like I is I got a shower

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.610
last night I worked out last night and

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.050
they'd like in no soap shower I call

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.550

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.750
how I used to do it dude you're just

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.760
going to a river like you got to give an

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.229

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.990
dignity munching some bugs

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.370
well if you're farming back in the day

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.110
your crops not going you're like digging

you're going there's been a lot of bug

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.330

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.160
yeah if you're like if you're like a

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.720
17th century farmer and you're sitting

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.890

like just stamp [ __ ] it could it has

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.110
made t-shirts back then they have no

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.769
idea

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:19.029
granting t-shirt if they had like a

00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:21.339
print like a money dollar bill yeah

00:10:21.339 --> 00:10:23.350

00:10:28.839 --> 00:10:31.420
clothes back then sucked yeah but uh so

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.760
these four dudes were trespassing and

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.940
collecting beaver pelts sure which do

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.610
beavers used to get beavers are huge are

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.380

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.410
dude the others are 90 pounds can get up

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.209
to 90 pounds at least back then I'm sure

00:10:49.209 --> 00:10:51.190
they've been killed enough now that

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.779
they're a little you know sure a little

00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:54.190
skimpy little skimpy they're losing

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.110
weight the dinosaur days for beaver

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.750
beavers were 90 pounds these dudes and

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.880
they would trick them as a sad way to

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.800
kill them I don't know they do so they

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.329
put like a trap in the

00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:07.660
water input like female pheromones on

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.639
yeah and when the beaver like stood up

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:11.170
at the top of the stick to rant there

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.670
was a clamp or something that drug it

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.139
under the water how'd they get the

00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:16.119
female beaver pheromones you might even

00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:16.629
want to know

00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:18.160
kill the V yeah you cut them out of them

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.769
and squeeze love it on a stick so you

00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:23.170
have to like you just surgery just like

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.449

00:11:25.449 --> 00:11:27.009
[ __ ] oh yeah a big here's some well

00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:29.350
maybe that's how beaver came out true

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.809
it's a good think they took him for a

00:11:31.809 --> 00:11:35.290
spin three bugs dude you don't think

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.179
you'd be pushed by the way man just got

00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:39.279
charged in Delaware for having sex with

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:42.160
poet and molesting ponies so that's that

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.989
as you as old as time

00:11:43.989 --> 00:11:45.819
do you hear that story what happened

00:11:45.819 --> 00:11:47.529
they there's a Delaware man he's I think

00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:50.470
he's 32 years old there was a fool there

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.759
was an investor so people are coming

00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:53.589
back and seeing the ponies like ankles

00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:55.569

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:57.429
the hell what's wrong with my pony and

00:11:57.429 --> 00:11:59.139
then this guy was going into barns and

00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:00.220
strapped in the poet he was like

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.869
strapped their legs down yeah you get

00:12:01.869 --> 00:12:03.730
those benefits away with them yeah you

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.470
don't get kicked yeah so he really he

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.059

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:09.249
molesting them so I don't know if he was

00:12:09.249 --> 00:12:10.720
penetrating these ponies I think he was

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.230
just like or maybe out a guy yeah that

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.429
was like my first joke

00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:17.709

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:24.610
stand up and you're innocent like if you

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.079
get caught eating [ __ ] like somebody

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.639

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:30.220
what psycho is gonna be like you [ __ ]

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.290
did you see that horses [ __ ] boom

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.360
Comedy Harrisburg commies own exploits

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.519
every single time that was in Perry

00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:38.980

00:12:46.809 --> 00:12:48.519
four dudes get captured by these Indians

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:51.669
the they take them hmm and they make him

00:12:51.669 --> 00:12:53.439
run the gauntlet so that was one thing

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:54.639
they would do when they would capture

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:55.989
prisoners a lot of these tribes would

00:12:55.989 --> 00:12:57.669
make you run a gauntlet like right away

00:12:57.669 --> 00:12:59.169
so the whole town would come to the bank

00:12:59.169 --> 00:13:00.910
of this river when these two dudes they

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.369

War would come up with the term live

00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:08.350
free or die

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.319

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.530

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.330
that you had to hold so I couldn't like

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:09.930
block

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.430
yeah like hold a stick and run through a

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.260
gauntlet and they would all just hit you

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.850
now they tried not to hurt you they try

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.650
not to kill you I mean they wanted just

want to hurt you they won't [ __ ] you up

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.600
but the Indian who captured them who was

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.480
the chief of this tribe told them some

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.030
things to say yeah in their language

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.430
that would like make it easier on them

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.440
which actually translated to like I

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.620

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.010
hit him anymore he's also probably

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:10.740
crying so I was wrong on that part the

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.540
Indians were funny that's for obviously

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.940
a guy the canoe was like here's a hook

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.589
you up this is gonna make things a lot

00:15:16.589 --> 00:15:17.010
easier

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:21.450
oh [ __ ] all the women in here hilarious

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.040
that's this I mean that holds up today

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.750
that joke there's a good bit it's pretty

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.310
good that's a good bit by that out

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.980
gakuen oh that's pretty [ __ ] how fun

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.180
would be to have a gauntlet

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.710
that's the thing like we did in high

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.800
school I know it rules yeah this is what

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.660
people do yeah it's an instinctive thing

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.400
to make people run through a gauntlet

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.370
and it's [ __ ] them up it's laughable all

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.300
the way but yeah then that you know then

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.070
they they did get a little mean yeah

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.380
after that so some of these tribes would

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.050
have like you go cabin to cabin mm-hmm

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:52.890
when you're good at getting

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.320
indoctrinated basically as tortured like

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.630
into the into being a prisoner you tased

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.760
yeah it hazed into it yeah it is like

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.560
you go to this cabin somebody will pluck

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.090
a fingernail out you go the next cabin

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.170
someone will bite your finger off your

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.470
finger one of the cabins was just one of

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.120
the women just beat the [ __ ] out of you

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.040
you couldn't hit back can't you just

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.240
beat you as hard as she could the whole

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.260
time really

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.330
dude it was didn't cut your finger off

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.640
yet eventually yeah this is usually and

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.050
then there's some cabins where it's just

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.490
little kids and they stab you a little

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.560
just just light stabbings man and then

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.730
eventually I think that a lot of them

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.530
would scalp you and then pour boiling

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.660
water on where they just scalped you

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.540
which taught to I felt the fire yeah and

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.100
then just make you roll in like thorn

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.000
bushes but like really mean [ __ ] to

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.820
people so you got to go get the agro

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.830
crap this is a global guy oh this is you

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.840
got chronic you've got [ __ ] crushed

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.170
but the Indians a lot of these tribes so

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.730
that's another thing that is annoying

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.080
obviously I've said it a thousand times

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.490
when people talk about Indians in

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:57.840
America they were always like the

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.430
Indians like it's one group these are

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.590
just so yeah some northeastern woodland

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.180
traps I'm talking about here exactly

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.400
obviously it fluctuates but uh read up

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.810
if you don't know about some of it you

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:11.520
know they also they all like loved being

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.350
able to take pain that was like their

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:16.709
big [ __ ] thing like if you like if if

00:17:16.709 --> 00:17:19.230
your mom cried while giving birth to you

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.150
yeah everybody in the tribe was like ear

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:25.140
[ __ ] bag that stayed with you so even

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.959
moms had to be like toughest [ __ ] the

00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:31.110
whole time like wild [ __ ] possible it's

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.430
possible for women to give birth not

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.560
even just laterally even it's kind of

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.480
like completely they complained not

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.400
allowed to complain dude crazy so it's

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.020
possible the tribes had some good ideas

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.299
dude yes they did basically a quit you

00:17:43.299 --> 00:17:45.730
see two women take knockoff not quit

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:46.659
bitching did

00:17:46.659 --> 00:17:48.970
or your kids gay so it is possible to

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.100
you know maybe you know it's [ __ ]

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.259
harp on it forever sorry please totally

00:17:53.259 --> 00:17:55.749
unrelated also one one that made me

00:17:55.749 --> 00:17:57.820
laugh was one of these Indians like

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.369
recorded how British people acted when

00:18:00.369 --> 00:18:03.549
they got hurt which was Wow Wow that's

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.830
literally Oh like when we scalp them

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:11.919
they just go where me had it oh no

00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:13.749
so that's where the powdered wigs came

00:18:13.749 --> 00:18:15.759
from they go to scalp you the powder

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:17.080
wing would slide off and you just be

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.100
like powdered wigs were treated like

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.259
black ladies weaves what are they gonna

00:18:23.259 --> 00:18:28.690
fight if he's don't you guys get a fight

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.070
in the Senate there's a powdered wig

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.840
anyway that was funny it's been fun

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.820
stuff reading up on that so the gauntlet

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.379
though so at the end after a guy bit

00:18:38.379 --> 00:18:41.080
your finger off I mean woman dominatrix

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.299
you and then a little kid [ __ ] needle

00:18:43.299 --> 00:18:45.429
do you what would happen you just be

00:18:45.429 --> 00:18:47.080
like oh like a roller coaster but here's

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.820
your's or have you being a [ __ ] about

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.009
this pretty much they but there was also

00:18:51.009 --> 00:18:53.320
examples of dudes getting tortured and

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.759
like laughing and making fun of the

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.409
Indians at which point a lot of the

00:18:56.409 --> 00:18:57.879
Indians would kind of like let him live

00:18:57.879 --> 00:19:01.359
he were like yo you're tough or another

00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:02.739
thing they would adopt they adopted a

00:19:02.739 --> 00:19:03.879
lot because a lot of these tribes were

00:19:03.879 --> 00:19:05.919
like sustenance farming and [ __ ] like

00:19:05.919 --> 00:19:07.179
that where they didn't have a lot of

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:09.220
manpower especially at this point with

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.649
the comest there so they would just take

00:19:11.649 --> 00:19:14.619
dudes in yeah you're one of us now but

00:19:14.619 --> 00:19:15.759
your finger off first you got your

00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:17.499
finger off that guy you could stay there

00:19:17.499 --> 00:19:19.749
was one guy that get one guy got adopted

00:19:19.749 --> 00:19:21.820
and was like literally from that alt

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.639
dude he got adopted by a dude slowly

00:19:24.639 --> 00:19:26.139
just because he obviously couldn't speak

00:19:26.139 --> 00:19:27.909
the [ __ ] language hmm so he sat down

00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:29.559
an old dude in the cabin started

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:31.869
plucking his hair out like he was he

00:19:31.869 --> 00:19:34.450
likened it to like a bird but yeah he

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.399
like just ripping the feathers out to

00:19:36.399 --> 00:19:38.019
start ripping all his hair out and left

00:19:38.019 --> 00:19:40.269
a patch in the front and he didn't you

00:19:40.269 --> 00:19:41.259
know he didn't realize at the time but

00:19:41.259 --> 00:19:43.330
he was giving him their haircut that's

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.789
how they cut hair barbers jaws and the

00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:47.230
tribe was rough dude he gave him the

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.950
number four on the wall

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.210
and then the chief came in it was like

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.159
oh you're one of us now and he was like

00:19:57.159 --> 00:19:59.230
literally from that day no one in that

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.929
tribe treated me remotely different like

00:20:01.929 --> 00:20:03.249
all it took was the chief being like

00:20:03.249 --> 00:20:05.409
he's one of us and everyone's like so so

00:20:05.409 --> 00:20:07.389
bro that was it dude also too it's like

00:20:07.389 --> 00:20:08.860
you know I was trying to be like well

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.119
could I be friends with people who bit

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:11.769
my finger off and had their wife beat me

00:20:11.769 --> 00:20:13.929
up and yelled at me it's like imagine

00:20:13.929 --> 00:20:15.129
the apathy you know and they like our

00:20:15.129 --> 00:20:16.389
idea we're gonna let you loose now and

00:20:16.389 --> 00:20:17.669
my other options to live in the woods

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:20.289
yeah first just doing that alone without

00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:21.850
people who are biting my finger off

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.159
imprison me yeah just if there's anybody

00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:25.659
they could be so mean to me and they no

00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:26.919
but you're still part of the thing I

00:20:26.919 --> 00:20:28.570
thank you just thanks and all oh yeah if

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.330
I starve to death next to one guy one

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.690
guy got adopted and he they baby he was

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.360
like a slave and he was doing like farm

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.100
work and eventually he like threw his

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.080
hoe into the river and was like this is

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.970
for women and all the Indians were like

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:48.610
sick this guy's awesome so the Indians

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.789
did have cool [ __ ] codes you know he

00:20:51.789 --> 00:20:53.259
risked his life to be like this is chick

00:20:53.259 --> 00:21:00.100
words you passed the test

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.049
yeah and also the nobody's sick at the

00:21:02.049 --> 00:21:03.700
Last Samurai the final test him like

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:13.899
this is [ __ ] gay but they uh too many

00:21:13.899 --> 00:21:17.940
minds he's like everything's [ __ ] gay

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.830
yes he's learning yes he's learning our

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.320
ways that's [ __ ] sick means color

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.240
girls yeah you threw his ho into the

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.059
river and they're all like this is good

00:21:28.059 --> 00:21:32.619
respect that are good just had it been

00:21:32.619 --> 00:21:33.879
white guys out there that bit other

00:21:33.879 --> 00:21:35.559
white guys fingers eventually you came

00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:36.999
home and started biting finger no say

00:21:36.999 --> 00:21:43.299
like it's how you become tribe white

00:21:43.299 --> 00:21:45.610
fingers off is that's like the third or

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.169
fourth reference they've made to it so

00:21:47.169 --> 00:21:50.080
Sebastian Junger left that out safe to

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.369
say that some of the natives were

00:21:51.369 --> 00:21:54.759
munching fingers hard for sure Mel on

00:21:54.759 --> 00:21:56.350
your figure off this is an old gotcha

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.389
just let me see your finger close your

00:21:58.389 --> 00:22:04.500
eyes bite your finger off oh man uh

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.640
now I'm saying I wondered if any

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.680
settlers joy he's a lot of those dudes

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.120
stayed with the with the tribes even

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.010
people ran away from settlements they

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.660
stayed with the tribe I wonder if there

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.100
hadn't been someone who bit somebody

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.630
like someone like John Smith's third

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:16.860
cause and definitely probably bit

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.460
someone's finger off yeah I'm sure

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.960
if you hang on that culture long enough

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.090
you're gonna nibble a finger what's also

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.130
funny too like it's if so like they have

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.900
adopted like European dudes

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.610
so you're just like running your the

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:30.900
gauntlet all the sudden you come to the

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.400
next tent with a white dude in it you're

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:46.940
like dude yeah but yet then they also

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.070
Robert Rogers who the books about wrote

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.540
down that he was like there's also

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.080
literally zero uh wealth disparity like

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.120
everybody is the execs like you you

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.770
can't you're not allowed to do anything

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.450
if your neighbors poor can't forget I

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.000
helped them yeah which you know good

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.450
quality hmm I think it's easy to be that

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.650
when you guys are all living in [ __ ]

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.350
tents though sure you know yeah it's

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.200
pretty easy to be spreading the wealth

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.600
when there's zero wealth it was also

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.340
really physical back then to like you

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.860
you're like it wasn't like you know like

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.450
bitcoins and fiat currency it was like

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.640
you have six goats some guy has two and

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.460
you're like here dude have two [ __ ]

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.770
yeah yeah or whatever it's like here bro

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.840
have a [ __ ] Pelt yeah so they didn't

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.450
have good good [ __ ] I would need to also

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.890
do a thing where they would whoever had

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.300
the most stuff would burn all their [ __ ]

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.580
well it was we had to do that they had

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.200
one I forgot afraid it was but they'd

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.310
have a thing where if you like the dude

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.620
at the top ceremony would just like get

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.640
rid of all the [ __ ]

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.810
that's like Bill Gates give it to

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.640
charity true it's pretty much all we do

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.170
yeah they would back then the Native

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.000
Americans would give away like a large

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.350
proceeding of all the stuff ahead and

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.990
secretly develop a you know a little

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:57.390
shot based on your genetics dude nobody

00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:59.940
wants that shot by the way really a lot

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.050
of people I talked to were like I'm not

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.730
[ __ ] I one person is like I'll take

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.200
my chances on that a lot of people are

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.780
like so they're gonna rush the vaccine I

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:07.920
can't think of that word they're gonna

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.420
rush a vaccine and they're they're

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.860
saying it's not an inert form of the

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.300
virus so it's not like the old you know

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.190
they say we give you a virus like it's

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.620
like a it's it's dead it's kind of like

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.310
half alive and you're like okay

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.080
sense it's not that they're like no no

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.460
it's just like you know it's just like a

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.840
genetic sequence that goes yeah their

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.990
genome and I don't think I've ever once

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:27.130
until obviously recently I don't think

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.870
I've ever once like even asked what a

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.120
vaccine was yeah I think I've always

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.680
just like if I don't even think I've

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.630
ever gotten a flu shot it's a good stuff

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:35.800
oh here's the good stuff you won't get

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.210
sick literally there's a good side here

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.710
we have to give you three shots today my

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.270
[ __ ] oh [ __ ]

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:43.540
never ask what it is yeah yeah yeah man

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.310
well that's the Bill Gates was saying

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.530
like a man look we're not this is just

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.260
genetic stuff don't worry about the weak

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.780
around a weak good genetics

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:53.920
it's not a virus you put through the

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.230
gauntlet this is [ __ ] just gauntlets

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.570
tight we need to break oh you need to

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.210
bring the gauntlet back big time dude

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.290
well dude how about we might we might

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.030
have the gauntlet there's a minnesota's

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:06.160
going there defunding their police and

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.290
tying that [ __ ] governor or the mayor

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.360
of Minneapolis could there any Apple

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.490
your [ __ ] dork for defunding the

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.440
hopefully now just him in general I

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.500
didn't see it I saw the guy yeah I don't

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.150
know maybe he's a good person I haven't

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:20.950
seen too much about him but I did see

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.470
him in front of like a black in front of

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:24.250
a protest

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.860
mmm-hmm they were like yes or no are you

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.440
gonna do fund the police and he was like

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.110
no Big Buddha but he had to walk out

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.120
well he did it now and then now he's

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.680
like I thought about it and you guys

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.420
were right so I'm actually doing it it's

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.890
also funny too because it's like you

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.930
know he's the mayor so he's there to

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.250
represent everyone there like like

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.510
what's what are you guys going for

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.680
tonight we want to defund the police and

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.700
he's like yeah but dude apparently so I

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.750
thought it because that's the thing to a

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.670
lot of these issues get filtered through

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:52.930
like you know which news channel do you

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.280
watch it at first I read it and I was

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.410
like we can't get rid of the police we

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:57.640
need to please every time I get pulled

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.230
over I'm like [ __ ] get these guys to

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.200
[ __ ] out here so I'm all the way

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.700
filtering it through like oh like I'm

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.170
doing my thing of like yeah the people I

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:06.580
hated at my school are winning somehow

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.290
and I was like wait a second so I read

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.990
the whole thing and I'm like it might

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.870
not be a bad idea to have like well

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.340
they're saying is try to do it we're

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.070
like you'd have a local everything's

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.480
dealt with locally so of course there's

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.700
ways that can go off track so so so

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:22.840
[ __ ] hard it's like if you need an

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.920
example look at the rest of the world

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.010
but it's like yeah also if you know if

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:28.000
there's like these was they're saying

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.220
like the police have to go and take care

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.140
of these like weirdly regress

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.300
simply pursuing like minor violations

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.740
where they're like hey there's a law

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:36.970
that says you can't stand right there

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:38.290
and like you know I don't know I want to

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:39.430
stand right here [ __ ] you dude then

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:40.420
you're fighting over this weird

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.190
violation where it's like if that was

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.140
people who live there it's like the

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.060
older dudes who live there were able to

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.770
be like in women excuse me or a living

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:49.630
there could just be like hey I know

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.940
everybody another excuse me knows excuse

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.790
and everything the probably not the

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.170
right word that's not very inclusive oh

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.940
there's no I saw that it stems them's

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.520
damn damn [ __ ] them stems Daisy's

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.890
gonna be there no but it's um if instead

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:04.930
of a guy just being like you can't stand

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.790
this spot move and it's like [ __ ] you

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.950
[ __ ] you now you're arrested just a guy

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.140
you know being like yo man get the [ __ ]

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.850
outta here your body on that lady so I

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:14.950
don't know maybe it would work but wait

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:16.900
who's the other guy they would hire

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.640
people within the community would be it

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.380
would be in community intra community

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.340
policing alright so again highly again

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.780
if people were like this is a good idea

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.060
it's like check out just do me a favor

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.140
and check out the rest of the world

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.760
first because this can be easily

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.690
corruptible dude yeah well you say

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:35.800
that's getting picked up a little oh

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.910
that guy are you just nodding yeah

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.010
defunding the police might get corrupted

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:49.060
a little yeah so I mean I'm saying as a

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.460
could they sit as the vigilante squads

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.070
that people are gonna it would be good

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.650
maybe maybe those vigilantes could get

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.210
out of hand at some point well this is

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.650
the Oh for sure but then and this is the

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:01.660
argument with the uh well any anything

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.920
is gonna get corrupted for sure I know

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.540
this is like [ __ ] [ __ ] we should

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.190
just pause yeah as these hammers picking

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:14.320
up well now they're not okay perfect I

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.700
was actually I don't if you notice how

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.200
strategically spiky Monday's you're

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.460
fired up well this is the so here's the

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.400
I was up again I'm initially against it

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.450
but then they're like it won't it's not

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:26.620
dislike because I thought it was just

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.600
like no more cops but it would be you

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.980
would slowly be like four start

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.260
replacing people who are going into like

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.940
places that are like so bombed out and

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.010
poor with guys just being like what are

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:37.840
you smoking [ __ ] weed bad and like

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.520
[ __ ] pile-driving you with like

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.750
people going through and be like

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.060
everybody you're cool and then you know

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.580
saving that Task Force for like serious

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.140
[ __ ] rather

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.760
DUS walking that's the other thing too

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.740
it's like no one thinks about like cops

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.210
don't just roll around all day and like

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.400
hit people and leave it's like one like

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.320
that some dude some like six-year-old

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.550
dude who's been living by himself for

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.930
thirty years like dies from like

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.940
diabetes they're all so the guys have to

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.920
go like lift dead bodies out and like

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.050
[ __ ] yeah throw them out so it's like

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:05.760
you know who wants to do that or you

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.010
sign up for that as well yeah I wonder

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.840
if that you know the vigilante squads

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.450
are gonna or the what's not vigilantes

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.640
color we call them it would be so

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.770
everything the police's work would be

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:18.570
and this is where it does make sense you

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:19.920
would look at the job of policing a

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.080
community and it's like we still have

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.580
the idea that like you have to roll like

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.280
you must have you think everything's

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.540
dealt with with the force of the police

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.890
where you could try it with like three

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.870
or four ways first then they was don't

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.730
work and then it's like you have a copy

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.800
roll to a guy like a 302 there's a crazy

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.300
dude and there could be people like

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.980
social workers not to my own horn but

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.300
you could have people who go out there

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.250
like hey you work like you're trained in

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.450
like common people down rather than

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:43.800
being like shut up you're crazy

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.840
[ __ ] shut the [ __ ] up yeah yeah

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.520
a lot of cops just lacked a sophisticate

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.650
wasn't there one of those was there like

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.300
is really autistic through the cut shop

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.510
anyhow like with the social worker there

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:56.040
that's also I could be wrong well there

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.990
was a guy timba Timothy Tim but I

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:59.220
remember seeing it where they were like

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.260
in the street getting shot the social

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.480
worker was like no no no yeah no she's

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.330
[ __ ] to kill that baby close these

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:07.950
retards or a threat put them down

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.300
oh that's the problem it's like dude

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.060
it's I automatically reacted to it like

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.560
what are we gonna have [ __ ] cops at

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.090
all but it's if you read it it's like

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:17.640
nah that's yeah the issue but and again

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.710
we'll see dude well [ __ ] happens I mean

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.720
I don't know I was just laughing

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.670
thinking about like yeah it'll be just

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:26.040
you know neighborhood watch and then

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.420
like you know five years from now

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.310
they'll be like we should we should get

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.770
a place to work from so all right we've

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.810
got a neighborhood watch station mmm

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:35.100
maybe we should get them uniforms all

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.410
right yeah neighborhood watch it would

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:38.060
get them cars

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.520
well we'll buy them a tank I think

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.780
that's oh [ __ ] we got the car I think

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.540
that's the best we can do though is just

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.890
reset every like so many years and make

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.810
yeah here's the new move and then we

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.520
just reset never knows this is cool and

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.020
slowly we just get [ __ ] corrupted

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.400
that's it that's kind of the you know

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.260
it's kind of overall deal and all of its

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.420
full and sinister glory dude yeah that

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.770
eventually everything does get corrupt

00:30:58.770 --> 00:30:59.820
yes well you just got to keep

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.250
reset yeah well eventually any position

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:03.900
where people have a say or a powered

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.400
it's they just attract [ __ ]

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.530
sociopaths like [ __ ] like flies and

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.300
eventually they're really good at

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.500
getting into power so then they'd

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.790
actually get into power and they're like

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.290
I mean it's Lion King bro

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.660
that's why you got to be [ __ ] not

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.860
Mufasa who's the other one

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.950
Simba I bet Simba dude he's always as

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.790
always scarred dude flow it in over one

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.470
over one on your chimein Schlemmer is

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:28.710
your mic on ya know they hold like if

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:36.270
it's not on why are you talking what

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.220
mayor please clip up just that before

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.180
your song you know but yeah that that'll

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.290
be interesting because again I was like

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:45.690
thinking about it I'm like that might be

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.100
pretty [ __ ] so cuz then if it boils

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.440
down to like so you know I think we

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.000
should be legal the reason weeds not

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.830
illegal is it's not legal is because

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:54.360
there's these dudes who drive around in

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.850
golf shirts on Pacific blue bicycles and

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.410
they'll be like you smoking [ __ ]

00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:59.730
wheat it's happened to me countless

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:01.470
[ __ ] time yeah like you're smoking

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:02.790
[ __ ] they get all jacked up on you

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.530
and you're like what the [ __ ] man yeah

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:06.300
70% of the country agrees that should be

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.950
legal get your [ __ ] huffy and your

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.870
[ __ ] mailman shorts out of here what

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.820
did you see a herd of bike cop said yeah

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.740
I saw one clip pretty great it's crazy

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.260
line of bike cops versus the riders yeah

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.480
there's Road testers and the bike cops

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.090
were cool like Spartans with their

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:22.040
[ __ ] office

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.870
pushed it against all the dorks it's

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.080
great here they started spraying and hit

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:28.830
people with bikes

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.360
well that's the thing bike cops work

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.980
constantly because they're cut they're

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.360
like anything when anything pops off

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.130
they mobilize bike cops as a whole not

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.110
every cop gets to be Pacific blue that's

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.150
like it's also by the way one of our

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.040
friends lost one of her friends [ __ ]

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.220
gotta like bike thieves but it was bike

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.040
thieves while a guy on a bike like an

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.230
old horse thief dude biked up next to

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:51.030
him cut him off and was like give me

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:52.470
your he's like let me see that bike he

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.850
said come here ID your bike and our

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.460
friend was like nah man he's like give

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.110
me your [ __ ] basically basically as I

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.820
give me your [ __ ] bike and I guess

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.410
like an old horse thief Road or no he

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:02.730
actually is funny he had the rental like

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:06.260
the city bike he wrote on the side of it

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.580
no you [ __ ] him in the midst of all the

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.340
chaos he he went I guess Jack tower

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.680
buddy of his bike yeah but he had he

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.240
rented a bike like one of the blue city

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.130
bikes this was a rogue he ditched yeah

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.020
you know he rose we got him he ditched

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.090
the [ __ ] a city bike hopped on his

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.590
nicer bike but it's like you had to rent

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.020
a city bike through a credit card so I'm

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.190
selling our buddy I'm like why didn't

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.480
you just grab the city bike and try to

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.770
figure out what credit card that was on

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.420
but then it's like we're gonna solve the

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.860
case of the dude who stole your bike in

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.210
broad daylight like clearly doesn't give

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.000
a [ __ ] about credit cards yeah probably

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.490
used here he was like stealing the bike

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:39.720
he's like [ __ ] my credit score my

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.330
[ __ ] drop [ __ ] I think about this

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:44.640
it's a good maneuver though an old one

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.880
up stealing bikes Oh bike thief dude

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.040
broad yeah yeah yeah dude it was a case

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.920
of that when I was in Key West buy the

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.080
bike thieves come through everybody down

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.090
there has cool bikes Church like

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:58.890
something the culture and Key West does

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.990
yeah but I get like tricycles like this

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:05.390
yeah uh where those called yeah hi uh

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.680
baby but I call them baby boys your

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.280
riders it's something excuse me anyway

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.500
um hi handles bike thieves come through

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.450
they could they come down from Miami and

00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:21.179
steal all the poor folks bikes do they

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.399
chop them off the lock or do they like

00:34:23.399 --> 00:34:26.010
actively pirate their bike pyar the bike

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:27.990
straight on is [ __ ] nice but no they

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:30.300
don't they well it's the only thing that

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.950
I give mean in terms of my critique on

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:33.510
this guy's maneuver the best thing would

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.220
be to be ride a bike parallel to

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.440
somebody and jump on it like on there

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.360
yeah and if you can break that thing if

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.980
you could break that in it's yours ooh

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.070
Drive that is pretty tight if you should

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.780
that should be a new bike law and we

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.130
have new police that like if you see a

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:48.540
bike better than yours if you can jump

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.649
off yours or theirs

00:34:49.649 --> 00:34:51.659
you can board it like a [ __ ] like a

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.440
turtle shell like a hermit crab

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.909
just [ __ ] hop off yours then if you

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:58.950
get on there if you can fight them while

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:00.990
on their bicycle and remove them that

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:03.090
should be your bike at that point yeah

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.400
it seems back to the police thing about

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:09.390
them like mmm enforcing [ __ ] like you're

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.710
not allowed to stand there at this time

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.150
like she like that seems like that

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.850
should be a law change versus who's

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.390
enforcing it change slightly

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.160
but this is this is a problem though the

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.540
reason people complain there's the

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.250
residents themselves being like I don't

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.050
want a bunch of kids standing outside my

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.480
house making much noise and [ __ ] so

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.730
that's that's the thing so it's like if

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:30.560
that you know no one that's the case if

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.960
some dude from your communities like yo

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.100
you guys are bothering mrs.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.590
what's-her-name get the [ __ ] out of here

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:38.450
rather than some dude being like what's

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:39.110
up guys

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:40.340
Yuma need you to get the [ __ ] egg

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.320
it's like calm out rabbit habla it's

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.170
just maybe that's tough then that guy

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:48.680
whoever the town townsman was that came

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.720
over and told them to leave now he's got

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.730
[ __ ] six kids who know exactly who he

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:53.840
is and where he lives

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.720
okay yeah sure there's some problems

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.840
with enforcing laws locally like that no

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.930
I I hear the positives possible

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.580
positives again I'm not sold there's

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.980
pasta it was I was like and then with

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.150
the whole reason I'm obviously I'm

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:09.830
selfish all I'm thinking about is like

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:11.240
you're telling me there won't be guys

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.100
like being weird about people smoking

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.810

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.180

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.970
yesterday it's [ __ ] great I guess I

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:27.950

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.210

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.940
finally they like exploded and he had to

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.530
he had to pull it it was a lad I think

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:50.690
he's at cowboy hat on what took a Dodge

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.450
Durango on the run for speeding I think

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:54.860
he was probably if I had to assume

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.260
illegal you think Zephyr trying to run

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.880
like that I'll tell you what's speeding

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.550
if you're legal in a country that's a

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:02.930
good way to go out a high-speed chase

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:05.060
it's like let me just what the [ __ ] do I

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.080
have to this guy's about to boot me

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.000
anyway let me do if I can see what I got

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.050
yeah I'm gonna see if I can get out of

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:10.580
here who's headed back towards Mexico I

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.350
think was he yeah he's headed that way

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:14.720
but you said a Mexico way he was headed

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.790
back down all right you got me you got

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:20.710
me I'm going back I'm go back base

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.270
believe I'm just gonna leave it's not a

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.160
big deal but now is he wheels exploded

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.460
but was hilarious the the news guy in

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.890
the chopper was literally it was talking

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.299
he had seen this every single day of his

00:37:32.299 --> 00:37:34.519
life it was just like oh this is pretty

00:37:34.519 --> 00:37:37.150
good one we got going here hopefully uh

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.349
anyway what's going on it's just like

00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:41.119
talking while this guy was running for

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:41.660
his life

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.250
oh it's very uncomfortable then again

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:44.390
the guy's wheels blew off and he was

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.400
like this isn't the news guy was like

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.779
this is pretty much like a Dodge Durango

00:37:47.779 --> 00:37:49.400
commercial at this point this thing's

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.089
still going this is incredible yeah the

00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:55.130
potato piece full conclusion which I was

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.470
hoping they had the canines dude part of

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:58.910
me wanted to see I came out jump in that

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.220
passenger side window get him get nuts

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.680
but now the I assume lad based on the

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.109
cowboy hat true could have been a hunk

00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:09.529
but the lad got out perfectly complied

00:38:09.529 --> 00:38:11.000
with everything hands on the head walked

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.559
backwards he was having trouble with the

00:38:12.559 --> 00:38:13.970
language at first with the hands up or

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:15.890
behind the head yeah that could he

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:18.289
almost got probably shot for that true

00:38:18.289 --> 00:38:20.059
especially the big cowboy hat yeah

00:38:20.059 --> 00:38:24.140
you're expecting the quick-draw if

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.279
someone's wearing a cowboy hat you know

00:38:25.279 --> 00:38:26.660
they have fast hands probably he might

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.950
have the fastest hands in the area at

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.170
the time dude probably that's the best

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.240
thing about when lads get fly I've said

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.069
it before dude it's cowboy gear dude

00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:36.680
it's the sickest gear possible when lads

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.799
get fly is nothing but cowboy gear I

00:38:39.799 --> 00:38:41.690

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:16.880
was killing me my friend uh O'Leary I

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.230
was hanging out with Hurley at a bar

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:21.079
Mechanicsburg went out it's nice yeah

00:41:21.079 --> 00:41:22.880
nice to be back he was talking about how

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.099
he heard it on another podcast so was

00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:26.960
probably one of our friends I just

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.180
didn't hear it but he was like uh

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.540
Trump's never laughed like you've never

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.520
seen footage of Trump like actually

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.910
laughing like yes just a quick smile

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:39.800
laughs he goes oh he's like yeah it's

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.210
always because he and then I was like

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.180
dude it's because of Trump's autistic

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:45.920
think so I don't think he's ever shown

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.550
like real emotion or knows how to like

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.140
think about you've definitely seen Obama

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.790
laughing's definitely see sure laughing

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:54.980
yeah see all of them like having a human

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.900
moment of laughing Trump will trump camp

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.319
I could be

00:41:58.319 --> 00:41:59.849
I want to see what I have to genuinely

00:41:59.849 --> 00:42:01.140
don't remember seeing him laugh which

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.660
makes me laugh a lot

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.950
thanks for yeah him I'm trying things

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:09.029
always like but he's like Kanye would

00:42:09.029 --> 00:42:10.559
that like smile and then back to

00:42:10.559 --> 00:42:13.019
straight yeah seen Kanye laughs a bunch

00:42:13.019 --> 00:42:13.789
of times though

00:42:13.789 --> 00:42:15.630
yeah I wonder course I've yeah I've

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:16.680
definitely only ever seen he goes like

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.869
this he goes like you know like doing a

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:21.119
quick smile thing he'd literally that

00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:23.190
face you go yeah here's a quick side

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:26.460
smile and that's it possibly dude I

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.099
don't talk tongue or is probably just

00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:30.839
all part of left final part of the play

00:42:30.839 --> 00:42:32.250
which I know which does seem something

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:33.930
like would be part of his plan like you

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:36.869
can't let them see laughs laughing he's

00:42:36.869 --> 00:42:39.839
gay there's also people who probably

00:42:39.839 --> 00:42:42.410
haven't laughed in a very long time I

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.339
mean there's people I don't think

00:42:44.339 --> 00:42:45.690
there's too many billionaires that

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:49.619
haven't although I don't meet me wrong

00:42:49.619 --> 00:42:50.910
if I was Trump I probably wouldn't be

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:52.619
having the time of my life right now

00:42:52.619 --> 00:42:54.619
yeah probably won't be laughing too much

00:42:54.619 --> 00:42:56.579
yeah I don't think your laugh your way

00:42:56.579 --> 00:42:59.039
to a billion bucks that much though you

00:42:59.039 --> 00:43:00.299
know once you have it you probably laugh

00:43:00.299 --> 00:43:02.579
I don't know dude cuz like you'd think

00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:04.319
once you had five hundred million

00:43:04.319 --> 00:43:06.119
dollars you'd laugh people laugh

00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:07.440
everybody literally every other

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.630
president has been seen laughing I got a

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:11.970
verify we did not see Trump laughing van

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.319
Buren you gave me a good shot of am

00:43:13.319 --> 00:43:15.569
Buuren cracking up then Martin had tons

00:43:15.569 --> 00:43:20.009
of laughs oh sure yeah I mean it's a

00:43:20.009 --> 00:43:22.259
solid theory but I'm like I'm wondering

00:43:22.259 --> 00:43:23.640
now there's guys there's people I know

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.109
people are like I don't like music I'm

00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:27.240
always like what you just don't listen

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.369
to it they're like they like it yeah

00:43:29.369 --> 00:43:30.930
gotta be people who there I actually I

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:32.369
know there's people for a fact who don't

00:43:32.369 --> 00:43:35.970
laugh drum we were just like Trump and

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.099
like a couple other Isaiah it's ugly

00:43:38.099 --> 00:43:40.259
pretty rare just to be like I usually

00:43:40.259 --> 00:43:41.309
know I knew a guy who would like when

00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:42.440
something funny happened he like

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.059
hilarious never laughed he just would

00:43:45.059 --> 00:43:46.230
state that it was hilarious

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:48.539
yeah that's Trump might laughing you

00:43:48.539 --> 00:43:50.039
might just be like a verbal after my big

00:43:50.039 --> 00:43:52.259
hello it's so funny wow really funny

00:43:52.259 --> 00:43:54.450

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:56.039
making me feel some kind of way even

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:48.730
theories valid dude it's not my theory I

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.109
think a different podcast has covered

00:44:50.109 --> 00:44:51.760
this but it was recently brought to my

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.080
attention that Trump has never been

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.200
filmed laughing which as soon as yeah I

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.050
can't even imagine him laughing well

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:00.790
I'll be curious I think someone's gonna

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:01.780
hit you with some footage of this

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.369
someone's gonna find the UFO sighting

00:45:03.369 --> 00:45:05.080
Trump laughs dude the Trump life's tough

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.030
to come by even though I remember him on

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:10.570
Stern he wasn't really like yeah even

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:12.340
when he was funny he wouldn't laugh like

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.930
he would do something funny and not

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.210
laugh do you think he was always about

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:17.950
to get his dick sucked it's like

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:19.630
anything he was doing his dick sucked

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:20.890
he's gonna his dick sucked right after

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:22.359
so he just kind of always in a rush his

00:45:22.359 --> 00:45:24.070
dick sucked maybe funny joke and he's

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:25.810
like I can see the humor in that get my

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:28.090
dick sucked in half an hour true true

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:29.410
there are things better than laughing

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:31.330
about the link up with F Jeffery right

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:32.410

that is cool first so we had a Williams

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:13.549
Grover the speedway mmm there used to be

00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:15.770
a amusement park there it's now listed

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:17.839
as like a haunted amusement park it's

00:50:17.839 --> 00:50:19.309
just an abandoned amusement park yeah

00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:20.839
but we used to go when we were kids like

00:50:20.839 --> 00:50:22.730
while it was still abandoned like the

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:26.119
[ __ ] roller coaster was like the

00:50:26.119 --> 00:50:27.920
scariest roller coaster possible because

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.210
the thing was falling the [ __ ] part

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.250
like the whole time but the ghost house

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:32.510
the haunted house like you would

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.430
supposed to sit in a chair it would you

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:35.540
know take you around but we would just

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.770
get out yeah

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.450
and run around in the ghost house while

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:39.740
that which was very dangerous because

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:40.950
there were carts moving around

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:44.130
flying around no [ __ ] yeah dude being a

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:46.380
carnie being able to do that 24/7 would

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.150
be sick also we used to clog the

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:50.970
waterslide you ever do that no oh you

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:52.230
would sit so there was literally zero

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.329
regulation on this waterslide obviously

00:50:54.329 --> 00:50:57.900
[ __ ] Williams robe so we'd send I was

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.180
usually a wedge breaker mm-hmm has the

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:02.430
biggest yeah you feel free like four or

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:04.020
five my friends would go first and then

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.760
all stop at a certain spot is the

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.530
funnest thing in the [ __ ] world cuz

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:09.510
you'd be going around these curves and

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:13.130
then you'd go around one curve like

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:15.720
slamming and it's funny when you when

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:16.859
you're waiting for somebody because the

00:51:16.859 --> 00:51:18.030
water comes first

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:21.030
like all of a sudden there's like it was

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:27.089
slight wave yeah you break I mean we

00:51:27.089 --> 00:51:28.200
used to do it every summer

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.540
Oh countless wedges we do it all day it

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.950
was the fun that you're working you're

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:33.960
just like Jesus because they single with

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:34.950
each other when they thought with you

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:36.270
and then there's probably just signal

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:37.680
they're like [ __ ] them send them

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.150
together there's they're annoying up

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:40.710
here well dude I used to go down a thing

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:41.820
and then I talked about it before called

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.369
the Alpine Slide when we would go to me

00:51:44.369 --> 00:51:45.869
my my parents would bring us to

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:48.240
somewhere in the Poconos where they do

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.099
this like once a year where was just a

00:51:50.099 --> 00:51:51.810
slide but made out of concrete

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:53.190
yeah and they gave you like a little

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:55.050
like those things calling a devil

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:56.490
scooter not devil sticks it was like

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:57.960
there should be these things you could

00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.390
sit on there yeah it was it was a seat

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:02.579
up wheels so they give you a seat with

00:52:02.579 --> 00:52:04.050
wheels and you went down they had like

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:05.849
advanced easy and then you just sat on a

00:52:05.849 --> 00:52:07.470
seat with wheels and flew down like a

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:10.380
concrete hill everyone you would fall

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:13.230
off and my scrape before most relieve

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.119
this it it can't still be there there's

00:52:15.119 --> 00:52:18.119
no way yeah yeah I think we've had this

00:52:18.119 --> 00:52:19.500
conversation before cuz then it brought

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.170
me to that kid who got his head chopped

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:25.440
off on that waterslide pretty sick on a

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.780
waterslide yeah he was like when it was

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.099
one of those water slides it's just a

00:52:29.099 --> 00:52:31.170
straight draft piece lie yeah I guess

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:33.630

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:37.109
know when you're getting lift yeah but I

00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:38.730
think he got too much lift and his head

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:41.880
got caught on the fencing and his head

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:45.119
ripped off and then his I think his

00:52:45.119 --> 00:52:47.430
parents were at the bottom yeah so just

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:51.060
a pool flood anyway his head yeah then

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.920
they had to sue like it was like the

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.000

to send over a bunch of smallpox

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:59.020
smallpox blankets to the white man with

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.940
just through the form of worthless

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:03.250
trinkets that's how we're gonna be

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:04.750
remembered the same way like you know

00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:06.280
when we sold [ __ ] to the Indians we're

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.840

I'm laughing too about our like the

00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:20.800
Internet's gonna become

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.020
the most like complex technology he's

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:24.160
probably gonna span through like

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.570
different planets and [ __ ]

00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:27.490
yeah it's just like we're gonna be the

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:29.080
cave paintings on there just a guy be

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.200
like fact said if I hit of a planet

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.360
instead of a buffalo on the wall is just

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:39.370
gonna be like thanks a [ __ ] all the time

00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:40.780
it's funny about whatever they found

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.250
cave paintings that were like that oh

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:44.050
they must be just never reported them it

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:46.630
was just again [ __ ] it's just them it

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:47.890
was just an only other tribe gay

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:50.410
different a while he was doing it they

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:53.650
just kept carving [ __ ] into the rocks I

00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:55.150
mean it hadn't been no better than a

00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:56.980
[ __ ] like porta potti saw in terms of

00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:00.490
like the content yeah I mean the thing

00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:02.350
is is I think for the most part back

00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:04.390
then there's like nobody could do what

00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:06.280
those guys were doing really yeah when I

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.600
came in like painting stuff in like

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.920
carving [ __ ] into the rock so it was

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.050
like I think a select few who could do

00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:13.810
it I think or we only found a few maybe

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:16.030
there were there had to be that I'm

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:17.680
thinking about it there had to be the

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.510
basically every cave was the inside of

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:21.070
it like a bathroom stall like a truck

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:23.020

them in a battlefield where they belong

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:37.030
yeah they kept tearing down statues who

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:39.310
decides that like well you know if

01:00:39.310 --> 01:00:40.600
you're a black person that lives in like

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.310
New Orleans and there's a Confederate

01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:44.410
General on every block yeah it's like

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:46.660

01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:12.370
honorably

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:15.160
true and then the day he you know he

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.990
plans fought hard he was a good general

01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:20.650

out yeah I got him now that it is a

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.770
slippery slope where it comes down to

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:38.440
just like hey [ __ ] Jefferson had

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.480
slaves take down all his [ __ ] all that

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.630
stuff but it's not a bad start to be

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:46.290
like maybe Confederate yeah generals

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:48.330

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:49.920
battlefield that's good

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.120
well what if they broke one of their

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.130
thumbs on top of them I guess you get

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:54.590
what you had to go repair or the uh

01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:56.580

what's his name it was uh he was the

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:11.490
[ __ ] Confederate Calvary I think he

started the Klan kind of see his that he

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.490

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:31.620
think he was also considered very

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:35.280
talented in what a Calvary I think she's

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.460
like KKK other he's a good kick hand

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.780
pretty good though he was actually

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.820
really good at beating the [ __ ] at first

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.050
also I mean don't get me wrong they

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:44.640
always really had it out for the black

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.140

watch sports really ever yeah it's like

01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:15.089
a pressure cooker when someone comes

what's going on yeah it's happening so

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:20.609
you gotta have the game on which I put

01:09:20.609 --> 01:09:22.020
it on its own a sports watcher can

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.240
easily and they'll go to if you're at a

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.069
family party they'll be like why isn't

01:09:26.069 --> 01:09:28.080

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.910
start building a little resistance we're

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:31.680
like you guys put on the Phillies all my

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.940

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:35.520
spazzes right yeah I'll give you that

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.080
especially I can't even imagine what you

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.609
were watching [ __ ] the ancient aliens

01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:41.420
Thanksgiving

01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:45.660

01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:48.060
Southfork and they're like this is a

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:52.680
cartoon Phillies playing a national [ __ ]

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.100

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:56.400
on

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.760
but uh yeah the sports phil has phil has

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.810
control that but the thing that really

01:10:00.810 --> 01:10:04.230
sucks is Phil you know bets on sports

01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:06.210
yeah so let's say Notre Dame is playing

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:08.400

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.110
everything on that need to watch the

01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:12.450
commercials sure game change cuz I don't

01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:14.250
worry we're gonna miss plays cuz Phil

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:15.900
while he's watching they're at a him

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:17.760

film control on the field control in the

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.910
remote during football Saturdays is

01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:32.130
tough and then what really sucks is

01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:34.470
betting people especially only watch NFL

01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:36.750

01:10:38.010 --> 01:10:40.440
everybody's on red zones dick yeah cuz

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.120
mostly its people playing fantasy

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.710
football and [ __ ] but you can't you

01:10:43.710 --> 01:10:45.420
gotta get a full grasp of the game yeah

01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:46.590

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:48.360

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:52.890
yeah see down one two yeah first down

01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:56.430

yard games

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.910

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:03.180
that no I heard that big [ __ ] yeah so

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:04.710
yeah you can't get a good get a grip

01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:06.000
particular grip of the game you get a

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.290
grip of the game if you're watching just

01:11:07.290 --> 01:11:08.190
the highlights I mean you can't

01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:09.300
appreciate the highlights if you're not

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.490
yeah three yards there's no negative

01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:14.030
four yard gains

01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:16.280
[Laughter]

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:19.050
now we're talking sports I mean dude you

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:20.400
want to talk about I'm so excited for

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.650
sports to come back that's another thing

01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:23.910
because that's yeah

01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:25.680
boy the NBA couldn't come back faster

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.470
for this yeah that's dude the CIA might

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:30.390
be involved with the NBA to get them

01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:32.220
started again you think they're gonna

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.500
quell these [ __ ] protests you think

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.300
so nobody goes nobody even goes yeah

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:41.790
marry you like that literally physically

01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:47.400
react to me say that he's like no it's

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.140
true though not that not think they

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.550
would hear like the referee whistle and

01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:51.840
the squeak of the sneaker and everything

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.719
would just drop all these eyes

01:11:53.719 --> 01:11:56.840
most of an taifa I've noticed this yeah

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.630
a lot of white liberal [ __ ] yeah all

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:01.639
got into the NBA the last like five

01:12:01.639 --> 01:12:03.829
years of course has anybody else noticed

01:12:03.829 --> 01:12:05.510
this you're pointing it out to me and

01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:07.699
yes I don't understand what it is but

01:12:07.699 --> 01:12:09.919
somehow they all the dorks have agreed

01:12:09.919 --> 01:12:11.659
that the NBA is the sport in the last

01:12:11.659 --> 01:12:13.669
couple years maybe I'm missing something

01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:15.919
no dude you're right you pointed it out

01:12:15.919 --> 01:12:18.079
to me and I was like you know I look I

01:12:18.079 --> 01:12:19.999
love I love the NBA I always liked it

01:12:19.999 --> 01:12:21.709
but it's weird to see people who have

01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:23.030
literally never liked sports that the

01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:24.530
only thing they talk about now is the

01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:28.099
NBA sure anyway we'll see what you know

01:12:28.099 --> 01:12:29.599
you know I think that would take down an

01:12:29.599 --> 01:12:32.030
tyfa and so you need King James you need

01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:34.159
King James to speak they come back King

01:12:34.159 --> 01:12:36.380
James has spoken and he's very he's a

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:38.539
pretty strong activist but yeah if he's

01:12:38.539 --> 01:12:39.939
you know I'd rather watch him dunk

01:12:39.939 --> 01:12:41.929
you're saying you want the staff go back

01:12:41.929 --> 01:12:43.999
to normal dude then like police violence

01:12:43.999 --> 01:12:45.169
videos yeah you're saying you wanted

01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:46.249
this stuff to go back to normal

01:12:46.249 --> 01:12:47.989
yeah of course all you're saying beg for

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:49.369
normal anything for law and order you

01:12:49.369 --> 01:12:50.510
missed the harmony and you're like what

01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:52.340
would bring everyone together basketball

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.469
it's like it's like in the Philippines

01:12:54.469 --> 01:12:57.169
if Pacquiao fights crime drops to about

01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:59.360
40 percent that day

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.190
just cuz he's fight I don't know hey

01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:02.630
that's not like a real theory I'm just

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:08.139
what what maybe that's true

01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:11.389
what's the robber saying if you put on a

01:13:11.389 --> 01:13:12.920
basketball maybe they'd stop knocking

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:18.380
off we need sports again watching you

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.230
driving down here here's how I really

01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:25.790
that's how I mean it at the end of the

01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:29.980
day you got to distract the masses

01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:32.480
that's it you've gotta go you get a stay

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.309
at Ceasar level the top time dude just

01:13:34.309 --> 01:13:35.900
be like we need to sort of sway these

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.639
masses with a district on the protests

01:13:37.639 --> 01:13:39.770
all of the MBA everybody involved

01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:43.610
antiphon and BLM one of the MBA true you

01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:45.920
break out some tough NBA games we're

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.389
gonna eliminate at least the people that

01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:48.710
are half harder than this there was

01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:50.869
people that are Instagram or stay at

01:13:50.869 --> 01:13:52.429
home to watch the game there's a lot of

01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:53.480
people even at least checking at the

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.710
protest but are you looking at it like

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:02.389
this is a fair point it's a fair point

01:14:02.389 --> 01:14:05.510
I mean also too it is the perfect uh you

01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:08.389
know if you want if it's like the best

01:14:08.389 --> 01:14:10.420
setting for a superhero I mean though

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:13.579
about the live stream before he was like

01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:15.050
you want live stream this I was like I

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:16.849
don't know I think we're probably liable

01:14:16.849 --> 01:14:18.619
for some pretty bad takes considering

01:14:18.619 --> 01:14:21.409
the current climate I think I gotta go

01:14:21.409 --> 01:14:23.719
bad takes in the in the system that was

01:14:23.719 --> 01:14:25.489
one of them we need to be like a rollin

01:14:25.489 --> 01:14:25.820

it's going this car could have [ __ ]

01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:16.400
blown up but in my head I was like I'm

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.140
not giving a loop around 150 [ __ ]

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:18.950
boxes

01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:21.350

yeah I beached up in 24 hour parking so

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.680
I bought it but now that was that that

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.830
was the Oh a civic now I'm in the 2010

01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:29.360
me and Brittany had the same exact car

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.940

backing the same old [ __ ] car but

01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:38.720
anyway sorry so that's not the point of

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.250
what this pastoralist so I know what

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:42.890
you're gonna we're uh yeah yes ground

01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:44.360
house today but we were so we're driving

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.030
you know I'm driving and dude I got so

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:49.220
hung up on my [ __ ] thing I've totally

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:51.200
four oh so this is the whole thing now

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.430
so you know you're talking we're here

01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:55.550
we're talking bullshitting and the whole

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:57.340
idea is now there's a there's you know

01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.420
ecosystem of people online trying to

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:01.520
find little moments of like things that

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.080
are said that are like oh this could be

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.330
construed or like yeah like as if like

01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:06.560
that's like you know everyone's doing

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.700
the thing and then they say something

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:09.860
and it's like here's my essence in life

01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:11.920
force and like this is my genetic code

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:14.390
I've really thought about this more than

01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:17.210
just one second before I said it

01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:19.670
I'm thinking as I'm talking yeah but and

01:16:19.670 --> 01:16:21.110
then it's like you know they get people

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:22.670
who now do a thing where it's like Oh

01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:26.110
what are you worried about free speech

01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:27.250
[Music]

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:30.110
where do you think feminism came from

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:32.030
you [ __ ] [ __ ] like it wouldn't

01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:34.190
have came feminism wouldn't have been a

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:37.280
thing unless people could be like I got

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.350

rules it's awesome but no it gave a

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.290
gateway to just people be like women

01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:49.520
aren't thought they should be on the

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:51.730
battlefield

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.680
this girl has a mohawk someone just

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.860
slaps the phrase you know that first

01:16:57.860 --> 01:16:59.900
person that women should fighting you're

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:01.790

firearm oh that's aren't looking good

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.470
stats are off you continue to take the

01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:12.590
pirate math you're at natural blunder

01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:15.560
one this [ __ ] weight isn't you're

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:18.050
just shifting the pirate map no one's

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:20.660
did since and places have actually as

01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.400
long as I'm closer to the X I'm fine

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.470
I'm Club backs on the map unbelievable

01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:26.680
that you

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.639
well yeah dude it is I thought about

01:17:29.639 --> 01:17:31.230
that today to be like Joey brought real

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:36.179
free speech you try to throw me off my

01:17:36.179 --> 01:17:40.590
game down already about free speech your

01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:43.409
free speech guy yeah free speech well

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:45.150
that's the thing though free speech has

01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:51.150
been pirated by he'll buy a lot of like

01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:53.520
whites like right wing yeah but it's

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:55.380
also the reason we're not like seating a

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:58.079
chick driving to Acme in Azusa rodeo and

01:17:58.079 --> 01:17:59.579
[ __ ] beating the [ __ ] out of her

01:17:59.579 --> 01:18:01.500
the fact that a lady over there could be

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.449
okay guys just hear me out they beg all

01:18:03.449 --> 01:18:04.679
right I could see that rather like

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:06.840
you're [ __ ] just yeah yeah yeah you

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.099
shouldn't be able to get hit for words

01:18:08.099 --> 01:18:09.449
you gotta be able to take the good with

01:18:09.449 --> 01:18:11.400
the bad dude yeah of course sure for

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.840
source but if you go to any other

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.400
country there there has to be the

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.960
equivalent of something like a neo-nazi

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.630
there I'm a dude who's like no no guys

01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:19.349
here's the deal

01:18:19.349 --> 01:18:20.670
we're actually the band told you about

01:18:20.670 --> 01:18:23.150
Spain exactly or even just like Nazis

01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:26.489
yeah dudes are still fascists you didn't

01:18:26.489 --> 01:18:27.690
have Nazis or dudes who even knew what

01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:34.079
Nazis were dude who's like I figured it

01:18:34.079 --> 01:18:35.730
out we're the best yeah whatever you

01:18:35.730 --> 01:18:38.340
have to once it's like it's the fact

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.750
that they're like and free speech is

01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:41.460
contributing to this raised idea of

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:44.039
racism it's like I don't know dude I

01:18:44.039 --> 01:18:46.110
don't think it does yeah I agree I agree

01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:48.360
entirely yeah I don't think it does nor

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.949
do I think you want that guy just being

01:18:49.949 --> 01:18:51.809
like dude it's a stick to here's what

01:18:51.809 --> 01:18:54.989
it's the exact same thing that I I I'm

01:18:54.989 --> 01:18:56.219
speaking for myself you can get it I

01:18:56.219 --> 01:18:58.730
held up on because I hate the people

01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:02.010
that support certain things so much that

01:19:02.010 --> 01:19:04.650
I'll be like now I don't agree with that

01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:06.300
yeah just cuz I don't want them to win

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:08.159
sure it's the same way for the left

01:19:08.159 --> 01:19:10.619
being like well free speech sometimes

01:19:10.619 --> 01:19:12.420
isn't good it's like now you just don't

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.340
want them to be right sure because free

01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:16.530
speech is obviously very important sure

01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:18.960
the same thing no it'll just sit there

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:22.079
like well it leads to Nazis though yeah

01:19:22.079 --> 01:19:24.949
it does it also leads to like aviation

01:19:24.949 --> 01:19:28.050
leave good ideas also non free speech

01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:30.000
leaves the Nazis too you can totally non

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.349
free speech your way and to be in the

01:19:31.349 --> 01:19:33.119
ass you'd also non free speech reigning

01:19:33.119 --> 01:19:35.090
and not being able to not be at us

01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:38.260
if that's even I might have just not

01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:40.719
myself excuse me are you know not being

01:19:40.719 --> 01:19:42.429
able to not be an ass ease like if I

01:19:42.429 --> 01:19:45.159
can't if I cannot cannot I don't know

01:19:45.159 --> 01:19:48.070
either way just a little pictogram for

01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:49.360
you guys I used the wrong thing to I

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.510
said free speech led to aviation so what

01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:57.269
did it's just some stupid I think

01:19:57.599 --> 01:19:59.679
something I believe some guys I should

01:19:59.679 --> 01:20:02.019
fly it some guy believe some guy was

01:20:02.019 --> 01:20:04.710
like a first I'm better you're fired

01:20:04.710 --> 01:20:07.090
stop dropping [ __ ] some guy probably

01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:08.590
said exactly what Kel said there would

01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:11.260
be like you first I was afraid and

01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:13.059
they're like I think I could fly these

01:20:13.059 --> 01:20:17.199
cans let's go usually I was afraid of

01:20:17.199 --> 01:20:18.880
breaking down like what are you saying

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.769
or well what are you saying he's like if

01:20:20.769 --> 01:20:29.050
I can do you read sorry alright hey I

01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:31.059
remember as a kid just walking loving

01:20:31.059 --> 01:20:33.699
that song so much still do still I mean

01:20:33.699 --> 01:20:35.940
it was right when Space Jam came out I

01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:39.820
[ __ ] loved that song yeah anyway but

01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:41.170
yeah definitely the first guy to suggest

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:42.670
flying you see a video of the dude

01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:44.440
people who tried to make flight suits

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.809
like forever there's one and there's a

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:48.280
video and if you're home right now watch

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.570
it cuz it's very funny there's a guy

01:20:49.570 --> 01:20:51.130
just jumps off the Eiffel Tower in front

01:20:51.130 --> 01:20:51.610
of everybody

01:20:51.610 --> 01:20:54.760
my flights literally just kills himself

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.090
because two people like carrying him out

01:20:58.090 --> 01:20:59.800
obviously there's no order it's just

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:04.059
like a mob of people like holy oh he

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:05.980
jumped off like middle of the Eiffel

01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:06.280
Tower

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.590
so I mean high enough ah baby [ __ ] for

01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:10.360
sure you just died he had like a [ __ ]

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.780
blanket attached to his neck I mean

01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:15.579
might be an obvious question but why

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:17.230
didn't he try it off of like maybe I got

01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:20.590
six foot off like a high rock he wasn't

01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:23.289
catching up wind catching velocity at

01:21:23.289 --> 01:21:25.090
trial he had faith in it he was he

01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:26.610
probably tried it off the six feet thing

01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:28.960
honestly you probably had a mind very

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:32.349
similar to yours like I'm probably I'm

01:21:32.349 --> 01:21:34.809
just not catching wind for this I'm at

01:21:34.809 --> 01:21:36.880
risk is you also might have tried it

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.199
without himself in it was like soot

01:21:38.199 --> 01:21:41.949
flies tell me I can even think he would

01:21:41.949 --> 01:21:43.659
have gone for that first put a dummy in

01:21:43.659 --> 01:21:45.760
the suit didn't have any dummies laying

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.519
around back that maybe a stick a heavy

01:21:48.519 --> 01:21:50.920
stick or something yeah you have your

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.340
friend

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:52.840
lift you then lift the stick and bill us

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.940
takes about as heavy as you yeah and

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:56.920
then throw that off in the soup then you

01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:58.330
like yeah but I'm like I'm more like

01:21:58.330 --> 01:21:59.560
part water they probably gave a while

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.820
maybe percent water you see this guy

01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:03.190
exactly had your well we can't use dummy

01:22:03.190 --> 01:22:03.969
I'm mostly water

01:22:03.969 --> 01:22:05.860
all right full frame kind of floats down

01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:07.630
so hey you invited everybody to wait

01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:09.400
like hey everyone watch this [ __ ]

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.940
sick [ __ ] about if it dies what if it

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.679
was like 30th birthdays like for my 30th

01:22:14.679 --> 01:22:16.330
birthday I'm gonna pop out get this I'm

01:22:16.330 --> 01:22:19.060
gonna advise you like also imagine if he

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:21.340
pulled it off dude I know coming down

01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:23.080
landing from the Eiffel Tower just

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.429
getting all the [ __ ] like you know that

01:22:24.429 --> 01:22:27.130
dude flies he has a flying suit yeah I

01:22:27.130 --> 01:22:29.230
mean that is the risk and that's that's

01:22:29.230 --> 01:22:29.949
what I've always said if you're gonna

01:22:29.949 --> 01:22:31.599
kill yourself do something [ __ ] cool

01:22:31.599 --> 01:22:34.360
that if you somehow survived you're a

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:37.060
good life lined up for you true like I

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.679
was always in my mind barrel over

01:22:38.679 --> 01:22:42.280
Niagara Falls you know coming into the

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.199
barrel and go over Niagara Falls see if

01:22:44.199 --> 01:22:45.670
you survive that and if I survive that's

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:49.360
a legend sure suicide case to [ __ ]

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.849
legend absolute legend okay so yeah even

01:22:51.849 --> 01:22:53.469
if you do die yeah exactly and just

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:55.869
[ __ ] die still dying cool instead of

01:22:55.869 --> 01:22:57.989
being a coward because anybody count

01:22:57.989 --> 01:23:01.659
yeah I do well yeah maybe I wonder I do

01:23:01.659 --> 01:23:04.030
when I talk to uh I when I figure out

01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:05.650
tightrope walking and be like I've never

01:23:05.650 --> 01:23:07.150
even done it once I'm gonna walk between

01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:08.770
these two buildings that would be good

01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:10.179
suicide outreach to be like we're just

01:23:10.179 --> 01:23:11.260
trying to get people to do cool stuff

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.580
when they actually eventually do kill

01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.989
themselves yeah instead kill yourself

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:15.400
just do something really [ __ ] risky

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:18.460
power the act yeah ramp off the grand

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:19.810
cannon having never ridden a motorcycle

01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:21.489
in your life yeah if your suicide

01:23:21.489 --> 01:23:23.290
doesn't involve a ramp that is kind of

01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:26.619
shitty yeah that's like the lat I'm not

01:23:26.619 --> 01:23:27.610
one of those people that think suicide

01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:29.170
is like a selfish act I'm not one of

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:30.730
those days yeah but not doing something

01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:33.909
cool when you do exactly that is

01:23:33.909 --> 01:23:35.710
actually slightly selfish if you're

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:38.290
willing to die for nothing true do

01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:40.599
something [ __ ] cool to die yeah oh

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:43.690
yeah stop it on during sense of pain I

01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:46.300
mean the note would be sick Vick I'm so

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:47.800
sorry guys this isn't your fault I just

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.840
need to know how much air I can get yeah

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.300
yeah I think I can get like probably 16

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:53.980
feet of air and I have to find out you

01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:56.290
start your I love you're not proud of

01:23:56.290 --> 01:23:58.520
you all

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.950
how would you yeah how would I to kill

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:02.420
myself before I've already said if I

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:04.130
kill myself before well with me

01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:06.350
motorcycle and I just have two buckets

01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:08.720
of paint red and blue no blue and white

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:11.810
and running the white house dude no but

01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:14.420
again no political statement just like

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.160
how do you die doing it's kind of cool

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.200
yeah that's cool or like a rock song

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.000
it's just like that's cool imagery yeah

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.500
it sucks these days you can't pull that

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:22.040
off

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.510
you think they can hair kated up right

01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:25.040
now I'd be tough to get a bike in there

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.200
I might as well build the ramp at this

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.430
point I'm already it's already a suicide

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:29.870
mission am i if I just see you bill

01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:32.240
dared if you went down did you see the

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.160
black lives matter mural in front of

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.960
White House [ __ ] sick it's like the

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.760
whole street if you rode your motorcycle

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.800
the whole way actually with paint there

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:40.970
might be a bad look cuz you'd probably

01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:42.680
spill a little on the mural I'd be

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.050
careful no I definitely is cuz the

01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:47.090
impact would set the lids off okay I

01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:48.500
wouldn't just be open but I wouldn't

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.090
have live juice but I would have an open

01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:51.200
buckets of paint I'm gonna be cool

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.580
though live juice cuz it would do a

01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:54.740
counter trail spray the trail would be

01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:56.240
sick pretty sick to be like rocket

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.680
League I'd call I'd call them up a

01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.180
whoever is in charge of such murals a

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:01.190
big look man tomorrow I'm gonna fly by

01:25:01.190 --> 01:25:02.410
this thing on a Yamaha

01:25:02.410 --> 01:25:04.640
also can you build me a quarter pipe in

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.450
your lawyer do me a solid here I build

01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:10.040
us they they obviously know my [ __ ]

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.810
deal yeah don't we just build me the

01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:13.940
cages dude if you could ramp into the

01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:15.140
White House how much do you think they

01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:18.110
dirt bikers the way but if what wanted a

01:25:18.110 --> 01:25:21.710
trillion chance you hit Donny just he

01:25:21.710 --> 01:25:27.200
happens to be out walking you dude is a

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.970
summation if he dies via dirt bike dirt

01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:29.870
bike accident

01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:33.760
I knew lived they'd have to let you go

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:36.050
that was really case where people be

01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:38.000
like I'd that ones that's an accident

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.010
that's like that's Cheney sunning accent

01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:42.320
who died caught [ __ ] air ended up

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.790
into the [ __ ] White House got honor

01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:51.020
me son gone under the tires it's a

01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:52.700
street bike dirt bike so obviously can

01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:55.610
do both i sliding 6 ampere Tyrannis dude

01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:59.750
oh damn man yeah i wonder what you'd

01:25:59.750 --> 01:26:01.700
have to first get through weapons most

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:04.550
ominous so you'd have to dirtbike your

01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:06.290
way through weapons most ominous weapons

01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:08.420
most dogs ironically does sound like a

01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:11.270
cool [ __ ] uh repel rapid most that

01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.870
sounds like

01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:13.730
tract whoo tang would release that

01:26:13.730 --> 01:26:15.260
actually kind of it sounds like a Rizzo

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:16.820
line what kind of weapons you think they

01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:22.370
had for like Dominus weapons mm-hmm 100%

01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:24.890
gog Glock 9-millimeter yeah it was

01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:26.810
probably like you know what though they

01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:29.360
probably told him that like in case [ __ ]

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.670
pops off the White House lawns probably

01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:34.790
decked out with like turrets transformer

01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:36.350
yeah like transformer level [ __ ] where

01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:37.700
it's like they probably built [ __ ] where

01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:41.510
like if it goes down they can press the

01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:43.040
bottom me just touch we need to get rid

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:45.080
of the father [ __ ] treasures here in

case treasures right there and try to

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.110
hide it from your vantage you would be

01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:52.640
obsessed with treasure the treasures

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.100
right here you need to learn that true

01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:57.230
true you're right actually that's why I

01:26:57.230 --> 01:26:58.460
bought the map I knew I had something to

01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:01.580

01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:32.250

criminals to by like the way their eyes

01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:40.139
are and you go down there and if they

01:32:40.139 --> 01:32:41.340

little been hearing rumblings of that I

01:34:50.219 --> 01:34:51.510
thought it was acceptable you could like

01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:53.190
come home and spin a yarn they'd be like

01:34:53.190 --> 01:34:55.500
oh yeah John Smith was like a known like

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.690
he would examine he was exaggerated he

01:34:57.690 --> 01:34:59.520
was literally in a new world writing

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:00.989

Pocahontas was like 9 I could be wrong I

01:35:11.099 --> 01:35:12.690
