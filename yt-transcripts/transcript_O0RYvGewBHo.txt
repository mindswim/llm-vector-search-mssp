00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.069
boxing giant so and both of them are

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.569
dumb that's the thing about fighters

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.819

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.620
they're like this big giant [ __ ]

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.720
idiots they get a start they got to lose

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.819
the training camp and do boxing on-site

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.620

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.229
sometimes we're just dudes have like

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.169

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.590
guys are constantly training like that

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.669

just did that kind of in the UFC there

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.590
was just a fight bones Jones verse [ __ ]

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.229
I forget his name I've never heard the

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.180
other guy yeah it was uh

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.760
he was a [ __ ] beast dude who the

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.740
other guy like Jones won right Jones won

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.470
on a decision but it was I thought it

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.690
was pretty clearly three to two the

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.360
other guy yeah one of the judges had it

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.010
for one who's crazy

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.980
for Jones damn yeah they want to get him

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.510
they want to get him yeah he's at him

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.320
against somebody

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.400
yeah caught with like coke or something

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.510
pretty sick it's funny how hard they

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.280
fall apart dude well yeah that's the

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.290
other thing it's like Jones is like 34

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.210
mm-hmm so what I'm worried about Deontay

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.770
Wilder tonight he's getting up there

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.010
yeah it's like 34 and the other guys the

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.810
Gypsy Kings probably 31 but he's also

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.340
six nine so that he's like 58 in normal

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.090
person years

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.470
oh yeah the Kings gonna go down a

placebo effect on it's not it has to be

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.920

there's freeway Rick Ross he was I don't

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.230
know who the inventor was

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.360
but he was he was definitely the guy who

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.519
like lockdown because I was like who the

00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:55.139
[ __ ] is amigos supposed to be playing in

00:17:55.139 --> 00:17:56.760
this cuz it's supposed to be somewhat

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.070
factual mm-hmm and I looked him up and

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.019
nothing like that he looks literally

00:18:01.019 --> 00:18:02.730
nothing like that no it's funny now he

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.070
acts like he's like 50 cent he like

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.419
where it's like cool suits and it's like

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:07.919
all about business and everyone's like

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:10.500
cool he's all about he's that he was

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.510
like yeah he was worth like almost a

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.190
billion dollars from selling crack and

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.620
now he's just he served like 15 years in

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:16.980
prison

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.190
yep you do like speaking towards that's

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.019
what happened to so speaking towards

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:25.320
himself now about like business yeah I'd

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.760
like to be the good businessman it's a

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.529
guy sick it's all about attitude that

00:18:28.529 --> 00:18:30.779
yeah that's he got sentenced to life and

00:18:30.779 --> 00:18:32.429
they're like I will reduce it to like 15

00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:36.019
years yeah I also wonder how and why

00:18:36.019 --> 00:18:39.539
yeah what bagged he secured to get out

00:18:39.539 --> 00:18:40.710
like you probably I mean it was probably

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.799
the CIA and he probably but they would

00:18:43.799 --> 00:18:44.570
have just killed him

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.190
true know that's sure blasting them

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.539
unless you can get some sort of uh

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:50.820
unless you can hold some sort roof I'm

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.909
sure he ratted oh yeah pretty hard rat

00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:55.649
of course or you hold you know a couple

00:18:55.649 --> 00:18:57.240
higher-ups or like well bros a double

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.769
jeopardy you tell me I'll have this [ __ ]

00:18:58.769 --> 00:19:03.750
released yeah it's like a CIA and crack

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.720
in the you know black communities it's

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.809
like somebody's again in fact the guy

00:19:09.809 --> 00:19:12.600
who was worth half a billion or a

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.970
billion dollars from crack sales did

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.269
fifteen years what's going on here

00:19:18.269 --> 00:19:21.360
yeah well it's also what is the 15-year

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.820
thing it's like all kind of weird what

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.399
do you mean why 15 years oh yeah he's

00:19:26.399 --> 00:19:27.330
gonna go to jail forever

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.179
did he kill anybody like probably he

00:19:30.179 --> 00:19:32.639
probably resulted in like wild amount of

00:19:32.639 --> 00:19:35.279
deaths overdoses and stuff yet he was

00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:38.730
the crack epidemic yeah

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.899
well do that's the other thing when

00:19:39.899 --> 00:19:42.029
people compare the opiate opiate

00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:43.350
epidemic with the crack epidemic it's

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.200
like totally [ __ ] different it's like

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.750
doctors give out opiates yeah and the

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.429
crack epidemic definitely took people by

00:19:50.429 --> 00:19:52.139
forest it was apparently like you were

00:19:52.139 --> 00:19:53.460
just smote when it first came out it was

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.580
just like oh sweet yeah narcos they're

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.039
like oh yeah you can just smoke it yeah

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:00.960
characters are like oh cool I'll try

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.350
some cuz they do coke they do

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.299
took the whole time which is almost like

00:20:04.299 --> 00:20:06.520
like madmen are like peaky blinders or

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.570
whatever where they're just chugging

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:09.190
whiskey ol time yeah these dudes are

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.090
doing lines of coke the entire show yeah

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.559
that's I think that's believable those

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:16.120
dudes are that high up but if they're

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.520
not like visibly falling apart like yeah

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.590
Henry Hill is a good example and then

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.929
Goodfellas of a dude who starts doing a

00:20:22.929 --> 00:20:24.280
ton of blower like looking out for

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.309
helicopters these are [ __ ] narcos

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:29.559
like fighting each other and the

00:20:29.559 --> 00:20:31.630
government like they should be like the

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.880
most paranoid people on earth I'm just

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.100
doing coke the whole time yeah it's true

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.809
that's kind of [ __ ] yeah except

00:20:37.809 --> 00:20:39.159
except me ghosts they wouldn't do it

00:20:39.159 --> 00:20:40.870
they wouldn't touch like we don't get

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.860
high on supply baby yeah dude why why do

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.260
they have to make them what like

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.200
untouchable cool even in this you bought

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.080
bothered you mean well it's just own

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.450
crack we're probably cool yeah but then

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.860
there's a there's a scene where they get

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.950
beat up by El Chapo in Mexico and the

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.260
three black dudes just like throw a

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.720
Mexican at him and I like peace out and

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.130
leave they wanna get [ __ ] up like I

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.929

00:21:10.929 --> 00:21:14.260
yeah it's not real at all no it's like

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.110
this weird obsession with like now

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.760

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.010
like they saw rap videos and like this

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.240

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.130
always are it's like no other humans

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.700

watching that and just being able to

00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:16.279
imagine watching [ __ ] PewDiePie

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:17.809
playing like video games then he just

00:25:17.809 --> 00:25:23.360

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.369
of the funniest [ __ ] clips well that

00:25:25.369 --> 00:25:26.720
was as you remember that yeah remember

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.919

already kid that was like rampant true

00:25:35.749 --> 00:25:37.639

00:25:37.639 --> 00:25:38.960
on saying whatever the [ __ ] they wanted

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.730

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.889
those old ways come back and get you

00:25:42.889 --> 00:25:44.629
dude true I know about that you're a

00:25:44.629 --> 00:25:47.600
YouTube star all of a sudden oh [ __ ] I

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.820
[ __ ] it at me there's 2.5 million

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.580
people watching this [ __ ] [ __ ] didn't

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.369
mean to say that yeah man dude I'm

00:25:55.369 --> 00:25:56.629
getting real in it I've been getting

00:25:56.629 --> 00:25:59.299
real into like studying online comments

00:25:59.299 --> 00:26:01.639
I think there's more than meets the eye

00:26:01.639 --> 00:26:04.299
dude yeah I think they are like a weird

00:26:04.299 --> 00:26:06.350
circulatory system that's going on here

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.230
what do you mean just there's like

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.279
there's all these communities and

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:11.809
there's these like comments that build

00:26:11.809 --> 00:26:12.440
around them

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.730
so it's like we have our you know we

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.529
have our subreddit and then there's like

00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:17.179
almost like a weather that like if

00:26:17.179 --> 00:26:18.470
something happens there's like you can

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:19.909
kind of tell what kind of comments are

00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:21.049
gonna come like what function do they

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:23.480
dude 70% of people don't post comments

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.179
at all yeah 70-20-10 makes sense

00:26:26.179 --> 00:26:28.519
20 percent sometimes 10 percent are hard

00:26:28.519 --> 00:26:30.289
commoners so when you see when you're

00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:32.269
dealing with commenters there are only

00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:34.369
10% of Internet users yeah there's a

00:26:34.369 --> 00:26:36.350
couple that just [ __ ] on YouTube

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.179
everyone like I look at the comments and

00:26:38.179 --> 00:26:39.590
there's there's like one dude that just

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.260
non-stop hates helmet

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.570
yeah non-stop no matter what the video

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:45.950
is his comments are in there and he's

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.510
like this guy [ __ ] sucks he's not

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.230
funny at all

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.180
that's alright thanks man well dude

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.210
that's that's 10% of it well 10% of the

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:56.630
viewing population yeah that makes sense

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:57.650
I'm telling you man I think they're

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.140
gonna start being able to sift through

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.700
comments in mass and then being able to

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.800
start putting out like psychological

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.360
profiles and like do like personality

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:05.780
types

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.910

documentary about you

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:10.160
dude they uh I was getting into the like

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.020
the propaganda machine of like the

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.610
upcoming election how it's working now

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:14.560
yeah

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.330
so they apparently Trump had like the

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.090
the biggest digital information campaign

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.790
like that they ever had he did something

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.620
the Obamas did and the Clintons which is

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.600
called micro-targeting we're like now

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.130
you know used to be able to have to go

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.690
to a whole group of people and I come up

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.580
with like [ __ ] to say they like kind of

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.350
appeal to everybody yeah yeah yeah we

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.940
look at the algorithm and appeal

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.920
directly to somebody but just from a

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.320
computer yeah from like on there yeah so

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.820
you can have nine different platforms

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.140
where you can be like I hate abortion

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.610
and you can go out and be like I hate

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:45.200
this and you just you know there's no

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.920
narrative or nothing to it

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.060
but they're saying they do so they're

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.160

negative stuff about you you hire people

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:01.160

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.170
it or just be like there's no way for me

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:28.490
to not look at it but there's another

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:29.630
thing too where it's like all right well

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.250

people that don't like things just do

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.690

still like yeah I still see it but it is

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.350
good if you deep down if you dive into

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.730
the negativity sometimes you can pull

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:48.320
out little jewels or you're like okay

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.150

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.690
in a way that like I don't think we've

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.310

taste campaign they did it was an

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.450
experiment a guy did where they didn't

like local like news yeah and then they

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.320
were just something would happen and

00:36:06.609 --> 00:36:07.960

they're still the dogs out there dude so

00:36:11.619 --> 00:36:14.349
got the toys out there 100% true we'll

00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:16.450
be right but that's all you can do you

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:18.910
there's no national consensus on reality

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.849
it's gone yeah also I got dost pretty

00:36:21.849 --> 00:36:24.820
hard it's not that bad it stinks but

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.680
you'll be all right for sure it's not

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.020
it's it's just a weird wild kind of

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.660
freeing actually true that yeah if you

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.090
watch the debates that's the democratic

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.340

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.160
off like dude who to get Buddha jej

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.020

trying to make friends that's what I

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.080
feel the worst about she's in there

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.610
being like here's something funny I read

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:38.140

hilarious and then to say to a boy

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:49.480
be like give him some [ __ ] you see if

stuff it's [ __ ] funny it's a funny

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:55.180
thing to say that's what I'm talking

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.770
about dude people got to get in on the

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:57.970
core work where it's like what's that

00:44:57.970 --> 00:44:59.950
this lady is this lady fuming over a

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:02.500
fact of like people being trans where

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.780
she like in a room with a bunch of white

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:09.580
people being like oh and the whole thing

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.260
about do they care about the issues it's

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:14.020
like I'm sure some of them but the fact

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.150
that all of them do at the same time all

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:19.360
the time it's a little strange and dudes

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.730
like all the sudden like the let now

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.380
we're now they're all obsessed with

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.600
Bernie now like now they're all that

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.030
it's like I don't know yeah it's weird

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:30.610
super [ __ ] weird it's like there's

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:32.200
[ __ ] that like chaps my ass if someone

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.160
starts talking about it I'm gonna turn

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:36.700
around big huh but if like that was true

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.490
she served up a lob for all these people

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:40.840
would be like nah dude I don't [ __ ]

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.480
around like that and they were just like

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.670
yeah that's so weird oh man I mean

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:47.140
whatever I don't care

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.300
um you know it was just like [ __ ]

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.540
yeah well I think they're more about I

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.850
think I don't think they care about the

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:56.500
issues as much as they care about their

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.810
side winning mm-hmm so they're not

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:00.130
they're not like attached to these

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:01.480
issues that they'll they're not gonna

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.400
die on any Hills for any of this yeah

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.020
they're just like as long as the left

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:08.740
wins yeah sure I don't know no I don't

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:11.590
think they're gonna shut it down dude no

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:14.530
chance it was so funny maybe if that was

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:18.250
a black guy there's a decent chance true

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:19.930
they could have maybe slightly better

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:22.960
chance but no black lady they're not

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.390
they whatever that lady says goes in

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.930
their world

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:27.940
it's so [ __ ] for them to all just

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:28.660
absorb that

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:31.329
and then be like so uh how are your

00:46:31.329 --> 00:46:32.829
classes just move right on well there's

00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:34.119
another thing in that you know this

00:46:34.119 --> 00:46:36.039
isn't this is another great take from me

00:46:36.039 --> 00:46:39.970
but the [ __ ] uh so somebody was like

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:43.240
well it's his kid dude like [ __ ] shut

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.369
up about it so which would be agreed

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.990
like I would agree with that if they

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:50.020
weren't like shoving videos down our

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.700
throats on Twitter like d-wade was

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.190
filming he was in a golf cart with his

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:56.140
kid and his kid was just explaining life

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.059
mm-hmm and they like put it on Twitter

00:46:58.059 --> 00:47:00.819
and it was like trending it was like

00:47:00.819 --> 00:47:03.220
forget the kid's name yeah it's like

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.099
zalaya explains life there's a [ __ ]

00:47:06.099 --> 00:47:08.289
rich twelve-year-old driving a golf cart

00:47:08.289 --> 00:47:11.980
around their compound yeah what was the

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.660
explanation it was like just be yourself

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.130
as soon as you can be yourself you're

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:17.520
free and all this stuff and it's like oh

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.890
this is the revelation that this you

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:23.799
know twelve year old just had yeah I

00:47:23.799 --> 00:47:26.770
don't know also this is though it's like

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:29.589
it is kind of being pushed onto people

00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:31.539
so like yeah if people are gonna sit

00:47:31.539 --> 00:47:33.220
there like Busey is gonna be a planet

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.599
fitness being like don't cut that kid's

00:47:34.599 --> 00:47:36.400
dick off like it's not like he's just

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.500
out of nowhere saying that yeah you know

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.380
true it's been foisted on him well dude

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.059
and they so this is the this is the

00:47:43.059 --> 00:47:45.039
Social Work perspective is person and

00:47:45.039 --> 00:47:47.049
environment select the external forces

00:47:47.049 --> 00:47:49.900
are your inescapable they will shape you

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.670
in some way shape or form so when

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:53.109
they're like you know like poverty is

00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:55.450
external forces the idea for a

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:57.549
twelve-year-old to be trans now now is

00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:59.230
an intrinsic value not something that

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:01.029
you know what I mean there's like what

00:48:01.029 --> 00:48:03.069
do you mean so like well someone in in

00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:04.359
schooling talk about poverty it's like

00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:05.289
yeah but what about like you know

00:48:05.289 --> 00:48:07.059
there's systemic racism there's all

00:48:07.059 --> 00:48:08.319
these factors that come up blah blah

00:48:08.319 --> 00:48:09.880
blah it's like the system we're in which

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.200
I'm like okay I can see that you think

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.450
the family you grow up in shapes you

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:15.520
psychologically so then society that

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.109
families and obviously shapes a family

00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:18.609
which is like for sure it makes sense

00:48:18.609 --> 00:48:21.220
yes but when it comes to trans inge it's

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.380
like so now that we have a culture that

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.089
is more accepting of it does that mean

00:48:25.089 --> 00:48:28.299
people are going to trans more does that

00:48:28.299 --> 00:48:29.589
mean they intrinsically wanted to

00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:30.880
transit that mean they're being affected

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.770
by the culture yeah of course but if you

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:34.180
bring that up they're like [ __ ] piece

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.559
of [ __ ] and it's like yes that's your

00:48:35.559 --> 00:48:35.920
theory

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.510
that's your [ __ ] theory yeah now that

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:40.839
there's one one of Dwayne Wade's kids is

00:48:40.839 --> 00:48:42.880
famous mm-hmm

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.520
there's a reward for transitioning now

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.770
especially as a kid yeah especially when

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:49.900
parents like oh let me let me put this

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.140
on Instagram real look pageant moms bro

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:53.950
you know you don't think and they're

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:55.390
sick and twisted [ __ ] heads they're

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:56.560
gonna be like bro

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.330
Oh what is that oh my it's actually a

00:48:58.330 --> 00:48:59.530
very good point because most of the

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:01.030
pageant moms are usually these [ __ ]

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:03.180
right-wing red states where it's like

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.860
Texas moms they're like oh you look good

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:07.870
out there dance the same thing with a

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:10.330
left the blue state is just like my kid

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:13.480
is gay you know in Texas it's like look

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.480
how hot my daughter looks yeah straight

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.010
my [ __ ] [ __ ] eight year old

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.620
daughter is well done and you know in

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.120
New York it's like my kid is actually

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:28.270
queer you better not let him at the

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:31.060
playground he's gonna stick right off so

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.390
like yeah it's [ __ ] it's nuts because

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:36.010
it's it's there's personality types and

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:37.780
there's personality types within context

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:38.830
so it's like if you're a Texas

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:40.990
Republican you got you're like a pageant

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:42.130
mom but yeah then there's the pageant

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.140
mom you know so it's like oh I think all

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.270
that's [ __ ] [ __ ] have you seen

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:48.400
people in a room long enough and like

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.320
[ __ ] with the food supply all the [ __ ]

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:50.860
melts away

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.870
[ __ ] it's [ __ ] [ __ ] and

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:54.370
people will define themselves by it it's

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:56.380
like dude pick something else pick

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:57.880
something else come on now pick

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.170
something I mean the pageant moms are

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:02.350
good analogy as far as cuz you've seen

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:04.210
it we've we know people in Philly

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:06.910
they're like make sure that you know my

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.400
kid being gender genderless is on

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.700
Instagram on my name yeah dude so what

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.140
are you doing why are you doing it

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.990
exactly what's the real reason there now

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:19.540
you can hide behind answers like my

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:21.520
daughter is beautiful and this is a you

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.990
better accept it and like all that and

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:26.290
like I'm proud it's like I think I think

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:28.900
you like the likes I think you might

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.960
like the likes on this yeah honestly you

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.880
did I agree and it's like we all do that

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.710
it's not lead in like I'm like cuz I do

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:37.420
if I have some [ __ ] that's like doing

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:38.470
really well I'm like [ __ ] yeah this

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:41.560
rules so it's like you're telling me you

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.140
know that's not the case somewhere it's

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.600
like and it's a drastic thing yeah a

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.910
drastic decision to make dude so it's

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.910
like dude people obviously I love ty

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:53.860

possibility of viral Ness

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.170

tinder note shot that's another thing

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:50.200
it's nullifying is it's yeah I

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.609
understand the insel argument against

01:01:51.609 --> 01:01:54.010
online dating it really [ __ ] you if you

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:56.619
have a remote personality yeah a hundred

01:01:56.619 --> 01:01:57.480
percent personnel

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.710
you just looked at a picture maybe like

01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:00.810
oh [ __ ] that guy

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:03.000
well that's where the narrative that's

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.040
where the story you tell but I think so

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.270
I think scenes in cells might have

01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:08.609
garbage personalities so I'm good for

01:02:08.609 --> 01:02:08.970
sure

01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:10.980
but it's like you have to be able to

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.380
craft a narrative about yourself through

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.540
pictures kind of yeah and also nullifies

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.820
being able to actually be funny because

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.410
you have time to think about a response

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:21.210
you gotta fit you know that's the thing

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:22.380
too if you're fun if you get funny

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:24.390
online persona it's like you're you know

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:26.640
it must be a nightmare in person no no

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.170
I'm saying if you can craft like funny

01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:30.570
stuff on these things it's just like oh

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:31.710

01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:34.590
