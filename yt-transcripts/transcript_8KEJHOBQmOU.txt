00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.959
me

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.040
and it said uh it just said vonnegut but

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.040
she spelled vonnegut wrong and i was

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.959
like god my mom's a [ __ ] idiot she

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.239
can't even spell vonnegut right and then

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.239
i went out to like a bj's warehouse type

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.880
thing it went in the firework aisle

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.080
and i had a lighter and i had like a

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.520
couple fireworks and i was like just

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.840
lighting it near the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.880
wick and then all of a sudden they

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.160
brushed one of those big cakes i was

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.520
like [ __ ] i had to take it to the main

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.880
aisle and lay on it and the firework

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.720
exploded and burned up my shirt then i

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.000
had to argue with the manager being like

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.560
dude it was purely [ __ ] static like i

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.600
i touched my i hit my socks then sparked

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.680
static sparks the firework that you laid

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.280
on like a hero

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.600
inside inside of bj's yeah so like and i

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.280
try to tell them like it was a friction

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.639
start dude i [ __ ] rubbed it like a

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.479
matchhead the manager was like [ __ ]

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.240
and i was like nah seriously then like i

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.280
saw the uh the painting again with the

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.560
wrong spelled name and i was just like

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.040
god [ __ ] woke up

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.040
that's the music extremes dude they just

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.720
that you don't forget them yeah there's

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.240
no real interpretation for that one

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.759
that's a tough one that's a tough one to

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:08.800
get to the bottom of i think the

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.199
vonnegut probably comes from me bragging

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.639
about the fact that i got to monograph

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.240
vonnegut's right right behind me right

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.000
now i brag about that every three days

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.160
it was just that was a weird one yeah

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.680
the only dream that i've ever had that

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.320
matters is sleep paralysis really oh

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.600
yeah they're scary ones i think i've

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.120
said it about five times you woke up

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.199
naked fighting oh you don't want to you

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.759

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.440
for the for the listener i had sleep

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.000
paralysis one night that was a

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.199
zequel induced dream was it really yeah

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.880

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.199
another oh no it's mucinex and chantex

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.479

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.479
quit smoking cigarettes or blocks like

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.240
your pleasure receptors so you're just

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.520
totally like nothing kind of really

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.800
brings you pleasure but people end up

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.400

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.200
have kept it in the holster

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.120
pretty much you can just safely safely

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.800
just not talk about monkeys for the rest

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.920
of your life and just kind of have a

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.279
good peaceful life you just got to

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:56.639
ignore them you don't know cookies you

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:57.760
don't know how you shouldn't call them

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.120
that though i'm not saying that i'm

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.399
saying you shouldn't just even talk you

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:01.920

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.920
a little kid's running around no no no

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.959

you shouldn't talk about monkeys

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.920

like even when i see any little kid

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.399

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:16.320
the way they run around and play but you

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.600

four years old and they run and jump

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.519
around

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:08.480
putting your dick in that twitter [ __ ]

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.920
and roseanne was like i'm going all the

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.079

being like holy [ __ ] this is huge for me

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.399

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.079
couple months into the production yeah

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
roseanne yeah that is that should be a

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.279
side that'll be something for like

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:51.760
trump's new doj to investigate but

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.600

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.799
well

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:16.640
that was alleged

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.080
when we asked him about it he was like i

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.200
just had peanut butter and jelly

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.520
sandwiches every day yeah right

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.400
like

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.120
drank

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.039
milk before he drank a gallon of milk

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:26.480
before bed every night yeah he was

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.919
[ __ ] good though he's good at

00:20:27.919 --> 00:20:29.600
football of course he's on [ __ ] he's

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.880
right i don't want to i don't want to

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.960
say he's on roy's i knew a guy who for

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.799
sure had been on steroids i didn't know

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.400
him in high school i met him in college

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.640
and he had been on roids dude like no if

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.960
and or butts about [ __ ] destroy the

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.640
point where like i think if you don't

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.400
take hgh

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.760
your bones don't grow so you need to

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.080
take steroids and human growth hormone

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.080
so your bones can grow to hold them it's

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.520
like you're putting muscle density on

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.799
that's genetically really not supposed

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.640
to be on your body so your skeletal

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.840
system doesn't really handle it so this

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.000
guy wasn't taking the hdh just the roids

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.520
and he was running out he was like like

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.679
a 230 pound linebacker in high school

00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:04.159
just monsters of pure monster dude

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:05.600
running out in the field and his leg

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.799
just broke

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.320
as he was running that's how [ __ ]

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.240
huge he was you think he went to vive

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.720
afterwards

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:20.080
[Laughter]

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.520
that's why people take steroids get that

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.360
like big forehead yeah that's the html

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.039
it's like you sprint out in the [ __ ]

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:26.480
center field with an american flag yeah

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.600
dude

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.320

loves america all right let me take a

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:34.320

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.480
dude yeah hell yeah yo

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.760
here's something that hit me here this

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.760
hit me today at breakfast

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.280
so you know i was looking over my

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.520
discharge papers from [ __ ] vibe from

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.360
vibe so i was looking i'm eating my

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.880
breakfast this morning and i see is that

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.559
what it say it says on the discharge

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:03.440
water vibe down five down

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.679
all right no it was just like my height

00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:07.280
my weight my body temperature and i was

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.640
just kind of like

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.320
that's kind of weird like when i see

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.799
that we're 98.6 degrees i was just kind

00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:14.159
of like that's weird because it's like

00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:15.840
you're 98.6 degrees but if you go

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.600
outside and it's 98 you'd think you'd be

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.360
comfortable but you're just totally

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.760
[ __ ] uncomfortable

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.039
so i was like that was weird that kind

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:26.799
of that hung me up for most of my body

00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:28.880
real quick and put an end to that why i

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.400
mean how you think whatever's wrong with

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.520
you yes

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.200
you you have an explanation for that i

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.520
could find one in five minutes

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.600
i don't think you could hit pause i

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.840
think i think we're secretly 186 degrees

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.440
and we don't know it dude you think

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.720
we're 186 yeah oh no no no no no we're

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.120
true 86 but when it's 86 it's actually

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.919
186 degrees out but we're just relative

00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:51.600
to us we're 86 degrees so we lose the

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.360
whole 86 degree this is this is my

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.200
mental math this morning

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.520
you think naturally we're 86 degrees

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.679
we're 98.6 degrees naturally that's the

00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:00.799
unless you have a few you just said

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:03.440
we're 86 degrees sorry 98.6 okay i take

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.480
it back

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.000
this is some interesting this is a new

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.320
theory that i am i mean think about it

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.600
dude you're 98.6 if it's 98.6 degrees

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.679
out you're wildly uncomfortable why

00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:14.880
after this

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.039
podcast i'm gonna take i'm gonna give

00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:18.640
five minutes and i'll give you the

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.640
answer let's go right now oh yeah okay

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.240
we'll do it afterwards it doesn't matter

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.679
no we'll do it later we'll do it later

00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:24.880
dude i'm just putting that out to people

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.720
explain that that's yeah try to figure

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.159
that out hey

00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:30.240
it's if our body temperature is such

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.919
shouldn't we be comfortable with heat

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:34.640
outside like that you think

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.880
you're telling me hey man and even again

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.640
i was like maybe it's sunlight but in my

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.400
head i'm like no if i like put my heat

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.799
up to 98.6 and blacked out my apartment

00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:45.600
i'm like i'd be uncomfortable as [ __ ]

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.280
that would be a dark spot to inhabit for

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.760
a while this is something so that was my

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.360

00:40:07.359 --> 00:40:08.800
just like

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.400
so much weight of this compacted [ __ ]

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.839
because he only ate meat

00:40:11.839 --> 00:40:14.000

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.000
[ __ ] bothered me so the video game

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.760
with those girls busting those doors out

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.440
doors down dude so

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.560
battlefield

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.560
battlefield 1 yeah

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.680
the

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.319
cover of it was a black dude yeah

00:42:12.319 --> 00:42:14.960
which acceptable yeah

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.960
because black dudes fought it was a guy

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.319
from like the harlem hell fighters or

00:42:18.319 --> 00:42:20.400
whatever yeah that's i'm down with that

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.400
why do you even say that's acceptable

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.640
well because if you're gonna make a

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.240
that's like making a [ __ ] civil war

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.359
game and putting a black guy on the

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:29.359
cover yeah like the number of people

00:42:29.359 --> 00:42:30.720
everybody that fought in it was a white

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.079
guy

00:42:32.079 --> 00:42:33.599
yeah you found like one battalion i

00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:35.440
think we got the union started getting

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.440
black guys towards the end yeah yeah

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.800
yeah but i'm sorry but i know what

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.240
you're saying i know what you're saying

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.440
yeah it's like here's the battle of

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.280
gettysburg and the cover of it's a black

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.800
dude yeah

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.599
yeah

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:47.359
yeah that's interesting yeah put you in

00:42:47.359 --> 00:42:48.560
a weird spot well you're also a

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.079
historian too so that's kind of really

00:42:50.079 --> 00:42:51.680
you [ __ ] argue it

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.800
but yeah

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.720
well dude i mean

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.000
in a way if you think about it it's like

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.119
i mean are they just going to start

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:01.119
convincing over time that like you know

00:43:01.119 --> 00:43:02.400
30 years they just convinced little

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.839
girls like yeah there was a lot of girls

00:43:03.839 --> 00:43:06.000
well that's the weird thing because then

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:06.960
world war

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.400
battlefield comes out with a world war

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.240
ii game yeah and the trailer they

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.400
released for it was a little wacky it

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.800
was just girls the trailer was this

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.200
chick there's apparently this british

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.560
special forces

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.280
chick with like a robotic arm

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.960
yeah and a sniper i didn't know she had

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.040
a robot she had like a hook arm oh

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.319
really yeah i'm sure it was like a one

00:43:28.319 --> 00:43:30.319
in 10 million thing that somebody had

00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:31.680
back then

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.920
but like you look into that the hook arm

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.800
lady from world war one world war ii

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.560
but it's like

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.400
it's just nuts yeah that was pretty well

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.160
she was like i was watching she was

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.839
asking she's kicking down she got shot

00:43:43.839 --> 00:43:46.160
and then pops up and jumps out a window

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.960
yeah yeah it was wild so the now the

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.119
cover of their world war ii game is a

00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:55.599
[ __ ] british lady with a hook arm

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:57.760
and then and then someone's like

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.200
well women fought in world war ii it's

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.200
like yeah most of them were soviet

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.400
snipers and some pilots yeah

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.000
do you know you know the term where the

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.560
term suck it up comes from from your mom

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.160
[ __ ] dude you're gonna you're gonna say

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.839
that to a dude on roy's dude true my bad

00:44:13.839 --> 00:44:15.920
my best holy [ __ ] i was about i almost

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.160
flipped this table [ __ ] i'm so close to

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.440
death

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.440
the uh

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.359
suck it up comes from i think world war

00:44:23.359 --> 00:44:25.119
ii airline pilots because when they that

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:27.119
was when they had those mat like pilots

00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:29.040
you're like the fighter jet pilot sorry

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.880
like the fighter jet jets yeah the world

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.640
war ii jets they had jets back then

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.760
right

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.880
did they

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.800
i'm pretty sure they did world war two

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.880
no when they started fighter jets

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.960
later okay i mean i think there was some

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.480
early this would be like somebody being

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.839
like yeah women fought in world war ii

00:44:43.839 --> 00:44:45.599
they didn't have some jets okay so they

00:44:45.599 --> 00:44:46.800
didn't have them like that the germans

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.240
were getting there whenever they started

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.839
using jets and the guys would like have

00:44:49.839 --> 00:44:52.000
those oxygen masks on like whatever that

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.560
[ __ ] movie's called top gun whatever

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.000
sometimes the altitude would make guys

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.079
throw up so you'd throw up in that mask

00:44:58.079 --> 00:44:59.520
but if you take it off you're so high up

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.359
there

00:45:01.359 --> 00:45:03.040
you gotta suck up your vomit and then

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.960
you can start breathing again oh my god

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.880
how [ __ ] up is that oh my god because

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.480
i was i heard the term sucking up too

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.359
and i'm like that happened they might

00:45:09.359 --> 00:45:10.560
have

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.000
some oxygen in world war ii

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.680
oh either way it comes from whenever

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.440
pilots start to get up so high that like

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.319
you know what i mean yeah so maybe like

00:45:19.319 --> 00:45:21.839
1950 something whatever whatever that's

00:45:21.839 --> 00:45:23.200
where suck it up comes from dude that's

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.119
crazy yeah because i was looking i heard

00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:26.880
sucked up i was watching a lot of boy

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.119
meets world this weekend and i saw they

00:45:29.119 --> 00:45:31.280
were saying you sucked up and i was like

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.280
that's gotta come from some weird sexual

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.200
thing to like just like sucking your

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.720
elder's dick

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.319
or something i don't know well suck it

00:45:38.319 --> 00:45:39.760
up and sucking up to something i know

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.880
they're two different things that's what

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.240
led me to that

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.319
yeah figuring things out but i mean dude

00:45:44.319 --> 00:45:46.160
that's weird the term's sucking up it's

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.040
like where did that come from

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.800
it's probably back when the pope sat on

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.319
a chair with his

00:45:52.319 --> 00:45:53.839
dick hanging out at the bottom that was

00:45:53.839 --> 00:45:55.280
the vision i got of like someone just

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.720
like looking up and just sucking it over

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.920
a person's dick and it's like yo stop

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.680
sucking up dude anyway back to [ __ ]

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.760
world war ii video game where they

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.790
[ __ ] bother me

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:04.240
[Laughter]

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.160
but it's like i mean

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.359
it's just you're right though that it

00:46:07.359 --> 00:46:09.440
gets to a point where

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.280
because people

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.680
i don't know aren't that into history as

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.760
much as they are in video games dude i

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.599
mean you keep putting out video games

00:46:17.599 --> 00:46:19.440
where it's like hey look at this diverse

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.000
team of world war ii fighters yeah it's

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.760
like that's not why are we doing that

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.440
well why though yeah i mean

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.240
it's weird because i've my and i think a

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.760
lot of people's vision of history is

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.599
just like what you can kind of scrap

00:46:33.599 --> 00:46:35.680
from pop culture is that like movies and

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.960
videos exactly have a basic

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.319
understanding of history a little

00:46:38.319 --> 00:46:39.920
because i listen to hardcore history but

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.520
like i have a pretty basic one yeah but

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.880
before that even it was just i've just

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.800
scrapped together stuff i kind of heard

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.720
and saw a movie so it's like

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.160
20 years from now you know people do the

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.599
same thing and they're like no there was

00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:50.800
there's girls yeah you're like where the

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.240
[ __ ] are you d-day remember when all

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.640
those chicks stormed the beaches yeah

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.920
yeah everybody remembers that that's

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.760
weird but uh

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.200
whatever whatever i'm getting all the

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.720
glories of war dude

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.280
no dude that's the white man's burden

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.319
the glory of war

00:47:06.319 --> 00:47:08.480
but yeah that's uh and then like the

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.960
still shot for the trailer is like the

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.839
four british teammates these four people

00:47:13.839 --> 00:47:16.079
and it's like one black dude one chick

00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:18.640
with their arm robo arm yeah and then

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.000
you think they put the robo like the

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.240
robot arm on just to be like yo guys

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.119
this is

00:47:23.119 --> 00:47:24.640
i don't know just to like

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.400
make it more believable

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.640
maybe like we'll give her a robot so

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.160
give him a robot arm so people are

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.200
complaining about that yeah instead but

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.880
i guess it's more it's like a real it's

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:38.960
like an edgy version of what it's like

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.280
[Laughter]

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.319
i'll tell you what pissed me the [ __ ]

00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:52.720
off dude was uh what was the thing i was

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.079

getting in trouble for yelling at a girl

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.079
yeah so there was like the dad from

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:03.520

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.400
jail

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.000

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.319
a different set was inappropriate and

00:48:08.319 --> 00:48:10.000

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.800
times raised his voice but he was being

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.480
like mean to me basically like it was

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.000
not being nice

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.160

now they're saying that me too extends

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.960
towards like

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.119
any mistreatment of women based on their

00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:41.040
perceptions

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.839
that's [ __ ] weird dude no that's true

00:48:43.839 --> 00:48:47.839

you're so sexist get the [ __ ] out of

00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:58.480
here dude now that dude that pissed me

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.839
off so bad women fought in world war ii

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:04.480
end world war one they had robo arms and

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.920
now they're trying to live i mean in a

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.599
society where if they get yelled at they

00:49:07.599 --> 00:49:09.839
they go to the news that's insane man

00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:12.160
that's that's like how the old feminist

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.760
in the 50s like camille paglia was

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.520
trying to like have the right i was

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.599
talking to sput about this just to like

00:49:17.599 --> 00:49:19.119
be able to be without a man's

00:49:19.119 --> 00:49:20.559
supervision in the 50s it was like you

00:49:20.559 --> 00:49:21.599
didn't let your [ __ ] girlfriend walk

00:49:21.599 --> 00:49:22.880
home by yourself it wasn't just some

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.559
thing you're like this is kind of you

00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:25.839
would be like you're like literally

00:49:25.839 --> 00:49:27.440
actively defending off rapists being

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.839
like get out of here

00:49:28.839 --> 00:49:31.839
boys yeah the boys are coming out

00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:33.040
charlie

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.480
behind the bush

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.480
that's a fine

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.680
shame

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.359
they fought for the ability to like let

00:49:39.359 --> 00:49:41.599
us be ourselves and not be we

00:49:41.599 --> 00:49:42.880
i think the lady even said like we're

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.040
fighting for the chance to even be raped

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.480
which is a [ __ ] up thing for this like

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.319
oh my god you've said this a long time

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:49.680
this is when like women burn their brows

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.520
and [ __ ] this is like the first wave of

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.280
feminism and if i

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.880
if that's not her quote if i misquoted

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.000
her

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.440
apologies camille i thought it was a

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.880
rough quote that's fighting for the

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.640
right we're fighting for the right to

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.839
just be on our own you know what i mean

00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:02.960
like we don't we just you know we don't

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.800
want to be like sheltered so much but

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.880
the uh there's a [ __ ] up quote for

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.839
sure

00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:09.599
but if you could imagine you know if

00:50:09.599 --> 00:50:11.040
people kept telling you being like all

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.160
the time like you're gonna get raped out

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.200
there you're gonna get raped out there

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.559
you need us to walk you places you're

00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:16.640
like [ __ ] you yeah that was the

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.880
patriarchy was like the mafia yeah yeah

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.480
back in the 50s you probably when you

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.839
talked locker room talking like yeah i

00:50:21.839 --> 00:50:23.520
like to hold her down in the cornfield

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:27.000
you probably said like

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.440
i'd like to get sneak up on her

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:30.800
yeah that's probably how the boys were

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.720
talking back then dude locker room talk

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.160
[ __ ] six years ago was probably

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.160
brutal locker room that was probably

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.200
nuts

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.559
black people oh my god it was like crazy

00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:41.520
dude

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.079

00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.680
academy yeah he wasn't

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.920
yeah he was an elite officer

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.839
[ __ ] really he went to a school like

00:51:03.839 --> 00:51:06.559
that not not a military academy okay

00:51:06.559 --> 00:51:07.920

00:51:10.319 --> 00:51:12.480
the locker room talk he's been in before

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.160
he's 70 and he's been in the locker room

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.520
that's the thing he played baseball done

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:18.000
through the wars

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.400
that's crazy my grandma she was

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.680
if she felt like that back in the 50s

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.520
somebody would have got it dude

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.480
someone would have been with my

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.760
instincts kicked in though when i was

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.160
picking her up i almost got her

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.160
that's just that's just a male instinct

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.760
if you see a woman down that can't get

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.359
up there's a party that's like i gotta

00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:37.839
get her

00:51:38.559 --> 00:51:40.240
i do uh she's lucky she had that two

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.559
dollar bill that's true

00:51:42.559 --> 00:51:44.240
that was probably her emergency stash to

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.640
fend off highway bandits dude

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.839
every seven-year-old lady probably has

00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:49.280
mad coins on her that was the only way

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.880
to fend off rapists back then i'll give

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.359
you this coin that's exactly right holy

00:51:53.359 --> 00:51:55.680
[ __ ] dude you just cracked the code

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.680
that's an evil thing to do for i'm just

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.200
still stuck on the idea of rapists

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.559
having that voice that old-timey like ah

00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:06.880
look at this broad no one's around huh

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.599

yeah man i'm gonna make you my

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.400
girlfriend

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.079
well that was like the code of hammurabi

00:52:14.079 --> 00:52:15.599
i've hear i hear people quote the quote

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:18.400
of hammurabi like trying on the sjw side

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.760
being it was like he's he had a couple

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.839
quotes that were like about whatever

00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:23.200
about like the the beauty of a

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.200
children's mind but he's also like

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.960
you know if if you

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.559
if you rape

00:52:28.559 --> 00:52:29.760
if you like

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.599
kill someone's prostitute and like

00:52:31.599 --> 00:52:33.119
they'll take one of your eyes out or

00:52:33.119 --> 00:52:34.800
something because they're a slave it's

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.800
like just weird that people quote him on

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.960
like woke up people quote the bible

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.880
the bible's the rule of the bible is if

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.800
you rape someone that's your girlfriend

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.079
in the old testament

00:52:44.079 --> 00:52:45.280
being like you raped someone the

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.720
punishment was that she became your wife

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.800
i swear to god in the old testament

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.400
there was a rule someone was like that

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.160
was like the first set of rules that you

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.359
had figured out like all right so if you

00:52:55.359 --> 00:52:57.599
rape someone ah that's your girlfriend

00:52:57.599 --> 00:52:59.440
forever i'm pretty sure borat wrote the

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.200
old testament

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.090
if you rape she is your wife

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:04.720
[Laughter]

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.000
that was i've ever seen in the old

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.760
testament being like what the [ __ ] kind

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.040
of [ __ ] is that

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.440
that was like hey man

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.200
now he's going down yeah in the [ __ ]

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.480
desert

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.440
you [ __ ]

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.960
attack some [ __ ] now it's yours and you

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.319
gotta deal with that

00:53:18.319 --> 00:53:19.760
for the rest of your life dude now she's

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.440
sitting next to you on the wagon giving

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.200
you advice i mean dude it is like in

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.520
your cart like turn here i mean that

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.119
should have never raped you that's

00:53:27.119 --> 00:53:29.119
mind-meltingly [ __ ] up for this

00:53:29.119 --> 00:53:30.640
current time to like

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.559
to like pass that on and be like well

00:53:32.559 --> 00:53:34.640
that's what they did but that's really

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.000
what like the building that's what we

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.839
started from dude so i think we're doing

00:53:37.839 --> 00:53:38.960
pretty well

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.880
we're doing all right dude

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.319
yeah that's the building blocks dude

00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:44.400
that was that was level one

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.760
level one that wasn't even level i was

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.359
like level like one thousand that was a

00:53:47.359 --> 00:53:51.280
rough level it was a tough one dude

00:53:51.599 --> 00:53:53.920
yeah so quit your [ __ ] and ladies no

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.960
but what's the point of this

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.960
the whole point of that was it was like

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.640
it's weird that whole weird camille

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.240
paglia thing just went down to a [ __ ]

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.920
rabbit hole but

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.280
it's like now like the newest feminist

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.960
now one to like the right to like not be

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.400
yelled at and also just want to be in

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.400
charge of everything and it's like

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.400
oh you're going to get yelled at

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.599
it's just weird to be like highly

00:54:13.599 --> 00:54:14.800
competitive we should be in charge of

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.559
everything and you can't yell at me it's

00:54:16.559 --> 00:54:18.319
like dude what the [ __ ] is going on here

00:54:18.319 --> 00:54:20.000
you can't be agreeable

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.359
yeah this is this is the top level

00:54:23.359 --> 00:54:25.680
of the [ __ ] what's the name of that

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.400
distributed pareto distribution

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.200
top level of the distribution yeah dude

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.520
that is weird to think though be like

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.680
she got oh my god she got yelled at this

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.119
is [ __ ] this is why we need like

00:54:37.119 --> 00:54:38.720
more women in charge of stuff

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.160
i wish they had footage of him yelling

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.520
at it he like grabbed her by the back of

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.880
the arm he's like you [ __ ] [ __ ] shut

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.000
the [ __ ] up

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.520
like stop stepping over my [ __ ] line

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:46.640
[ __ ] like that

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.319
or he's a [ __ ] he might be just nuts

00:54:48.319 --> 00:54:50.079
for sure but still it's like you're

00:54:50.079 --> 00:54:52.000
gonna pay 15 million bucks someone

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.640
yelled at you and you just you think

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.680
i mean one thing if you're getting

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:57.200
[ __ ] weinstein it's like that's

00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.960
[ __ ] horrible yeah now you're getting

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.160
yelled at now that's like now you're

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.920
getting yelled at and putting your

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.680
your name in the same

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.200
yeah that's what bothers me

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.480
as people that are actually going

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:07.599
through pretty

00:55:07.599 --> 00:55:09.359
horrific stuff yeah then you're like

00:55:09.359 --> 00:55:11.200
it's uncomfortable yeah but then you

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.160
point that out to people they're like

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.079
don't you see it's about everything and

00:55:14.079 --> 00:55:15.040
it's like

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.960
nope but two different things dude way

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.960
too different things

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.839
it's like the difference between

00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:21.920
bullying and then like raping a young

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.119
man

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:24.319
it's like wow

00:55:24.319 --> 00:55:26.079
there's a rape heavy episode hey i'm

00:55:26.079 --> 00:55:27.599
just saying dude we're talking tackling

00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:29.680
the issues

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.880
we're off the [ __ ] we're off the

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.160
subject but i'm just saying dude it's

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.079
like that's a weird one

00:55:34.079 --> 00:55:35.200
it is different dude he was like

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.359
brutally teased and a boy who was raped

00:55:37.359 --> 00:55:38.960
there are two different [ __ ] tomatoes

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.720
dude this is wrong but for some reason

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.240
they try to lump girls in together with

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.520
they're all just like if they get yelled

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.200
at raped or butts pinched they're like

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.119
well you know it's all one thing and

00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:48.480
it's like it's weird

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.400
it is weird i think that's a pretty

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.599
common

00:55:51.599 --> 00:55:52.880
i don't think we're breaking new ground

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.880
here hey i mean i think it's pretty

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.200
common but now i'm saying it's dr we're

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.400
not breaking new ground we're going

00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.680
below it now to where it's like now you

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.079
can't yell at girls in a high pressure

00:56:02.079 --> 00:56:03.599
career it's like have you ever tried

00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:05.280

rule that's rule number one don't yell

girls

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:17.520
okay you're only making things worse

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.280
i mean by today's standards though it's

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.119
like anyone with like a kind of an

00:56:21.119 --> 00:56:23.040
unsuccessful rocky relationship can just

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.200
be character assassinated

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.200

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.680
be like oh he was absolutely misogynist

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.359
like there was a guy writer david foster

00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:39.440
wallace got in trouble because he he was

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:40.960

it's great yeah you you uh espoused some

01:00:21.599 --> 01:00:23.359
wild political debate

01:00:23.359 --> 01:00:25.119
political opinions last episode now we

01:00:25.119 --> 01:00:26.880
got the boys fire everyone got fired

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.640
proud boys going everybody will fight

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.280
the [ __ ] up yes well i also my total

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.119
thing was that i'm not so sure that it's

01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:34.559
not a complete

01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:35.680
psyop

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.440
of getting people like back into the

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.520
fold of like conservative republic like

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.400
republicans who's that i mean dude

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.000
imagine if someone was just knowingly

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.119
dropping all these bread crumbs on

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:46.240
purpose to get people to become

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.760
conservatives again

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.119
because in all the q and on things the

01:00:49.119 --> 01:00:50.799
news they share it's all fox news like

01:00:50.799 --> 01:00:52.720
told you told you so

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.839
i think that's the hard thing about

01:00:53.839 --> 01:00:56.160
believing internet conspiracy theories

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.040
because then

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.319
you can just be like maybe this is a

01:00:58.319 --> 01:01:00.400
conspiracy theory too that's why they

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.680
call it the rabbit hole dude when do you

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.280
stop

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.799
there's no there's no way whether you

01:01:04.799 --> 01:01:06.480
want to believe it or not there are

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.160
people out operating outside of the

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.839
rabbit hole [ __ ] around that's

01:01:09.839 --> 01:01:12.000
definitely true but it's like you can go

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.160
too far down do you think you've where

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.599
do you think you're at

01:01:15.599 --> 01:01:18.079
how far down do you think you are

01:01:18.079 --> 01:01:19.920
i'm on the 10th floor dude

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.240
yeah one is just like your average dude

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.760
looks at you and on tweet is like

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.160
whatever i'm on like the 10th floor just

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.640
down there like yeah look at it there's

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.079
there's there's obviously floors below

01:01:30.079 --> 01:01:32.480
me for sure yeah but i don't let it

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.000
interfere with my life but i definitely

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.160
keep it open-minded that's good i stay

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.640
open stay true you're very open

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.160
you just went to a

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.520
political rally on wednesday yeah that

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.760
was weird man that yeah it was dude

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.680
watching him talk was awesome there was

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.799
definitely like when they when it got

01:01:46.799 --> 01:01:48.480
like when people cheered for a certain

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.880
view of politics i just was kind of like

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.400
let's all do this by ourselves guys

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.559
let's [ __ ] do this together i don't

01:01:54.559 --> 01:01:56.960
like that no but again i don't know i'm

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.440
pretty apolitical i don't really

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.559
i just hate people i just don't like

01:02:00.559 --> 01:02:01.920
people being [ __ ] dude that's i think

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.280
that bothers me

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.960
it's a good stance you know it's like

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.400
that's like that's literally like what

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.400
drives my politics it's like god you're

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.359
acting like you're such a but when you

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:11.359
use words like that to describe it like

01:02:11.359 --> 01:02:12.960
[ __ ] what else is it though well it's

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.319
another sexist

01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:17.040
patriarchal remark that's just we need

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.880
to we need to abolish these types of

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.440
words i think that's what's to describe

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.280
something you don't like as you know

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.960

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.040

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.720

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.240
year holy [ __ ] dude but one thing now

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.160
we're talking immigration that made that

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.599
was funny was like

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:51.200
they were like yeah just go to france

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.559
they were they they started plotting

01:07:52.559 --> 01:07:54.720
where they were going to attack

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:57.920
outside of the caliphate yeah and uh

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.920
they were like yeah france they're like

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.599
they're just [ __ ] handing out

01:08:01.599 --> 01:08:03.599
immigration papers like we can just get

01:08:03.599 --> 01:08:04.240
in

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.440
no problem

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.640
and that's the tough thing because it's

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.640
like you wanna there's all those syrians

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.760

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.079
the obviously 99

01:08:12.079 --> 01:08:13.680
probably 99

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:14.960
of these

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.279
that's a wild figure yeah but you know

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:18.560
what i mean the majority of these people

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.839
are just

01:08:19.839 --> 01:08:21.920
innocent people trapped in a [ __ ] war

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.520
zone and it's like the right thing to do

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.920
is to get them out yeah but then you run

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.679
the risk of like if you're gonna let

01:08:27.679 --> 01:08:29.759

roseanne

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.560
i just thought she looked like the lady

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.280
from planet of the apes

01:11:21.679 --> 01:11:23.520

but no i'll never i'll never forgive

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.239
roseanne for the way she treated the

01:11:26.239 --> 01:11:28.320
national anthem all those years back it

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.760
pissed a lot of people off that still

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.679
grinds my characters dude you [ __ ]

01:11:31.679 --> 01:11:33.600
show respect oh dude how about that

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.800
before we get out of here we're going to

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.000
keep this train right

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.800
man uh you see the nfl's policy

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:39.840
they said you're not allowed to kneel

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.600
now that's a little [ __ ] up

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.960
yeah

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.800
then again dude it's like

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.880
it's it's pretty crazy

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.199
it is pretty crazy but it's one of those

01:11:49.199 --> 01:11:50.800
things where they're like

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.239
they can totally do that because it's

01:11:52.239 --> 01:11:54.239
like well we have the freedom to kneel

01:11:54.239 --> 01:11:55.280
and they're like yeah we have the

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.120
freedom to instate a policy in our

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.679
organization i had an interesting

01:11:59.679 --> 01:12:01.760
conversation

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.800
saturday night with a club owner who's

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.040
very very liberal yeah like loved

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.600
hillary [ __ ] hated dontre he's very

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.199
liberal but he uh

01:12:11.199 --> 01:12:13.520
he and i were talking about that the the

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.440
kneeling policy and he's like

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.040
it actually makes sense

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.760
he's like this is a business

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:20.880
they got together and they're like

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.280
what's [ __ ] up business he's like if

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.760
i had a if i had a worker in here

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.159
like one of my hostesses or a waitress

01:12:28.159 --> 01:12:29.760
wearing a black lives matter t-shirt

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.679
yeah i'd be like [ __ ] take that off

01:12:31.679 --> 01:12:33.600
yeah wear it before and after you get to

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.440
work but you're at work right now yeah

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.480
don't [ __ ] worry you can't make

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.080
political statements

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.520
yeah and it's like i mean it'd be the

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.360
same too if some guy walked around all

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.199
[ __ ] trumped out if someone had like

01:12:43.199 --> 01:12:44.640
trump everything on your work you had

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.159
big bro take that [ __ ] off they'd be

01:12:46.159 --> 01:12:47.760
sick if there was a player i mean

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.400
[ __ ] tom brady yeah i'd be sick if

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.480
tom brady had like trump socks on yeah

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.679
but they can wear they can just wear

01:12:53.679 --> 01:12:55.679
whatever they want i'm just saying like

01:12:55.679 --> 01:12:57.280
if someone showed up to it like the

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.560
place you're talking about which is like

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.560
all trumped out like if you're waiting

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.679
and you're just gonna piss half of

01:13:01.679 --> 01:13:02.960
people off well yeah and it's like all

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.960
right you're fired you take the hat off

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.080
that pisses everything you come in with

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.400
a maga hat you're fired yeah exactly

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.040
that's literally how that works yeah but

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.320
which is pretty good he was saying

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.159
though as far as business i do

01:13:14.159 --> 01:13:15.760
understand that and they did give him

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.280
the right to not even come out onto the

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.520
field so you can protest by just not

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.560
being there

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.280
yeah so that's something but i do also

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.239
see the other side which is like

01:13:26.239 --> 01:13:28.800
yeah oh dude [ __ ] kneel if you were

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.400
the one being like yeah that's the thing

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.960
if you were the one being like uh

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.560
yeah you guys can't if you're the ones

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.679
wanting people to kneel and then you're

01:13:35.679 --> 01:13:37.199
like it's banned now you're in your head

01:13:37.199 --> 01:13:39.600
you're just like i knew it dude it's

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.040
it's everywhere they're controlling us

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.880
and it's like

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.040
yeah man i see that side of it too it's

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.440
a shame that it's bad for business yeah

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.840
it's a shame that some [ __ ] morons in

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:50.880
the stands

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.600
[ __ ] this [ __ ]

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.640
get off you [ __ ] overpaid [ __ ] yeah

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.159
it's like dude let him kneel who gives a

01:13:58.159 --> 01:13:59.760
[ __ ] that's the thing if people stop

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.040
giving a [ __ ] about it it would probably

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.920
stop or if it's like dude before every

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.960
mic it's like all right we're gonna let

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.400
these guys talk about politics who are

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.440
kneeling we're gonna give them a minute

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.600
and they can talk about politics like

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.719
tell us what we should do and let them

01:14:10.719 --> 01:14:12.080
do it for like 30 minutes and they gass

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.600
themselves out i'm like all alright now

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.320
let's rise for national anthem so

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.760
the the thing though about the business

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.760
thing where it does get a little hazy is

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.199
then it's like you can censor pretty

01:14:21.199 --> 01:14:22.560
much anyone

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.080
in be like this is a business don't talk

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.440
politics

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.719
yeah don't do anything political yeah so

01:14:28.719 --> 01:14:30.000
that kind of

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.159
you can censor anyone with that with

01:14:32.159 --> 01:14:32.960
that

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.560
precedent being set

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.679
yeah but you're really not allowed to

01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:37.040
get political at work really they'll do

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.000
the same thing to you if you're in a

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
cubicle and you had like if you had like

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.480
a mock wall above your cubicle and like

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.239
build a wall

01:14:44.239 --> 01:14:46.400
i mean that's pretty awesome

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.640
like i hang in there cat with a sparrow

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.280
hanging off the wall

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:54.000
if you have that boarding cubicle dude

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.360
with a nice hat

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.199
get the [ __ ] out of here yeah you really

01:14:59.199 --> 01:15:01.280
can't get too political at your job it's

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:03.360
true but

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.120
this i don't know yeah they're not

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.880
getting too political i mean that's the

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.080
other thing dude they're dropping a knee

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.360
so it's like but then they're like then

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.040
little kids do it in sports and it's

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.679
like so what let people kneel in another

01:15:13.679 --> 01:15:14.880
generation they'll be like yeah that's

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.080
dumb whatever my parents you know what i

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.440
mean kids will rebel and be like yeah

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.960
that's just stupid

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.480
yeah i hear you but again think about

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.640
who owns nfl teams

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.719
yeah rich honkies yeah that's gotta burn

01:15:24.719 --> 01:15:27.120
their [ __ ] guts dude the uh

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.880
but then the the flip side of that is i

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.800
was watching the vice vice did this

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.239
thing on

01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:34.640
college campuses hiring comedians yeah

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.880
and like these three people that like do

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.800
the hiring at this one liberal college i

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.400
forget what it was called but they were

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.080
like yeah we don't we make sure they

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.159
don't say anything that could offend

01:15:44.159 --> 01:15:45.040
anybody

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.040
this is a safe space holy [ __ ] like

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.560
literally saying like this is a safe

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.600
space and then they interviewed the

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.960
students and they're like the real

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.800
world's so hard and tough and like it's

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.480
nice to have a safe space like this this

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.040
is my university this is it it's like so

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.560
they have some communities they have

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.320
come in or like youtube stars that are

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.120
like

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.080
oh

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.120
yeah

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.560
yeah i mean it's

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.480
like watching their version of dave

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.400
rubin that's just up there like here's

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.760
everything you agree with they're like

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.400
ah yeah yeah this is fun it's a weird

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.000
form of entertainment to have people

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.520
just say everything you agree with like

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.960
hand chosen and then just then you're

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.840
just like

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:22.159
yeah funny this is great isn't comedy

01:16:22.159 --> 01:16:23.520
supposed to make you feel uncomfortable

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:24.880
like absolutely not

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.120
that's a weird service dude

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.320
like instead of like humor was the

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.840
masked feeling of people laughing now

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.360
there's like the massive feeling of

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.880
being right with a bunch of people just

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.880
like yeah yeah

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.960
it's crazy

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.560
that's [ __ ] up dude

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.560
yeah it's a new activity now you got to

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.400
watch it
