hi i'm very subconscious about my voice

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.840
just the dog losing his goddamn mind

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.559
i also am like i also don't like being

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:21.039
called

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:24.840
gay because gay implies you're having

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.840
sex

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:33.120

and i am 34 years old

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.640

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:55.840
because i wasn't as pretty as my sister

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.440

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.039

guys holding hands walking down the

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.399

enough kissing just regular

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.240
holding hands on a hot day is so much

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.320

00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:18.720
your acid trip on the river

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.359
yeah i went out on uh yeah on the river

00:46:21.359 --> 00:46:24.079
is it a river or lake or whatever

00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:27.520
yeah nobody knows how was the acid was

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.040
the question i'm not talking about

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.160
bodies of water

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.720
i know you love measurements and [ __ ] an

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.000
inch and a foot and this and

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.119
that a lake or a river

00:46:37.359 --> 00:46:38.960
man i thought i had seen like a river

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.599
before and then

00:46:41.599 --> 00:46:43.839
on acid it is a whole different thing

00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:45.200
you're just out there

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.440
what scares you water really

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.800
deep deep water yeah not a fan

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.319
why do you think that is because it's

00:46:54.319 --> 00:46:56.400
dark and it's deep

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.040
doing acid on the water seems like a

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.560
good idea to you i don't know it was

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.359
sunny out

00:47:01.359 --> 00:47:04.480
and the acid hadn't hit

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.720
for like two hours and then it hit it

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.480
hit really hard and then you're on

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.319
what the one thing that you're scared of

00:47:10.319 --> 00:47:12.319
yeah i'm out there in the middle of it

00:47:12.319 --> 00:47:15.599

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:17.520
best time i've had in a while

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.559
yeah and then i mean second to the sex

00:47:20.559 --> 00:47:22.160
thing that happened the other day which

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.839

let's talk about it how's it been going

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.079
the last two weeks anything new any

01:02:32.079 --> 01:02:33.200
developments

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.839
uh no no so it's just been going steady

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:37.119
so how many times have you guys had a

01:02:37.119 --> 01:02:39.200
threesome since the last time we saw you

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.640
what's your two week average on

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.559
threesomes three or four

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:46.839
wow like two a week this is preposterous

01:02:46.839 --> 01:02:50.000
wow this is absolutely preposterous

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.440
your marriage is going to fail you can't

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.359
do that

01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:56.400
it's against god's code what you're

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.760
doing is wrong it's a sin

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.520
it's probably illegal in texas if we're

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.960
being honest now everybody will be

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.400
pretty pumped on it

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.720
i think it's a i think the marriage was

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.480
going to fail and then that emerges

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.799
right i mean maybe not fail but you keep

01:03:08.799 --> 01:03:10.000
it exciting

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.599
let me ask you this what's the order of

01:03:11.599 --> 01:03:13.440
events in a threesome like that do you

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:13.760
just

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.079
lay down and see what happens and like

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:17.200
or like how does it go

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.880
like what's the first move did they

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.960
start kissing each other do you kiss one

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.680
of them

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.000
uh it depends depends on the night okay

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.599
who's drunkest

01:03:25.599 --> 01:03:27.680
okay so you guys drink a lot and then

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.880
just of course [ __ ] goes you know it's

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.280
funny

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.520
he you look like if like jesus survived

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.000
the crucifixion and then became

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.359
like a bit of a has been

01:03:38.079 --> 01:03:44.799
yeah yeah

01:03:44.799 --> 01:03:48.880
it's true if the nails couldn't hold

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.839
jesus for the cross

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.559
now was your girlfriend nervous about it

01:03:54.559 --> 01:03:56.480
when you told her what happened

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.559
tonight like was she like oh why did you

01:03:58.559 --> 01:04:00.720

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.600
puerto rican

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.920
it's also a dick shaped snack treat that

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.800
goes in your mouth and explodes

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.520
it is homophobic and homoerotic at the

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.159
same time

01:15:18.159 --> 01:15:20.159

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.719
where crystal meth vaporizes into thin

01:15:24.719 --> 01:15:26.480
air anyone can breathe it

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.960

01:22:05.199 --> 01:22:07.520
the battles

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.280
okay and i guess back in the day the

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.639
blacks used to dominate

01:22:10.639 --> 01:22:13.199
the elliott county jail but now the

01:22:13.199 --> 01:22:14.639
homies run that [ __ ] dude

01:22:14.639 --> 01:22:16.639
that's it that's how it goes in l.a

01:22:16.639 --> 01:22:17.760
that's it numbers

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.199
i was lucky i was on the winning so the

01:22:19.199 --> 01:22:22.719
homies gentrified the yellow

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.960
let me just got in there let me ask you

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.560
this if a white guy like me got

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.400
sentenced to a year in there d and i

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.960
dropped the soap on day one minute one

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.440
was this a fantasy you [ __ ] weirdo

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:38.080
isn't it tony he's like tell me what

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.520
would happen to me

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:42.880
if i was in your jail

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.719
they would love you they would love you

01:22:46.719 --> 01:22:48.239
no you would be with the whites and the

01:22:48.239 --> 01:22:49.920
raping thing is kind of over

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.239
i was told that nowadays it's like

01:22:52.239 --> 01:22:54.000
disneyland

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.239
what does that mean it means that all

01:22:56.239 --> 01:22:57.520
the hardcore [ __ ] is over

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.880
you used to be able if you were doing

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.560
more than five years you could get a

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.440
girlfriend or

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.199
they call them girlfriends right but

01:23:03.199 --> 01:23:04.639
what happened is people would come out

01:23:04.639 --> 01:23:06.239
and they'd lose all their respect

01:23:06.239 --> 01:23:08.960
and so that [ __ ] stopped 10-15 years ago

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.239
are you sure they just didn't tell you

01:23:10.239 --> 01:23:11.440
this because they didn't want to rape

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.280
you

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:16.159
