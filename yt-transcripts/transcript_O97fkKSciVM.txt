00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.720
black dildo

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.399
so in my head i was just going through

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:56.320
like all the black videos i'd watch and

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.160
was like no it's not that one no it

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.519
might be that might be not it might be

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:01.279
the substitute music teacher

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:02.880
it might be those two boxers i had to do

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.920
that yeah

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.839
those boxers

00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:07.600
those two boxers had their way with that

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.720
reporter

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.519

00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:13.440
come on uh i can't believe you're joking

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.040
right now dude my [ __ ] brother's in

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.279
cbd rehab for cbd what yeah

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:21.040
this is not a time for laughs was his

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.480
were his joints not inflamed no dude

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.199
so he drives a bus so cbd has

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.440
cbd has a tiny trace amount of thc in it

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.560
because the the hem plant is legal so in

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.279
order to be a legal hemp plant it only

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:41.680
can have i think point three percent thc

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.880
which you know per gram of hemp is three

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.600
milligrams of thc which is enough to

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.120
trigger a drug test

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.800
so it's like you know but if you work if

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.160
you say so you're driving a bus say you

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.120
have [ __ ] shoulder pain you can be

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.560
you could have like your eyes just

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.560
closing on [ __ ] percocets and xanax

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.680
as long as you have a script and you can

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.920
legally drive a bus but if you happen to

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.160
have trace amounts of thc they're like

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.440
you can't do that and he was like dude

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.800

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:18.079
you have to go to a rehab

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:19.920

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.079

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.600
urgent care of rehab and it's like this

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.600

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.959
these things happen come on come on

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:04.400
there just like yo we're getting [ __ ]

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.480

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.760

trying to keep it a little safe now

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:26.319
because like you have to go for one

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.799

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.240
are people who are zooming who are on

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.160
screens so he was like him and like four

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.760
or five other people and then there was

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.600

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.039

i mean dude the dates are anxiety

00:26:58.559 --> 00:26:59.760
provoking we're there and they're when

00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:08.720
levels of anxiety

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.320
a person with autism and putting them on

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.799
camera yeah so they can't be like

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.799

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.960
someone who's autistic in like a public

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.240

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.960
just their parents laughing at them

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.399
because like they say the weirdest [ __ ]

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:24.640

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:29.440
it's good but it does you know it is

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.200
interesting that like

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.399
you are allowed to do that you're

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:33.679
allowed to be like we're gonna film some

00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:35.279

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.360
would be sick though if they got some

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.720
sort of like first family situation

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.600
going on like the like london royalty

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.360
what do you mean just if they establish

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.360
like if somebody's a kingdom yeah like a

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.600
monarch if somebody like links up and

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.279
produces an offspring from the show they

00:30:55.279 --> 00:30:56.320
probably that's like that's like

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.480
monarchy level true that is that one

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.159
dude finds a bae on the show basically

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:02.080
he's already practicing and she will be

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:02.840
my

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.120
queen yeah dude

00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:34.880

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.160
i'm not gonna lie that guy's kind of

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.520

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.520
like i watched that and i was like i

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.880
think this dude i think he's fraudulent

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.160
i think he's in autism for the wrong

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.599
reasons

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:39.040
i think he's just trying to get ahead

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.079
you don't think it's for the love of the

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:41.920
game

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.760
i don't think so at all yeah i think

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.680
he's just seeking fame through tism dude

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.440
like all the other australians right now

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.560
how dare you no that was that was a good

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.240
show i'm gonna watch the whole thing i i

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.000
i'm rooting for man i hope they all i

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.599
hope that show works out and arcs in a

00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:58.720
way where like

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.560
you know it's good for everybody

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.760
especially when you see like the the

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.440
parents man it's like

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.599
just just to have just like

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:07.920
come to grips with that and just be like

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.280
[ __ ] what are we doing right now and

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.800
it's just like i gotta talk about

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.599
spongebob for 25 years

00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:15.040
but dude it's like

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.240
it's like living with a black kid

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.800
just kidding

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.520
uh

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.640
yeah that's

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.079
my favorite part was when i think it's

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.400
my his name's michael right the main kid

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.240
he like responds to his mother like he's

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.160
like he literally sounded like a general

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.000
in the revolutionary war she's like well

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.520
if you don't find someone you want a

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.480
date he's like i will not accept that as

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.839
an answer

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:45.359
i was like yes

00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:47.040

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.720
it's it is sick how they'll like really

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.400
do and again this is why i think i have

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.400
a little bit of autism they'll like pick

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.000
a thing and that's just it that guy

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.200
picked a character that's like a

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.280
revolutionary war general type the other

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.960
guy's a dinosaur expert that dude's a

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.119
