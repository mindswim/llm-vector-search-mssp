00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.279

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.800
i think i might have sold more books in

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.880
here over the overlook is significantly

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.320
more popular i think so i think they're

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.040
so significantly more popular

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.120
fluff it up like call amazon and say

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.880

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.519
this doesn't get out yeah dude yeah

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:36.959
really well a lot of times what they end

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:38.640
up doing is they'll buy a bunch of their

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.000
books so how did they not buy their own

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.600
copy yeah you buy your own cop exactly

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.200
and you put it in the bag so it is

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.440
astonishing that 250 people are that

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.360

suit

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.399

under obama was him wearing a tan suit

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:45.279

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.839

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:53.920
all those guns yeah in mexico

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.399

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:57.560
chapito

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.160
ak-47s and they ended up yeah losing

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.839
them yeah did the zetas get their hands

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:03.680
on him they all did they just killed a

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.079
bunch of people with them and gaddafi

00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:09.200
got hit gaddafi

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:11.600

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.959
they really did him dirty they really

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:14.160
did they let him speak in front of the

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.920
whole u.n like nah dude tell us about

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.600
your [ __ ] little green story he had a

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.880
little green book i tried to read it it

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.959
was unreadable yeah it sucked he was a

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:22.880
little whacked yeah i was like this is

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.320
this guy might be on something is he

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.320
like a pan-african guy did he want

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.920
africa to [ __ ] unite i think so

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.360
probably under his rule which is a sick

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.680
way to be nice i think a little bit but

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.920
i think also his role was basically in

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.839
keeping migrants he was the stop gap for

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:39.920
like european countries italy and greece

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.160
were like paying him off to basically

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.200
stop letting him basically keep did like

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.160
put in detention like the central

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.480
africans trying to come in to uh and

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.720
then he died and you know

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.839
they don't have a guy doing that no

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:57.440
more so he was trying to keep him

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.880
he was trying to keep

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.880
he was the last he was basically mexico

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.320
yeah it was

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.839
mexico

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:07.200
immigrants yeah but um wasn't he

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.639
was it in the [ __ ]

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:10.399
can't get you out of my head guy adam

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:12.160
curtis wasn't he in the adam curtis talk

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.760
or one of them probably about how like

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.680
the us was kind of just using him i mean

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.760
obviously the whole time and he like

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.440
they made him take credit for like a

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.200
terrorist attack or they blamed him they

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.200
just blamed him and he was like okay

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.200
sick and i'll be like yeah i'm the bad

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.920
guy yeah i am powerful yeah and then he

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.839
didn't do it and the u.s knew that and

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:33.279
then they were like

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:34.959
i don't know dude imagine you're killing

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:36.480
dude he was a penny

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.800
what i'm saying

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.720
like your people yeah and they cut

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.360
another country poisons like your entire

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.800
nation's mind against you and then they

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.880
come and you they murder you yeah

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.079
you're chilling you're doing it like

00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:53.920
dude people apparently people loved him

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.000
you know again from what i've seen

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
i don't know maybe he did some bad stuff

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.160
but like he probably did some bad stuff

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.680
but yeah you're in the middle east ruin

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.639
you're doing a couple things yeah you're

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:04.800
gonna [ __ ] around but yeah dude you got

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.160
your whole country gets turned or i

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.519
think there's always they just identify

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.639
people who don't like them they're like

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:10.800

with saddam getting hung

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.360

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.960
our milky thighs slapping dude

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.840
dude

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.520
our vein would be tracing each other's

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.000
veins through our [ __ ] eyes all day

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.080
but how would that age once you get in

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.679
like your 50s like what would you do i

00:20:59.679 --> 00:21:01.280
think the boys keep partying yeah living

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.360
party oh you just find younger boys yeah

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.520
then you you get bank so you can go get

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.280
younger hotter boys and the party never

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.120
yeah you bring them in

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.200

together and pull our money for like to

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.640
get trapped younger hotter boys easily i

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.240
think that's the whole like fire island

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.760
really even money every summer catch

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.400
them

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.919
true yeah

00:21:21.919 --> 00:21:23.600
we'd go rogue on this and really start

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.039
capturing some boys

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:27.600
if there's five of five dudes working

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.320
together we could accomplish a lot and

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.880
we could do a lot 19 dudes did 9 11.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.919
true

00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:36.400
would be funny though to penetrate

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.080
you know no pun intended depend like to

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.480
like go undercover as a hetero guy yeah

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.919
but to see if you could get like the

00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:43.520
full inner workings but you just never

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.039
would put out though inner workings of

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.799
what the homosexual community yeah and

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:48.240
just kind of like just get like i don't

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.960
know if it's like a crime syndicate

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.320
yeah but like to see like what the bro

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.440
downs like

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.960

the [ __ ] that's awesome it's pretty

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.600
[ __ ] up

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.399
yeah

00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:57.760
you could do this

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.039
of course you could you could just go

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.960
down there and just [ __ ] sneak one of

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.559

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.480
were like no we get it pretty bad i was

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.279
like show i was like put kensington ave

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:05.519
up on the [ __ ] screen

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:07.039
this is what philly's like what'd they

00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:09.839
say they're like holy [ __ ] yeah it's

00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:11.440
it's never seen anything like that play

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.879
and it's so bad because it's under the

00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:15.839
[ __ ] train so it's just always dark

00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:18.560
truly hellish there's people outside

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.560
shooting up in broad daylight yeah like

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.879
outside falling out you will see someone

00:34:22.879 --> 00:34:24.240
shooting up when you drive down that

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.919
street yeah so they have needle parks

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:27.520
like they have parks that are just

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.679
people shooting up and cops just sit

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.040
there and they're like what whatever

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.079
yeah it is [ __ ] it's a tragedy yeah

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:36.159
it stinks so real tragedy get better

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.040
guys

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.119
guys stop doing it you [ __ ] idiots

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:40.800
you're making it bad get off the [ __ ]

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.720
start working out you know yeah yeah

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.079
take some magnesium i was talking about

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:46.000
magnesium might really help this brings

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.159
magnesium finally i've been dying dude

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.520
so get this so i've been running

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.280
experiments obviously no i'm i'm still

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.960
at a standstill with my [ __ ] nasal

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.040
cavity i might just have to have them

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.040
like busted open yeah totally bust me

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.960
wide open i told you that i thought i

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.240
did i thought i made games i thought you

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.480
could press this just at night and

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.640
eventually it would i mean dude it's

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.160
it's not bad it's getting better it's

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.240
the exact same

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.400
i mean rewind the tapes go back dude

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.240
how could it have changed

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.440
i don't know i feel like one time they

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.040
told me i had like a

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.720
80 something percent blockage and it

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.760
went down to like 35. maybe you just

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.320
told you it was 35. or i think it went

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.320
down one time because i went to an

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.760
throat guy twice

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.160
you think you had 60 boogers it might

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.760
have been just pick up on it on the

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.359
x-ray might have been buggers you might

00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:35.520
it might have been a ton of boogers

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.240
but dude that's probably medically sound

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.920
yeah

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.680
this is why dude do you ever do a neti

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.480
pot

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.280
yes yeah i started neti pot and i'm like

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.280
i think i could just like irrigate with

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.359
water just like start this is yes this

00:35:49.359 --> 00:35:51.680
is no you can't do that maybe you think

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.839
the water is gonna erode your nose it's

00:35:53.839 --> 00:35:57.119
erodes [ __ ] sand yeah over a [ __ ]

00:35:57.119 --> 00:35:58.560
million years yeah it's a rock this is

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.640
just nasal passage dude one million

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.960
years yeah dude

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.400
dude water's stronger than you think you

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.839
ever think about that

00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:08.000
i believe water is strong dude

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.640
i'm i believe you

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.480
so you're using a neti pot and you think

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.240
it's gonna you know i don't know mighty

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.240
road some of the here's the thing maybe

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.599
i don't know but

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:19.440
it it cleared out so many buggers that i

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.800
in my head i was like i think i gained

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.800
like four percent that's probably true i

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.920
think it was just i think it was just

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.920
boogers to be fair there's probably bugs

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.320
so i'm talking the nose is like you know

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.160
that's at a standstill but here's i can

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.839
report back your nose works out to stay

00:36:31.839 --> 00:36:33.520
so right my nose works at a total sand

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.720
still

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.560
production is halted right i haven't

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.160
been mouth taping though

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.440
so i haven't been out so i have been

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.920
kind of i have been slacking but what

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.599
the [ __ ] are you doing i haven't been

00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:45.200
i'm saying i have not been mouth taping

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.640
and that's you tape your mouth shut at

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.560
night i used to yeah you tape your mouth

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.760
shut you just breathe through your nose

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.200
all right i've talked about this before

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.200
the nose is at a standstill so we can't

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.119
be doing tape so yeah we're going to no

00:36:55.119 --> 00:36:55.839
i just

00:36:55.839 --> 00:36:57.599
i just dude i'm just lazy bro i'm just

00:36:57.599 --> 00:37:00.160
lazy i'm i'm spoiled right now

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.599
you need to breathe you're as hungry as

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:03.520
you used to be hungry experiments on

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.960
your nose and mouth but i've been

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.359
running a nice experiment on magnesium

00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:09.359
i'm sorry to keep cutting you off

00:37:09.359 --> 00:37:11.520
your [ __ ] wife must

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.359
like have you taped your mouth shut at

00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:15.200
night yeah she's down

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.720
if i was getting into bed with someone

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.230
and they were like oh it's bedtime

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.720
[Laughter]

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.040
i would i would be like

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.800
what the [ __ ] have i done i told you i

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.320
would just go

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.599
i would try to talk through the tape

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:28.960
it's like take that the [ __ ] off your

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.160
mouth

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.680
get so much i'm doing an experiment

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.480
but that's at a standstill dude

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.920
magnesium's the real deal okay magnesium

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.200
is

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.280
it is it what do you got going on bro

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.400
you know how he should not be able to

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.800
drink coffee yes there you've seen it i

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.960
see it you do spat can't drink it dude

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.680
up yeah so

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.599
apparently magnesium and there's like so

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:54.880
many different types of magnesium

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.640
there's like uh magnesium citrate which

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.160
makes milk

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.760
i don't know about local magnesium isn't

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.960
that laxative

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.359
magnesium magnesium citrate makes you

00:38:03.359 --> 00:38:06.079
[ __ ] like it'll it it helps you absorb

00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:07.760
water into your intestines so if you

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.160
take magnesium citrate you blow it out

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.920
nice even if you like eat epsom salts

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.920
you'll just [ __ ] everywhere really yeah

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.440
magnesium citrate is for this if you

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.839
want to blow it out i do like getting a

00:38:17.839 --> 00:38:19.839
solid cleanse blow out there dude take

00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:21.200
some magnesium every once in a while i'm

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.440
like i might just go buy

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.000
lax for no reason psycho get laxatives

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.760
and just blow it out yeah

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.680
citrate is like you could

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.440
i'm telling you it's it's nice yeah oh

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.599
dude i love you laughing is that funny

00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:35.359
no it's not funny to me no you you never

00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:37.119
considered getting a hard blow out dude

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:38.720
just for the heck of it i didn't ask you

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.480
i i [ __ ] crave

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.720
some diarrhea when you're done diarrhea

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.640
you're still like

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.880
shaking dude that's the best

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.359
you love that yeah no i have the [ __ ]

00:38:49.359 --> 00:38:51.119
what's the the water up your ass

00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:52.960
spraying the toilet toshi i got the i

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.119
got the bidet and i love i don't even i

00:38:55.119 --> 00:38:57.119
don't i do that's natural the power i

00:38:57.119 --> 00:38:59.119
use the power of water like epsilon salt

00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:01.280
so i keep it going and basically i end

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.680
them on my butt like even when i'm done

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.520
i know that there's more in the chamber

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.960
and then you can really start spraying

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.000
you probably run a couple butt

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.119
experiments

00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:10.640
what me yeah

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.960

i mean not not much really just cleaning

00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:16.560
my butt that's my only experiment i'm

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.880
pretty still rudimentary with my butt

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.040
i'm sorry maybe do a colonic yeah

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.880

and i didn't know about this i was just

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.280

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.560
everyone's like it helps you sleep which

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.920
dude it gives you if you you have to

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.680
take certain types like magnesium by

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.000
glycinate that's what i take take it at

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
nighttime you have like vivid dreams you

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.400

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:08.160
magnesium

need some magnesium well actually you

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.720
don't because you're gonna have more

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.119

that would piss me off that would be so

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.880
annoying dude just watch like like a

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.880
[ __ ] close-up genitalia penetration

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.440
shot i'm just getting cheated on just

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.640
that for like eight hours

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.560
just a guy getting head for like way too

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.000
you want to pour in your head it's bad

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.440
you skip you're like come on yeah that'd

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.520
be terrible that's actually almost worse

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.560
than [ __ ]

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.079
thinking like if your girl just blew a

00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:44.960
guy

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.400
walking in on that

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.760
you liked him that much yeah that would

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.720
work for me

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.599
i'm sorry no totally fine dude

00:41:51.599 --> 00:41:53.359
so

00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:55.200
so apparently what happens is again with

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.000
all the different types of magnesium

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.319
there's certain types of magnesium that

00:42:00.319 --> 00:42:02.000
are like the precursors to like the

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.319
stuff your body needs to make to chill

00:42:04.319 --> 00:42:06.240
you out so like if you're like

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.079
constantly adrenalized you're constantly

00:42:08.079 --> 00:42:09.599
just like burning

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:10.720
you're just constantly just being

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.800
stressed out your body's like it's

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.800
physical materials it's sending to calm

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.200
you down and it uses them up and you

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.760
become depleted and it's hard to relax

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.920
because you don't like the precursors of

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.480
serotonin are my one part of its

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.839
magnesium if you don't have enough

00:42:25.839 --> 00:42:27.520
magnesium you can't make enough

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.359
serotonin in a precursor serotonin is a

00:42:29.359 --> 00:42:30.880
precursor to

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.280
melatonin so it's like if like that's

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.960
why people don't get good sleep and what

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.640
was happening to me is oh wow i'd

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.800
redline myself stress wise

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.800
dude start taking magnesium chillate i

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.079
think shelley whatever it's called

00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:44.960
magnesium by glycinate dude i started

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.560
taking this like months ago i didn't

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.760
even notice so you know i was getting

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.359
good sleep i'm like that's kind of nice

00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:51.599
dude i can drink coffee now like i can

00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:53.680
have a cup of coffee and i'm not spun

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.680
out that's great it's [ __ ] a cup of

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.200
coffee it's great i had one today i

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.079
wouldn't have [ __ ] made it without it

00:42:58.079 --> 00:42:59.839
it does rule dude having a cup of coffee

00:42:59.839 --> 00:43:02.160
and moving in 97 degrees rules best part

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.240
of waking up dude i'm telling you i

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.079
couldn't have it i couldn't have it that

00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:08.640
[ __ ] sucks

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.960
i feel bad for you yeah but dude no it's

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.800
your [ __ ] so it's a little easier yeah

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.560
when it's mine when i always had to move

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.480
for people yep yeah everybody in my

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.079
family big dog yeah yeah they'd be like

00:43:18.079 --> 00:43:20.319
getting shame and i'd get signed up

00:43:20.319 --> 00:43:21.599
every day

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:22.880
every aunt and uncle every [ __ ]

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.119
cousin all that i get into i get into

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:27.119
like going for i got today i was in full

00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:30.160
machine mode of just like no sleep

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.480
and again the the fun of the party i was

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.079
riding that all morning i'm like it is

00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:36.240
always nice to have a hangover that's

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.920
worth it worth it yeah it was fun yeah

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.920
and again when you smoke a lot of weed

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.440
it cuts the hang it cuts the physical

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.119
side it really cuts the kind of bummer

00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:44.880
side of the hangover so i had like a

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.079
headache but i was just sitting there

00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:47.119
being like

00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:48.400
i'm just going to go with this headache

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.079
i woke up and i felt so bad about

00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:51.760
kicking those people out of that you

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.200
should not feel i know i shouldn't it

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.359
was just the anxiety to hang over

00:43:55.359 --> 00:43:57.680
i mean it was a shitty move but

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.640
it was funny it was so funny dude yeah

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.319
it was so if someone did that to me and

00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:04.480
i found out later i mean also i didn't

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.640
want them out of the bar i just wanted

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.400
to have the waitress come over and say

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.560
move away from this section true that's

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.079
all that wasn't your intention but once

00:44:12.079 --> 00:44:13.520
they started the flashlight and like

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.880
getting in the dude's face i was like

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.200
this is [ __ ] great it's pretty funny

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.880
all right yeah i mean that that

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.200
environment but again it's like

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.800
yeah it all depends man that could have

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.119
been a very important night out

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:27.359
it could have been with people walk out

00:44:27.359 --> 00:44:28.880
true he could have been i mean they

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.480
probably were they were up there wearing

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.359
wristbands they were probably with yeah

00:44:33.359 --> 00:44:35.680
i mean dude if i got i don't know yeah i

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.680
guess i guess most people would not see

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.880
the humor but it would have been funny

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.960
if it happened to one of us like if they

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.880
if just randomly they came up to like

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.800
o'connor or gardenia like

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.920
you have to that would have been the

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.079
move you have to go dude inviting people

00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:49.760
to hang out vip and then getting him

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.440
kicked out is the move have him text you

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.480
and just be like what the [ __ ] what'd

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.359
you do

00:44:53.359 --> 00:44:54.800
nothing be like dude they said you

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:55.920
[ __ ]

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.160
they said you grabbed one of these wait

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.000
you didn't just fully [ __ ] yeah dude

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.240
don't worry i got you covered i'm

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.520
they're not gonna press charges i'm

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.359
friends with them but dude what the [ __ ]

00:45:05.359 --> 00:45:07.040
they did you just grabbed the waitress's

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.200
ass you screamed to slur you screamed to

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.180
slur grab the waitress's ass

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.960
[Laughter]

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.560
yeah that'd be [ __ ] up magnesium's

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.319
working for you dude it was crazy that

00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:20.079
was it that was a j i had a cup of

00:45:20.079 --> 00:45:21.920
entire cup it was a small boy but it was

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.040
like

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.400
no problem yeah usually what happens to

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.920
me i drink coffee

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.560
i'm euphoric for a while that's true

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.400
it's the best and then

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.920
i kind of crash and get tired and then i

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.440
go to go to bed that night i get like

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.920
intense like jitteriness like hours

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.760
later now

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.720
i'm sorry magnesium is known for uh if

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.640
you take adderall or coke it kind of for

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.440
the come downs really i might have seen

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.119
that on reddit if you're one of those

00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:48.800
guys yeah it did a little yeah

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.800
magnesium's known as a stimulant like

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:51.599
kind of

00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:53.760
makes a come down not so bad what though

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.280
as you were saying

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.640
so sorry

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.000
yeah when we were taking molly they

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.760
would give us those something it was it

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.520
wasn't gavin

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.599
five http yes

00:46:03.599 --> 00:46:05.040
five htp

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.560
there's a lot of

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.079
stuff we get like there's these things

00:46:08.079 --> 00:46:09.280
that are like that's the thing that like

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.040
geeked me out the most how like because

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.000
what happens they say with

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.079
antidepressants is that you're just

00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:16.240
forcing your body to constantly like be

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.240
like i i don't know if it's like making

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.480
serotonin i think they like inhibit the

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.960
reuptake but you're like your body's

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.119
making more serotonin than usual and it

00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:27.280
like runs out of [ __ ] to make it with so

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.880
it's like you start getting intense

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.480
cravings for carbohydrates and sweets

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.680
because you need the carbohydrates to

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.520
make serotonin that's why so many people

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.119
get so fat

00:46:35.119 --> 00:46:36.880
but you keep but then it keeps pulling

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.400
all these minerals out of your body to

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.760
continue making serotonin you get

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.720
depleted from magnesium so the bros are

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.319
on the [ __ ] i don't like those

00:46:44.319 --> 00:46:46.560
antidepressants me either bro but you're

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.560
probably on them oh yeah freaking yeah

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:51.119
since i was like 15. really yeah go up

00:46:51.119 --> 00:46:53.599

every time i'm around you're very

00:48:19.839 --> 00:48:21.200
cheerful and fun but yeah those are

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.640

yeah brain zabs

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.920

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.400
prescribe them

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.160
the only way they can prescribe them is

teenagers

00:49:18.319 --> 00:49:20.559

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:50.880
a

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.400
it's like a chinese it was like a book

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.440
from china about like

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.520
it's kind of like kind of like buddhism

00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.520
but it's a similar like mystical text

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.200
but the one in the very beginning they

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.240
talk about the only thing that made me

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.680

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.040
they were saying how like women

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.839
basically don't like move past the earth

00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:10.240
like the only dudes can like cultivate

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.760
it's just you you circulate the light

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.119
within your body and eventually you're

00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:15.200
training yourself so what you die you've

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.720
become such an awareness that you can

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.640
enter non-physical space but they're

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.119
