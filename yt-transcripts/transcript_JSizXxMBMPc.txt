00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.320
punching and kicking all you gotta do is

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.539
to go for guys who try to attack it as

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.489
hard as you chew fingernails behind the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.709

fight move like though well it was it

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.709
may be like first grade or younger that

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.690
might be like a real dirt ball thing I

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.280

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.590

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.190

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.080
grown-up sticks or like kid like you're

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.730

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.230
Wranglers hid dicks are too low to the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.709
ground

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:58.489
you had no purchase street legal this is

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.739
just childhood I have plenty of memory I

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.760
don't have a lot of memories from my

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.769
childhood and most of them are kids

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.230
trying to bite adult dicks to [ __ ] with

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.350
them I don't know in what age you're at

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.360
what age I would say I would say first

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.519
grade and younger because by the time it

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.660
is first grade it was like you know

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.549
better you know better don't do that but

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:17.630
before then you're just like this is the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.609
most devastating move I've got against a

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.380
bigger person I don't remember anyone

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.540
trying to bite not naked dick it was

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.640
mostly dead you were just trying to put

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.030
your mouth on denim do you want to win

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.010
or not how badly do you want to win I

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.170
want to win I want to get my way I'd be

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.459
so funny that grocery store trying to

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.320
get a pack of peanut M&Ms is quite your

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.090
daddy cousin I had a cousin used to toe

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.220
grab my bird in the bathtub that was not

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.660
it was me it was me and two of my

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.190
cousins would take a bath together and

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.200
we would be like dude it was the worst

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.329
do the best position was having your

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.739
back to my one cousin because if you

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.420
said if he was facing you he would grab

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.709
your bird he had to [ __ ] long

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:01.340
toenails

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.489
oh dude a bathtub bird grab is a

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:13.280
absolute Russian submarine you guys

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.829
bathing together enough to where like it

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.840
was a it was like one of my problems in

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.310
childhood to like have to take a bath I

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.930
want cousin and knowing usually grab my

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.950
bird underwater he was a pure hunt for

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.500
it

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.210
[Laughter]

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.970
Hunter red cocked over would you ever go

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.010
after his just to add just to keep him

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.860
honest no I didn't do any sort of like

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.090
counter-attacks at all I would have

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.710
screamed for my aunt Biddy's grabbed my

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.620
burn again

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.850
do we stand this birthday in my house

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.700
we're like hey dude it would be like

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.050
three men in a boat it would be my mom

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.460
in the back my sister in the middle and

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.520
me in the front which it seemed looking

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.900
back it seems like there's no reason why

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.890
we shouldn't have just taken three

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.830
separate showers I have one of those

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.990
poor people water heaters like a whole

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.520
day to get your hot water back

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.190
I got [ __ ] I got mr. Tubbs coming out

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.140
to replace my water heater yeah that's

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.670
gonna be an event awesome no big deal

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.500
he's the ultimate ultimate dude actually

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.850
I don't know if the city shut him down

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.470
to Udinese trying times I don't know if

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.720
you're still out the plumb well I think

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.560
you're not allowed to have a

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.000
construction site but I don't think

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.260
there's anything they can do to stop

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.120
residential house calls yeah I think

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.100
it'll they go full lockdown mode yeah I

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.630
think as long as long as it's considered

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.040
an emergency if anybody really wants a

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.930
break balls you could just say that true

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.270
he was also like yo you want to save

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.400
some money you can help me all right

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.810
yeah sure sounds good

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.680
oh yeah that's it that's how to do it

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.700
yeah that's that's uh that's gonna be

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.320
weird I mean unless we go into martial

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.900
lockdown you'll be able to kind of go

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.190
wherever you want it's hard to I think

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.300
that oh sorry go ahead

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.160
no I'm sorry you good I think that's the

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.750
way to do it just you know you don't got

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.940
to go full marshal and just let people

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.500
kind of make up their own minds where

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.450
they want to go and you know wherever

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.610
they're ever their bases okay bays are

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.580
in a tough spot right there at the

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.740
control desk every day is about they hit

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.120
the [ __ ] the button dude they're

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.430
battening down the badges you're you're

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.580
in full voluntary quarantine yes I'm not

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.500
playing any games I've been completely

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.030
locked down right now you have a newborn

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.560
though you're taking it seriously yeah

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.670
that's the only thing honestly if I

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.650
didn't have that I would I would you

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.510
know I'd purposely go get it and to give

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.770
it to both of us just so we didn't have

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.620
it but right now I am legitimately

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.070
nervous about that because it's like hey

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.780
I just wanted my baby to be sick at all

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.430
no I was like dude if the hospitals

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.080
actually do get crowded I'm like [ __ ]

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.880
dude I'd feel like such a [ __ ]

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.680
yeah and again of course it would be

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.790
like the one place I

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.360

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.990
making a big deal about something on the

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.400
news I can tell it's not real life

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.200

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.660

heard like the second hand apparently

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.350
he's just really mad at Italians right

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.760
now

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.180
what'd they do um I can't remember my

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.950
sister told me about it and I was I was

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.990
laughing so hard at his reactions he was

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.170
saying something about like the the

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.060
Italians botched their response and now

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.070
he's like paying the price well I I

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.720
almost agree with him I think they botch

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.320
heed their response oh I agree Italians

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.400
the reason we got to do all this

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.340
[ __ ] yeah they're all hugging and

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.040
kissing each other like [ __ ] although

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.540
they have had plastic on their couches

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.519
for like four centuries

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:03.610
I heard the president of Italy

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:07.129
downgraded them to one cheek kiss and

00:11:07.129 --> 00:11:08.749
that's pretty serious that never happens

00:11:08.749 --> 00:11:10.550
until you Italians you know we hug for

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:16.730
like nine seconds amen God doesn't like

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.740
that they have to stop licking gravy off

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.420
each other's fingers kissing their

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.529
fingers and raising you gotta get a

00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:32.360
[ __ ] drone to stir the gravy yeah man

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.339
there that is a good theory on why I

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:37.670
said Italy so hard yeah too affectionate

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.800
yeah man being weird about it

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.129
mmm classic hands five feet away

00:11:43.129 --> 00:11:45.589
handshake like this mmm that's why we're

00:11:45.589 --> 00:11:47.509
gonna be okay yeah wonder if there's any

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:51.649
Italian wet markets I think so yeah I

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:53.360
think they got a lot of that stuff they

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.749
just come up and put food in your mouth

00:11:55.749 --> 00:11:58.790
they're very pushy about it yeah the

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:05.629
coronavirus came from a gabagool that's

00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:19.910
actually an Italian cartoon that's not a

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.220
plane you can't put this virus doesn't

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.990
know any disease if there's no borders

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:31.100
its capital its Kappa Kovac 19 flavor

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.720
this all the Italians might be the

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.079
funniest resaw so [ __ ] funny I mean I

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:39.519
I admire it because that's like that's a

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:41.809
harder Road that's it that's a higher

00:12:41.809 --> 00:12:44.569
difficulty than Asian racism to go to go

00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:46.869
Italian when Asian is on the table

00:12:46.869 --> 00:12:53.449
Italian racism is a fine cigar as for

00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:55.579
refined taste that's not that's not a

00:12:55.579 --> 00:12:57.529
[ __ ] truckstop sandwich that's a

00:12:57.529 --> 00:13:00.199

track jackets really at half-mast it's

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:28.819

pinchers dude this is their apocalypse

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.490
yeah Italy it's so weird Italy out of

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.649
nowhere just got crushed yeah I guess

00:13:39.649 --> 00:13:41.120
like it's kind of like small and like

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.850
probably pretty densely populated but

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.009
yeah you're I don't know I'm a [ __ ] I

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:47.779
will I will say that first right up

00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:49.370
front but aren't European countries

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.230
mostly like pretty small so they can

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.519
only grow so much and then everyone's

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:53.809
kind of jammed in together if I could

00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:55.999
take the train everywhere yeah yeah I

00:13:55.999 --> 00:13:59.209

00:13:59.209 --> 00:14:00.619
don't have the beautiful rolling hills

00:14:00.619 --> 00:14:02.600

00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:19.009
yeah throw an boot in the ocean it's

00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:19.549
over

00:14:19.549 --> 00:14:21.049
well Greeks are close enough so they'll

00:14:21.049 --> 00:14:22.850
probably absorb them I'm surprised the

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.769
Greeks had an all day like I have the

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:27.350
worst luck I think out of anybody yeah

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:28.970
Rhys the Greeks haven't like gone down

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:32.179
hard well I mean they are a leisurely

00:14:32.179 --> 00:14:34.100
bunch so it's like yeah you're coming

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.480

[ __ ] just grab something and act like

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:41.089
you're working that's true yeah the

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.290
Greeks are probably saved from that day

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.249
you can only spend so much time on

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:45.049
beaches and white linen pants before

00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:46.279

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:47.959
[ __ ] boys Damone video for an entire

00:14:47.959 --> 00:14:49.939
country yeah you seen the Acropolis

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:54.369
tobacco comes in will get around the way

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.019
yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of

00:14:57.019 --> 00:14:59.809
talk it hasn't hit Africa that hard or

00:14:59.809 --> 00:15:01.970
Mexico and people shane claims that it's

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.410
because they just don't take they don't

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:10.480
take stats they're not checking for the

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:16.189
same things they don't have math yet he

00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:17.689
thinks are not taking the stats as hard

00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:19.220
I I think it's cause it's a warmer

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.930
climate and apparently the krona fire

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.839
sokovia doesn't like hot climates sounds

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.310
like conjecture that sounds a lot like

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.160
speculation but hey yeah that's true

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.810
that is true well how this is the

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.520

and then it's alternating between squats

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.320

wall on a serious note though I think

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.140
you do have to give yourselves yourself

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.819
at least like three months of an

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:15.709
adaptation period before you could

00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:16.850
really start to criticize yourself

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:20.020
because it's such a shocking event

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.760
it's insane dude it's the most insane

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.600
thing in the world cuz it's like it's

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.580
she was pregnant I'm like alright I got

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.230

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.779
[ __ ] in like a really good way but it's

00:17:34.779 --> 00:17:36.279
just it's missoura and then the

00:17:36.279 --> 00:17:37.720
permanency of it it's just kind of the

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.019
permanence is just like oh wow okay this

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:42.820
is this is a forever thing like this is

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.860

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.529
yeah like [ __ ] yes well it's kind of

00:17:47.529 --> 00:17:49.960
cool it away but it's like [ __ ] do you

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.370
feel comfortable enough taking care of

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.840
the baby on your own or do you still

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.960
feel like it dependence upon Brittany uh

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.179
I feel well she's still breastfeeding so

00:17:58.179 --> 00:17:59.919
it's like I feel comfortable as long as

00:17:59.919 --> 00:18:01.269
it's within that within like a two-hour

00:18:01.269 --> 00:18:04.149

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.799
been kind of like she's definitely been

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:11.320
the like I feel like one of those like

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.760
Asian kids that there's moms just

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.139
smacking their fingers of the bamboo

00:18:38.139 --> 00:18:39.730
share the YouTube channel at one point

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:40.929
but I don't think there's anyone getting

00:18:40.929 --> 00:18:41.769
it don't worry about it

00:18:41.769 --> 00:18:43.690
that's not true I don't it'll be very

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.200
distracting the uh yeah I don't know

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.450
honestly I've heard it gets easier as

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.279
they kind of become more sentient like

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:52.840
as they kind of said like she's she's

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.279
starting to like look at me now a little

00:18:54.279 --> 00:18:56.139
more I can kind of capture her attention

00:18:56.139 --> 00:18:59.100
she's only like two and a half

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.169
20 days older so 18 days old brand-new

00:19:02.169 --> 00:19:04.600
brand spanking new so I'm catching

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.639
myself rushing like I want her to start

00:19:06.639 --> 00:19:08.289
crawling around and moving oh there is

00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:11.500

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.019
moving they're crawling it close to a

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:16.090
year I don't know I'm day by day I have

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.100
no clue someone I heard someone say

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.210
their baby started crawling at five

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.490
months miami which i think is pretty

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.460
quick I don't I I can't remember but

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.380
it'll be three next month dude did you

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.480
did you see I shared it on Twitter but

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.639
she Kristen Schaal tweeted something

00:19:30.639 --> 00:19:33.720
like I need I need to find a way to

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.029
cheer up yesterday my two-year-old told

00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:39.429
me that she was scared I did see that

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:41.740
what the do you know how because she

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.130
looked like [ __ ] Roger Ebert

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.179
[Laughter]

00:19:46.179 --> 00:19:50.860
Roger Schieber how wild you have to be

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.260
to to make a two-year-old say they're

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.960
scared yeah and that's it was it would

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.090
be from her she would be at fault you

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.730
it's hard to scare a two-year-old on

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.200
purpose because they had they don't know

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.710
what fear is yeah I mean emotion is

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.389
supposed to flow only upward in the

00:20:07.389 --> 00:20:08.889
family you had supposed to let your

00:20:08.889 --> 00:20:10.539
emotions flow down to your kids so it's

00:20:10.539 --> 00:20:13.120
like true you can't be like oh my god

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.740
then watch do you understand what's

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:15.880
going on let me explain that she

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.440
probably breaks the news down for her in

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.750
two-year-old terms yeah you you have to

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.659
be to to frighten a two-year-old you

00:20:22.659 --> 00:20:24.250
have to be doing like the Roger Rabbit

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.940
head on fire loop around just screaming

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.590
at the top of your lungs otherwise they

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.299
had no idea that something as opposed

00:20:31.299 --> 00:20:32.710
she's probably putting headphones on the

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.389
baby while it sleeps and like blasting

00:20:34.389 --> 00:20:38.309
like NPR news like [ __ ] Marty McFly

00:20:38.309 --> 00:20:40.990
I'm I imagine she's just like sitting in

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.460
like a breakfast nook against the window

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.860
just screaming hysterically crying and

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.320
the baby's like frozen completely just

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.000
had no idea what's going on yes you try

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.250
screaming at her TV and being like oh my

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.570
god oh my god

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.519
whatever her name is like rosemary can

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:56.529
you believe Trump [ __ ] did this Trump

00:20:56.529 --> 00:20:59.039
do this to us

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.980
he was on fire today you watched his

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.230
press conference yeah he was [ __ ]

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.970
putting on a clinic dude that was very

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.710
funny to watch yeah that was that was

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:10.539
[ __ ] eight-mile can't stay mad at him

00:21:10.539 --> 00:21:13.360
no I mean also and this would be for any

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.990
president it is almost disconcerting to

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.600
see a level of national crybaby ISM of

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.940
grown adults being like why doesn't

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.409
everyone have a test kit it's like well

00:21:23.409 --> 00:21:25.179
it's an unprecedent it kind of pandemic

00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:27.190
yeah the disease itself is kind of like

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.870
it's straight but I could be getting

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.100
this wrong but it's like straight

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.269
animal-to-human

00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:32.529
which is like there's not a lot of

00:21:32.529 --> 00:21:33.880
research on that usually it kind of goes

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.230
back and forth I could be getting that

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.120
wrong that's what I thought I heard dude

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.039
atah is my favorite genre of porn by the

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:43.299

fat [ __ ] route he kind of looks like

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.690
Anthony Weiner I'd be interested in you

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.580

I'll find her I mean he's instantly been

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.740
identified in the comments I guarantee

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.960
that sounds like Scorpio like that thing

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.210
kid

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.770

he's got a fat [ __ ] unit dude it's

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.450
kind of I mean what across the bay of

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.130
across little crowds lawyers that deal

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.300
with that in the future we're gonna have

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.250
the chat figured out we're gonna chat

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.080
figure out so that we can we don't have

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.820
to wonder well the nice way to do it is

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.260
like at the end for the wrap-up you

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.300
could spend 10 minutes but yeah if you

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.460
do it now you'll get it yeah weeds

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.980
you'll get so [ __ ] thrown for get

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.200
thrown for a loop the but yeah man

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.560
Anthony Weiner I mean dude it that's a

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.270
hold of it's hard I think to even

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.100
imagine what goes on in the minds of

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.790
those guys like high-level politicians I

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:26.190
would say mostly except for trey Gowdy

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.940
he's a patriot

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.360
have I think of like a heavy narcissist

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.750
bent of like it's just generally cheesy

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.220
shows on Fox like

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.460
like Empire and all the shows like that

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.900
we're just like it the whole shows about

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.059
amassing power and like everyone trying

00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:43.289
to like [ __ ] each other that's like a

00:28:43.289 --> 00:28:45.480
whole genre of show I think it's written

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.610
by like it's just like a narcissistic

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.100
fantasy of being like for sure about it

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.020
if you come near me I'll tell everyone

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.169
in your secret and shame you what is the

00:28:55.169 --> 00:28:56.520
same thing it's like as soon as you get

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.440
famous or as like an athlete

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.150
that's when they they'll have

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:01.860
photographic evidence of you doing all

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.510
the same [ __ ] but at like a night like a

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:07.020
club and people were like hey he's at it

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.000
again and then when politicians do it so

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.010
whoa dude you were sued every day you

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.440
can't [ __ ] pour champagne on titties

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.559
stop it I mean it dude it that's the

00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:18.990
point of like that there's nobody taking

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.880
that job who's not trying to just be a

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.530
total [ __ ] freakin that's the entire

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.539
point of power power is invented so that

00:29:24.539 --> 00:29:27.750
you could lock down [ __ ] yeah the whole

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.309
point of it is to put it on like a goat

00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:32.159
mask and just [ __ ] drink blood yeah

00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:34.140
butthole screamed into OH

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.610
like humans humans figured out pretty

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.640
quickly how to like eat every day and

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.710
not die and then they were just like

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.659
well now we got all this I got a I got a

00:29:42.659 --> 00:29:44.909
start choosing [ __ ] and I have to have

00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:46.710
all of it and no one else is allowed to

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:48.809
have any just imagine getting to a point

00:29:48.809 --> 00:29:50.820
where like just coming doesn't do it for

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.020
you you essentially got to become like a

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:57.480
sexual one-man band dude [ __ ] playing

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.000
the machine for me well it's just a

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.730
mindset of like if you don't learn if

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.289
you're not socialized in a way where you

00:30:04.289 --> 00:30:05.640
can get along with people to make them

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.770
want to hang out with you I think people

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:08.909
go on another route where they're like

00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:09.990
well I can figure out how to make people

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:14.130
have to that just becomes your life and

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.510
how you operate you're going back to the

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.419
in cells you you just like he's the the

00:30:18.419 --> 00:30:20.760
P uae's that's oh that's where you're

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.740
heading right now cuz power powers

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.480
reserved for like almost nobody ever

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.140
percentage-wise

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.870
yeah you'd almost nobody gets power ever

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.520
so then other people start like trying

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.620
to like manipulate like social norms or

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.080
I they think they're like manipulating

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.630
pheromones and [ __ ] like with a hat or

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.760
whatever I mean that works obviously I

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.590
was just gonna say meh can you please

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.720
explain a pheromone manipulation to us

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.890
because I know you know something about

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:45.659
it you probably know for a while he's

00:30:45.659 --> 00:30:47.350
don't wear deodorant bro

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:49.220
don't worry do de I didn't wear

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.660

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.370
I lost my deodorant couldn't find it and

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.080
I just started wearing it again very

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.330
recently 2010 Matt like my new things

00:30:56.330 --> 00:31:00.710
pheromone manipulation so is that the

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.230
Indian game playing all the way along

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.670
for sure it's just trying to dominate

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:49.980
especially during this these troubling

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.510
times the crowds would have to be X six

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.970
feet from each other jerking off that's

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:55.320
that's almost worse than everyone being

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.630
like bunched together that was one of

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.100
the things that that I always finished

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.540
think about watching gang bangs and

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.130
there's one it's purse went specifically

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.690
to remember a porn star named Houston

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:07.110
she did the Houston 500 like her said

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.290
the gang record and her porno was almost

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.760
a documentary because they were showing

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.410
the making of it and there were all

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:14.940
these dudes it was like waiting in a

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.190
[ __ ] a quarter north bank line we're

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.750
like dudes like waiting in lines just

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:19.890
for their turn they get up to it to be

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.210
one of the five that can have a shot at

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:24.510
her man wait the five or five hundred it

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:25.980
well she was shooting for five hundred

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.780
but I mean in in one sitting she can

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.340
have five guys there and then there was

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.720
a certain allotment of time that they

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.400
were allowed to stay there and if he

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.330
didn't get you to take away he didn't

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:34.940
get your dick wet I mean it was a

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.680
somebody em so if somebody was like

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.600
[ __ ] Hagen in front of you you might

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.600
not do that's a another weird world of

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.430
fears this one like turn back in the day

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:46.500
she was on there yeah I think we she was

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.750
about to to set the record she went on

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.880
there to kind of drum up some publicity

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.100
for it but the thing that that I found

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.080
most disturbing was the guys waiting in

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.970
line like do you make small talk with

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:59.850

lifetime top one of my top favorite

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.340
sites ever and there's a there's a

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.690
compilation video in there this dude

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.730
named Koren and it was just a [ __ ]

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.630
weird fat dude who showed up to

gangbangs all the time and he like they

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.170
had like behind the scenes videos of him

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:21.990

I started doing a so I'm trying I've

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.780
been trying to sculpt my ideal day for

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.640

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:10.460
like I get close I fall off I get close

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:14.060

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:16.640
lockdown now or you know the the urged

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.619
lockdown the death straight like this is

00:53:18.619 --> 00:53:20.720
the - I'm just gonna brisket in peace

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.680
for the next couple days

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.600
that'll be tight yeah and I I mean

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.950
waking up in the morning the biggest

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:26.810
battle right now I'm working on is my

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:27.980
cell phone and first thing in the

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.170
morning yeah I beat it I beat it today I

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.420
woke up and I just looked at it went

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:37.310
nope and I did my meditation every so

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:38.869
often I'll do a deep dive in the morning

00:53:38.869 --> 00:53:40.520
like early and I've been doing

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.230
meditation journals right after I do

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:44.720
that so I instead of doing my cell phone

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.040
I go down in the morning do a meditation

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.020
quick meditation journal on you know I

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.390
record it do all that stuff and so I'm

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:51.950
gonna build up like I try to build like

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:53.240
a hundred of these things and just start

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.640
putting them out Matt could you send me

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.350
like like a template for that like you

00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:58.730
do the meditation separate from the

00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:00.830
meditation journal yeah I'll do them

00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:03.410
I'll do like it and this has been my the

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.720
trouble of it now I was like you have a

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.609
kind of cool ideas that come to you and

00:54:07.609 --> 00:54:09.050
then you're like [ __ ] I want to stop

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:11.060
right now and record but it's like I've

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.980
been disciplining myself to make it

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.770
through the 20 minutes the little mantra

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:17.090
I have developed there doing this is

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:18.710
like it's all inside of you dude it's

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:20.540
all there if it becomes even if you lose

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:22.400
it it's coming back and all the stuffs

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.810
inside of you so there's no reason to be

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:25.520
kind of like even before you do a

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.630
podcast like excuse me like dude you're

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:34.540
on video all Purps inside of you yo

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:36.740
even when I'm gonna do a podcast and I'm

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:39.170
like [ __ ] man am I gonna things I

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:40.940
wouldn't talk about I just let I'd check

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.560
all that [ __ ] out I'm like it's all in

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.570
you dude you just gotta press play and

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:45.830
get out of your own way it's a great

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:47.480
approach dude yeah man it's been nice

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:49.490
but the meditation journals are the

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:51.950
funny they're so fun to do especially

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:53.900
when you like coming out today I just

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:55.369
did a regular meditation came out of it

00:54:55.369 --> 00:54:56.600
started talking when you come out of the

00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.460
deep dive and you start you press play

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:00.410
so I recording yourself talking it is so

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:02.210
[ __ ] fun how long do you typically

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:05.030
record for 20 minutes okay I'll meditate

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:06.710
for 20 minutes and record for about

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:08.590
we're like until my dogs interrupt

00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:10.780
like that happens kind of all start

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:13.180
crying to go out oh my god so when you

00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:15.520
do the journal is it like a continuation

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:18.130
of the meditation or a recap and like

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:19.570
that stream of consciousness will lead

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:25.390
to other things it's like a I would say

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:26.800
it's like a face to move it I didn't

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.000
think about that way that's a cool way

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:28.930
to think about it cuz you do the

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.160
meditation you're thinking about all

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.810
this stuff and the goal that I've been

00:55:31.810 --> 00:55:33.750
trying to get to is just like non

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:36.850
nonverbal awareness where like I'm just

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:38.320
like today I actually did it which was

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.690
cool which I thought in images for like

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:42.820
five minute clips at its time where I

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:44.500
wouldn't use words I would just let my

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.780
mind create an image and then I would be

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.220
able to mess around with my mental

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.650
imagery really words would pop in I

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:51.640
would just let him go and then you know

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.320
I was doing just purely mental image

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.720
imagery for like five minute blocks and

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.920
I would get interrupted with thoughts

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.350
and go back into it that was the goal no

00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:02.290
were you using plants and fungi for this

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:04.450
no today I did it in the last two times

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:06.880
and so I have this is my third video

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:08.680
meditation journal the first two before

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:11.020
that I did I was doing deep dives which

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.240
is so that's so [ __ ] fun man I do

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.220
that soldier blast churches sacred

00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:17.590
dogology yes a live interactive

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:19.120
experience yes

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:22.240
is this still in the works yeah I was

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.860
like oh all set a date set and then this

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.210
should [ __ ] happen so we might have

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:26.050
to do it online

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:30.480
whoa might have to do an online one whoa

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:34.900
zoom up me and my two high Cardinals

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.760
dudes and zoom up and then this drip one

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.380
then we can live stream that which would

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.720
be off from there yeah so we could live

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.370
stream it from there

00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:44.440
we can even do it remotely too we get

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.760
live stream it so we can do either one

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.200
okay I get pretty good the live

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.250
streaming stuff we should do it all

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:48.610
together

00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:50.650
I'll bring the mixer I mean I got the

00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:52.870
tech side [ __ ] locks down that's

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:55.300
enough yes that would be cool if you

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:56.680
know especially if we have some super

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.750
lame lockdowns I was planning on doing

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.880
it in May so if we're cool in May we'll

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.740
do it as planned and if not we'll do uh

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:06.220
you would just do a live stream yeah you

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:07.510
would you had talked about wanting to

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:11.340
maybe release some of the the deep dive

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.150
what's the word I'm looking for

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:16.150
journal recaps yeah yeah like make them

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:18.700
presentable and shareable and yeah they

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.790
just came out of this yeah yeah I

00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:22.750
definitely

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:24.400
spud last night he was like this is

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.230
definitely very intimate and weird but

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.870
I'm dead i have to i don't feel

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:31.030
compelled to do it and it's like you

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:33.670
have a lot of pressure on your patreon

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:38.230
to dazzle like i I feel like you get no

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:39.430
you know what I don't want to say that

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:41.860
that's that came out wrong because I got

00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.660
out we [ __ ] on the patreon I think it's

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.120
always a good idea I do too and even

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.620
when you get I get pushback people go

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:48.820
like what the [ __ ] is this there's some

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:52.060
people they don't see stuff the same

00:57:52.060 --> 00:58:27.310
thing we always do yeah yeah I mean I've

00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:28.690
been letting that go I'm not even been

00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:30.250
getting like I mean you guys got a

00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:31.360
little bit of snake venom you guys

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.850
finally it when you first started

00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:35.320
everyone saw like you guys are the best

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.510
you rule and it you hit a certain little

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:39.030
like bandwidth and everyone's like

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:43.750
[ __ ] [ __ ] yeah dude it's almost

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:45.940
refreshing because I feel like we had

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:47.110
talked about this I think of the last

00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:49.690
page round where it felt like when you

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:52.090
when you're making progress that's when

00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:53.590
you start the hit [ __ ] like that like

00:58:53.590 --> 00:58:54.760
when you're not doing [ __ ] like there's

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:55.930
never nobody ever gives a [ __ ] about

00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:58.090
anything you're doing but the second

00:58:58.090 --> 00:58:59.550
like you're trying different things or

00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:02.320
or just going out on the limb to be like

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.180
hey this is something I'm doing you're

00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:05.500
gonna start getting that feedback we're

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.590
like nothing but these guys [ __ ] suck

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:10.870
all right that's fine sometimes needs a

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:12.280
little bit of friction to appreciate

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.290
just how fast you're going that's true

00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:15.820
I'm telling ya it's it's good to get

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:17.260
some of that venom in you do I mean it's

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:18.670
not like it goes in you but it's good to

00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:20.020
start interacting with that because it's

00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:23.140
it's a good it's hard because was I

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:24.880
think about this a lot because I I'm

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.990
always trying to stop my automatic

00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:30.940
negative interpretation of the events

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:32.980
and what's going on or I have a very

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.390
self-defeating attitude where I'll be

00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:36.520
like this [ __ ] sucks or if one

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.230
like all this socks on my [ __ ] [ __ ] I

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:39.760
knew it I knew it'd suck but in reality

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.380
that dude just might be you know doing

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.810
what whatever is going on with them but

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:45.550
it's we've all seen people who have

00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:47.200
never been told a bad thing in their

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:50.170
life and it is almost a detriment so you

00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:52.600
do need a little bit of it just it's up

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.550
to you of like but then again none of us

00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:57.940
are at danger for going off into purely

00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.820
like yeah man like you know I can't

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.280
think about describe it by yours now no

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.840
one's ever made fun of you right now we

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.030
need we need bread and milk for the week

01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:08.770
I'm stocked up on getting called a

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:12.369
[ __ ] for the rest of my life we're

01:00:12.369 --> 01:00:16.240
good we ought to make any runs when I

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.860
would I release the meditation journal

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.320
that's at one point in it I think the

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.820
first one I'm like talking all quiet

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.380
because I don't like I don't want anyone

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.119
to hear me and then in one point I do

01:00:25.119 --> 01:00:26.740
say that I'm like I'm pushing back

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.320
against there's a very real thought in

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.820
my head that like someone's gonna come

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:34.740
up behind me with a bullhorn and be like

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.650
yeah then I'm Tony I it's like that uh

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:43.030
it's like we're all part of this kind of

01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:44.920
a throbbing ego mass out of people like

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.080
right now there's a certain like type of

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.290
dude who listens to you know a couple

01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:51.930
bass who listen to this podcast

01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:54.220
especially with the dudes it's like if

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:58.359
you somehow add a new element or like

01:00:58.359 --> 01:01:01.420
show a new dimension of yourself there's

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.400
some people who for some reason that

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.780
[ __ ] them up and they're like [ __ ]

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:07.119
gay stop stop that stop stop they just

01:01:07.119 --> 01:01:09.280
don't want to see people change or

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.290
evolve and that's kind of like you know

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:13.119
that's their thing you know I try not to

01:01:13.119 --> 01:01:14.830
internalize that everyone everyone is

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:16.030
just passing around this external

01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:17.770
negativity and then when they receive it

01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:18.640
they don't know what to do with it so

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.930
they just pass it on as quickly as they

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:22.270
can and then yeah if you have to handle

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:23.980
it dude you can receive it process it it

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.420
doesn't have to bring you down you have

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.650
to transmute it it's the only thing you

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:29.109
can do those transmute mean transmute is

01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:30.700
when you take something like bad and

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.650
change it into something else okay so

01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:33.760
let's say kind of like what out I get

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.260
alchemy turning lead into gold or

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:37.390
someone's hatred and you just you absorb

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:38.890
it for them because they can it's it's

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:40.210
too much for them you're whatever you're

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:42.070
doing is triggering something unbearable

01:01:42.070 --> 01:01:43.840
for them that they then have to go like

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.700
[ __ ] you you [ __ ] and then that's the

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.950
other thing too it's like I mean you

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:50.170
felt online if people send you a nasty

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:52.809
that little like that thing you're

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:54.549
sending out into a comment is literally

01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:56.140
triggering somebody else's nervous

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.940
system and when people send you stuff

01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:59.890
that's kind of cool it's like you have

01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:01.269
the ability to trigger positive

01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:03.010
responses in people's nervous systems by

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:05.109
and not like you know [ __ ] phony

01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:06.519
stuff but by being like damn this is

01:02:06.519 --> 01:02:07.690
awesome I like this and letting them

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:09.279
know and they're like [ __ ] yeah thanks

01:02:09.279 --> 01:02:10.930
it's crazy how many times per day I

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:13.660
catch myself almost not taking the time

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:16.029
to like reach out to somebody and this

01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:17.619
is like people I know this is stranger

01:02:17.619 --> 01:02:19.690
saying nice things it's like I I catch

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:22.569
myself almost not like hitting something

01:02:22.569 --> 01:02:24.569
hitting someone with like something like

01:02:24.569 --> 01:02:27.220
good something they can like savor right

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.619
yeah I'll like stop for a sec I'm like

01:02:29.619 --> 01:02:31.809
damn dude I got a I got I got to get

01:02:31.809 --> 01:02:33.519
some vibes out you know I mean I got a I

01:02:33.519 --> 01:02:34.869
got to push the vibes through the

01:02:34.869 --> 01:02:36.430
[ __ ] play-doh strainer and make

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:38.920
[ __ ] good feelings dude to that point

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.510
like Matt I constantly think about

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:41.680
something you said a while back about

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.299
how like you'll be on the elliptical

01:02:43.299 --> 01:02:45.010
like pushing out good vibes to people I

01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:49.720
I don't like Shane come I am NOT a

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:52.480
naturally positive person so hearing

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.430
that was like a good reminder that like

01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:55.750
this is [ __ ] work

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.940
and a lot of times it's so easy to get

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.309
lost in your own [ __ ] but you have

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:02.859
to stop for me multiple times a day to

01:03:02.859 --> 01:03:05.079
just not only like push out good [ __ ] to

01:03:05.079 --> 01:03:07.089
people but also in the form of like you

01:03:07.089 --> 01:03:08.170
just sets in like in the form of like

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:09.940
comments just like not only people like

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.859
reaching out to you but in you taking

01:03:11.859 --> 01:03:12.970
the initiative to say like hey just

01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:14.170
checking up on you man I hope things are

01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:15.460
going well and you know that's gonna be

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:17.039
a good year for you and [ __ ] like that

01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:20.140
yeah that's true and also to not uh this

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:21.369
is the thing to like I've been trying to

01:03:21.369 --> 01:03:23.200
get more positive but it's also the same

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.019
time you can't you're not gonna you're

01:03:26.019 --> 01:03:27.430
gonna have your negativity you need it

01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:28.869
there so it's like I've been trying to

01:03:28.869 --> 01:03:31.569
keep like to kind of get real and touch

01:03:31.569 --> 01:03:33.579
with that and kind of use my negativity

01:03:33.579 --> 01:03:34.960
in a way that's constructive rather than

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.119
just having it focused on me constantly

01:03:37.119 --> 01:03:38.950
all the time mm-hmm that makes sense

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:41.039
yeah hell yeah dude just being like okay

01:03:41.039 --> 01:03:44.200
you know using my critical eye in a way

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.910
that serves me rather than its limiting

01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:47.170
it you know if you're if you're credit

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:49.029
if you're a self critical thoughts limit

01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:51.009
you that's a sad way to think about

01:03:51.009 --> 01:03:52.599
sending a lot spending life of just like

01:03:52.599 --> 01:03:54.759
keeping yourself locked down in this

01:03:54.759 --> 01:03:56.950
weird state where like you might get

01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:58.839
made fun of so you don't actually like

01:03:58.839 --> 01:04:00.759
fully express whatever that whatever

01:04:00.759 --> 01:04:03.099
your self your innate self is well did

01:04:03.099 --> 01:04:03.849
have that locked

01:04:03.849 --> 01:04:06.069
behind a wall of like I might get called

01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:07.569
a [ __ ] or something okay I'm stalking

01:04:07.569 --> 01:04:08.799
that we're not when Tim and I were

01:04:08.799 --> 01:04:10.989
communicating earlier today we had a

01:04:10.989 --> 01:04:13.599
government protocol a trying different

01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:14.920
things like with the patreon and we're

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.680
gonna continue to do more that but it

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.299
was like the realization said that you

01:04:19.299 --> 01:04:20.799
know it was really us against ourselves

01:04:20.799 --> 01:04:22.839
the entire time because so much of us

01:04:22.839 --> 01:04:25.869
not progressing in [ __ ] comedy or

01:04:25.869 --> 01:04:27.549
anything creative or just you know

01:04:27.549 --> 01:04:28.930
anything that we originally thought

01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:30.339
might have been a good idea and not

01:04:30.339 --> 01:04:32.559
seeing through to the end was just us I

01:04:32.559 --> 01:04:34.029
think was that little voice of like

01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:35.680
picturing even a lot of times picturing

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:38.410
a very specific person criticizing you

01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:40.359
mmm the second you want to step out on a

01:04:40.359 --> 01:04:41.739
limb I think often times there's always

01:04:41.739 --> 01:04:44.170
the one person that for some reason pops

01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:46.180
up that you can envision and saying you

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:49.059
are and it's oftentimes it will limit

01:04:49.059 --> 01:04:51.729
you yep you're getting into your psychic

01:04:51.729 --> 01:04:53.619
landscape with like there's a fear

01:04:53.619 --> 01:04:55.299
there's like the object relations theory

01:04:55.299 --> 01:04:57.279
say like your brain becomes populated

01:04:57.279 --> 01:05:00.309
with the first from the people in the

01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:01.839
early years in your life and how they

01:05:01.839 --> 01:05:03.609
relate to you you then embody them

01:05:03.609 --> 01:05:04.630
mentally and then you're always

01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:06.309
imagining them kind of populating your

01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:07.539
brain as you're trying to do stuff

01:05:07.539 --> 01:05:09.999
there's two people in particular that

01:05:09.999 --> 01:05:12.729
still pop out stop pop up not often as

01:05:12.729 --> 01:05:14.950
much now but two friends that I had from

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:16.900
my teenage years since my early 30s that

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.099
were just critical of everything just

01:05:18.099 --> 01:05:19.359
because they were two little [ __ ]

01:05:19.359 --> 01:05:21.849
[ __ ] [ __ ] Steve yeah one of them

01:05:21.849 --> 01:05:26.019
yes but it was it was literally and any

01:05:26.019 --> 01:05:27.519
time you thought of something different

01:05:27.519 --> 01:05:29.680
like I remember one point where I worked

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.059
with a guy who was a minister and he

01:05:31.059 --> 01:05:33.609
invited me to come over his house to do

01:05:33.609 --> 01:05:34.809
like a Bible reading I was like yeah

01:05:34.809 --> 01:05:37.900
that's fight father beef he was

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.089
definitely let's just say I just wanted

01:05:40.089 --> 01:05:41.469
to do something different and I liked

01:05:41.469 --> 01:05:43.450
him he was a cool guy so the second I

01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:44.769
mentioned that it was like it was

01:05:44.769 --> 01:05:46.509
legitimate anger toward me like what the

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:49.150
[ __ ] are you doing going to another

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:51.450
person's house to [ __ ] talk about God

01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:53.979
like Jesus Christ like you don't have to

01:05:53.979 --> 01:05:57.339
do anything yeah that's very bizarre but

01:05:57.339 --> 01:05:58.269
like that's so weird

01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:59.739
but I would get those are the two voices

01:05:59.739 --> 01:06:01.960
that I would hear most often not as much

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.670
anymore but it they still pop up but

01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:05.079
especially like when I was friends with

01:06:05.079 --> 01:06:07.029
those guys any time I would think about

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:08.579
doing anything different other than

01:06:08.579 --> 01:06:11.259
getting [ __ ] up and being and playing

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:13.630
the clown for them it would be that

01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:15.099
voice there one of their voices popping

01:06:15.099 --> 01:06:16.840
and saying what the [ __ ] are you doing

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.880
yeah that's again and then what are they

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.200
you know what do they get out of having

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.640
you do that you know what I mean

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.650
yeah speaking of weird [ __ ] on the

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:25.240
patreon I actually woke up and did

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.630
Mike's guy dad meditation today how did

01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:30.430
it go if I felt incredible I felt like a

01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:32.860
million document I that was thing I did

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.780
was [ __ ] funny do my alarm went off I

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.150
woke up and I hit play that was exactly

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:39.430
it was my plan for the morning and just

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:41.980
dude here in the [ __ ] hearing your

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:45.220
[ __ ] soothing baritone it's

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.690
legitimately one of the funniest things

01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:48.190
I've ever heard in my entire life

01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:49.630
Thanks well I it's not even it's

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:50.710
probably not even close it's probably

01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:53.350
the funniest three and a half to five

01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:56.650
minutes of anything I've ever listened

01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:58.150
to my entire life this means a lot to me

01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:00.970
man while taking a dump and I was like a

01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:06.850
total nirvana Mike was like we should do

01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:09.910
this and he sent me some ideas and I was

01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:11.710
like all right cool I just obviously I

01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:14.050
was finishing up the audio upgrades in

01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:15.460
the house for the [ __ ] twitch stream

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.110
and I was like yeah I just come over and

01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:18.790
record it and we were gonna record it

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:20.320
together and both just like pitch jokes

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.870
and as soon as Mike started I just

01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:25.870
turned my mic off I was like nah dude it

01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:27.580
felt like it felt like I was watching

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:30.010
something special it was incredible it

01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.560
good bad I'm sorry no is that one take

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.170
you did it in yes yeah

01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:37.360
dude first try grace one take first try

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.340
he's the one take kid I was dude I was

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:40.900
like I was like the producer in the

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:42.760
movies of like the band with the big hit

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:49.000
I was like your sound effects are

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:56.740
hilarious too like that we've had an

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.420
idea to do [ __ ] like that you know

01:07:58.420 --> 01:07:59.950
almost since the inception of this

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:01.780
podcast but I think it's the same thing

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:03.760
it's just like for whatever reason there

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.410
was always like yeah maybe not today

01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:06.700
we're gonna do today that's just like

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:09.130
yeah we didn't get around to it but just

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:10.750
finally doing something different other

01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:12.640
than just putting random podcasts up on

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.860
the patreon felt good and even better

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.420
like just people saying nice things

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.339
about it because that goes a long way

01:08:18.339 --> 01:08:20.290
like I was telling my wife today that my

01:08:20.290 --> 01:08:22.270
flick might my confidence specifically

01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:24.580
with creativity at any given moment it

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:27.160
can be through the [ __ ] roof or I

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.680
could feel like I'm getting [ __ ] on

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.690
and it really does like when people

01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:34.030
really [ __ ] go out of their way just

01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:35.860
to say something nice about something

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:37.600
you created it really [ __ ] goes a

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.180
long way big time dude I'm gonna uh say

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:43.750
where is this damn it I had a book down

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:46.150
here it's called the courage to create

01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:47.230
by Rolo maze

01:08:47.230 --> 01:08:50.440
it's a damn it I don't know where it is

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.970
it's probably buried underneath a bunch

01:08:51.970 --> 01:08:53.980
of [ __ ] it's been the whole time man

01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:55.810
it'll be like within you the whole time

01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:58.660
it is but this this is the coolest way

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.310
to thing about it so he he talks it now

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:01.420
I've only gotten to the very beginning

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:05.740
of it but he talks about how no matter

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:08.770
what like of all the virtues of like you

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:10.390
know people being kind or this or that

01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:13.300
if you don't have the courage to do any

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.590
of those that courage is the one thing

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:16.180
that enables all the other things so if

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:17.770
you kind of hide behind you can be the

01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:19.600
nicest person in the world but if you're

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.060
too scared to like be nice at a time

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:23.320
when you have to be that could cause

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.630
kind of a problem or like you know if

01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:26.920
you have great ideas you could be the

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.030
brilliant most brilliant person in the

01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:29.050
world but if you don't have the courage

01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:30.310

01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:33.820
