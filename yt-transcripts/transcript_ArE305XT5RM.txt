00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.110
Park and a black a black dude who was a

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.210
bird watcher so that's the level of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.650
threat we're talking about as far as

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.799

with Chinese symbols on it yeah

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.399
basically they got the whitest argument

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.960
possible like her dog was off her leash

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.329
in the area of Central Park where bird

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.820
watchers bird watchers go and he didn't

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.619
want the dog scaring off the birds so it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.880
was like ma'am you have to put that dog

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.490

cuz during the phone call she's

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.180

don't realize it's it's what we've

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.320
literally been pointing out and what

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.700

2016 yeah you and I yep like we've had

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.470
our [ __ ] swords out against this for

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.080
years just white liberals being racist

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.510
as fuk yeah and then hiding behind this

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.479
weird like holier-than-thou like can you

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.760
believe Trump supporters are so stupid

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.130
so you're just as dumb you're just as

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.560
dumb you're equals yeah maybe the same

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.500
people well you know they've been

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.910
building their personality for the last

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.710
four years and how they are like morally

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.660
superior to everybody else and it's like

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.750
it just it all it takes is one

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.820
birdwatcher being like a keep a dog on a

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.870
leash yeah more rowdy out the window

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.510
dude that's funny I mean it's also also

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.080
big news today Jimmy Fallon tweeted out

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.270
that he was very sorry for doing a

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.820
blackface impression of Chris Rock on

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.840
SNL in mm I don't know that's also funny

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.910
too to just not think for yourself for

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.080
the point we're just like what do you do

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.660
we're doing black okay no oh now that's

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.870
the wrong decision nah man whoa

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.210
well I thought I'd like black face now I

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.979
don't you know that's a pretty good

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:16.010
Fallon oh I was five pound for a minute

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.169
really if you've been practicing Fallon

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:22.280
it no I haven't practiced like ever

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.810
since he made fun of Neil Young I was

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.990
like [ __ ] you dude that's what he

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.410
personally and he did the year he hit

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.820
the year though here pretty hard which

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.200
is funny all these people that like

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.940
visit it I think he might have been

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.620
reading his own reddit comments cuz I

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.820
don't I think he just made a pre-emptive

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.060
apology for no reason he just came out

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.060
was like dude him first of all yeah

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.740
that's funny it's funny he was like oh

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.840
by the way totally forgot about this and

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.979
missed all these people losing their

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:49.940
jobs and stuff

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.550
just jog I just saw my facebook timeline

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.960
is probably him in blackface it was like

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.520
remember this you should [ __ ] in here

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.380
goes actually you should probably read

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.200
it with your accent in 2000 while on SNL

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.060
I made a terrible decision to do an

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.800
impersonation of Chris Rock while in

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.020
blackface there is no excuse for this I

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.700
am very sorry for making this

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.919
unquestionably offensive decision and

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:15.200
thank all of you for holding me

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.250
accountable unquestionably offensive

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.780
decision that's honestly like close to

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.940
the verbage that NBC was trying to get

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.970
me to say it's very close how's it look

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.340
house I think they have a houses black

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.039
face first of all I'm sure it's wildly

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.860
offensive saying is he good at it or is

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.419
he bad at it I like I think he's good

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:42.770
he's good at impressions I thought to

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.750
say he did I mean I that's I want to

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.040
know if I get any Oh young impression

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.990
consider us you know beef is squash like

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.459
I consider blackface as long as you come

00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:51.760
out and say like [ __ ] of McNeely on

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.889

00:08:53.889 --> 00:08:57.970
off blackface Jimmy that's funny I was

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.459
just typing it in realized blackface

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.490
trying to think because black party's

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.530

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.620
like when it became so like when I you

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.780

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.550
fair game that's all you have to do to

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:21.990
counteract to get into trouble for black

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.400

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.010
resolution you have to admit the fact

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.980
that as crazy as it sounds if you watch

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.720
a certain news you can be racist too

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.490
it's amazing yeah even though we all

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:18.270
watch this

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.160
same television show we can still be

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.070
racist dude I went to I was in a I was

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.160
we went and visited some of the birds

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.300
family up in like North Jersey and super

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.010
nice people but they watch there again

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.260
it's like they'll watch CNN like my mom

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.060
watches Fox so like we're sitting there

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.120
and it's just like the talk is just if

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.610
you don't it what the whole time was

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.230
just like what the [ __ ] were they saying

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.120
oh they're like yeah the numbers is

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.470
there you know like right now they did a

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.600
thing we're like there's less Cova

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.520
deaths and Republican states versus

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.770
Democrat states on average there's two

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.570
times the amount of deaths and an blue

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.310
state than there is three times

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.660
including New York City if you don't

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.710
include a New York City there's two

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.820
times the amount of death it's just

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.190
double Democrat states and it's funny

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.330
because everyone's like [ __ ]

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.890
Democrats are juicing the numbers and I

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:05.880
was at a house where they're like

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.230
[ __ ] Republicans are lying so

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.520
everyone's convinced everyone else's

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.250
juice know oh yeah which is so [ __ ]

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.080
funny because it's kind of simple cuz

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.270
Democrat states are first off they're

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.990
close to New York and LA and where they

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.290
just have major cities yeah that's all

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.270
of this yeah I was thinking about that

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.650
it's pretty that's a pretty easy one

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.180
that it's a pretty easy way to look

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.290
through it but I was wondering I'm like

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.700
it has to be like I said just the fact

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.170
that blue states oh yeah and I'm you

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.260
kind of the other yeah and the other one

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.720
like Montana has like clearly not

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.660
getting cross but the the funny about it

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.130
was like it is so funny to sit there

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.480
dude it was the whole everyone there

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.860
again and this and that and there it's

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.360
just the same thing like just Facebook

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.800
takes the whole [ __ ] time them

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.330
sitting there just like eating kebabs

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.420
just like yeah right I think I'd have a

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.740
daughter now I just stared at her the

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.080
whole time like this is nice your

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.620
daughter's like a phone pick it up and

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.970
look at it this is better but it it is

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.860
dude it's like the more people who get

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.630
for me are getting hooked on the news

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.300
it's like the amount or people will just

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.780
assign their whatever their discernment

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.430
of reality to a corporation that

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.290
benefits from telling them what they

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.390
want to hear and be like this is what it

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.520
is it's like dude it's so [ __ ] it's

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.700
literally it's like people it's like

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.590
them like just looking through a Nike

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.780
sign and just being like oh yeah and

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.010
this one's like Reebok you're like what

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.150
the [ __ ] are you talking about it's just

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.260
like it's wrong

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.150
cherry-pick that it's it's so [ __ ]

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.970
nuts watch Peter there's a company that

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.830
profits off of just kind of corralling

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.360
your reality in a way that makes you

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.530
feel like you're always right and it's

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.360
like I can't believe people actually

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.310

like it or not the like she's getting

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.780
the death penalty from society right now

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.590
for what she did yeah and she she might

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.360
be the first this is a rough one for a

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.490
white liberal lady from New York yeah

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.180
and her dog getting taken away is the

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.180
real dagger so funny

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.700

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.040
what happened she she had a mental

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.290
breakdown and somebody filmed it on look

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:23.850
I'm not saying what she was doing wasn't

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.060
you know wrong yeah but she clearly if

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.350
you're doing something that's stupid

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.630
you've lost your [ __ ] mind she's at

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.730
it yes and she likely can hear in the

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.350
video she has she's totally out of

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:38.180
breath she's like yeah yes I think me

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.060
like and she's strangling her dog like

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.500

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.210
dog as high up as she came with her

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.800
collar for some reason she's looser and

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.540
[ __ ] mind in it and now you know

she's gonna lose her job and her dog and

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.300
get caught her races forever and yeah I

00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:01.020
mean it's also it's also the fact that

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.270
nobody knows anything about this like

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.459
and was she running around a hundred

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:07.440
percent or do you know what like what

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.120
was her childhood like what's she up to

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.329

cover that who the [ __ ] knows

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.990
oh yeah it's instantly the first thing

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.240
you go to is like this was a totally

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.070
perfectly functioning racist lady who

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.260
freaked out on a black guy it's like yes

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.320
or maybe that's the story maybe yeah not

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.089
maybe she had a [ __ ] maybe she

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:28.740
completely detached from reality and

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.740
freaked out yeah and then it sued him

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.970

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.320
these you know kangaroo courts these

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.750
Peters you know I hate to see lynch mob

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:03.010
defending a racist lady you can't say

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:06.130
that but that's kind of what at these

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.470
social these these mobs on Twitter just

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.770
it's hang a person yeah immediately yeah

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.270

right it's like no I mean do it did just

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.730
the you know the crimes are not matching

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.679
the the punishments here

00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:23.830
well judgments are like you're dead yeah

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.179
well here this is the problem it's like

00:19:25.179 --> 00:19:28.179
their you know their information diet

00:19:28.179 --> 00:19:29.830
they're going to a fountain like a soda

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.690
fountain with only lemon-lime Gatorade

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.490
and that thing's gone all the time and

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:34.870
so whatever they get anything they're

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.419
just like lemon lime Gatorade [ __ ]

00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:38.590
off with it rather than being what

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.240
actually happened you know or waiting a

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.220
[ __ ] day to be able to see what else

00:19:59.409 --> 00:20:02.210
you know it's a figurative guillotine

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.830

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.960
if we were all standing around and like

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.220

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.539
have cut that lady's head off if we

00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:10.370
didn't have social media the same

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.990

everybody in the town and everybody

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.120

exactly as literally she's dead and it's

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.559
not even that big of a deal if so if you

00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:56.330
get caught freaking out in a park and

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.390
calling the police on a black dude sure

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.520

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.010
gas up to your company that yes is a bad

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.990
look dude we're [ __ ] out but first

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.059
like to have the army of people who are

00:22:08.059 --> 00:22:09.649

alright that's cool that's true I mean

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.960
like yeah it's up to her company to fire

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.460
her for sure if they want to fire

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.559
whatever if somebody is unstable enough

00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:25.759
that they're doing that yet

00:22:25.759 --> 00:22:27.590
they probably shouldn't be in charge of

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.869
anything they should give her desk duty

00:22:29.869 --> 00:22:31.580
like a cop if you think you're off the

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:36.200
street yeah true I'm one of these

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.730
insurance companies needs to have the

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.119
same like spine and defense of their own

00:22:41.119 --> 00:22:43.609
as as the [ __ ] police do well these

00:22:43.609 --> 00:22:45.559

00:25:25.849 --> 00:25:27.619
theirs so pedophilia where he like did

00:25:27.619 --> 00:25:29.690

00:25:34.369 --> 00:25:36.889
Jackson or whatever he was like grad he

00:25:36.889 --> 00:25:39.679

you got to give the mid Michael Jackson

00:25:49.279 --> 00:25:50.749

after you sexually assault them is it a

00:26:11.749 --> 00:26:14.779

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.620

was just cool with it it kind of funny

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:17.260
business guys a little funny

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.900
it's like raping children yeah they knew

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.630
it it was that's true

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.100

libs on that last night she like looked

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.880

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.400
be he's like I'm all for women in combat

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.260
the American Civil War

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.730
I mean first off there were some women

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:44.620
in there we've covered that 18:21

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.620
departed attitude I just stopped myself

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.060
and spilled a glass of water my computer

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:49.870
pretty happy about that

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.270
yeah that sounds that's funny I was

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.060

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.680

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.420
like spiked this thought in my head but

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.610
I was thinking about the whole I think I

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.960
was watching something on TV but it was

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.840
like the whole idea of like the dad when

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.250
like his daughter starting to date

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.990

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.610
about the dad just being like if you

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.440

[ __ ] to do it on a date

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.499
[Laughter]

00:28:40.499 --> 00:28:43.419
those dudes that do that the guys that

00:28:43.419 --> 00:28:44.769

because of the rules yeah I think it

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.429
should be more focused instead of being

00:29:00.429 --> 00:29:02.860
like a weirdly like that you better not

like you talking in a guy a big look man

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.950
when you base relationships strictly

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.989
based off trying to come bad things

00:29:10.989 --> 00:29:12.429
happen in your life like forget about

00:29:12.429 --> 00:29:14.559

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.650
wear masks when they're off and they're

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:42.000

00:50:25.079 --> 00:50:26.849
more of a European theater world war two

00:50:26.849 --> 00:50:29.609
American tree you could see himself in

00:50:29.609 --> 00:50:34.170
those scenarios or in Desert Storm he

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:35.819
didn't see himself as a desert camo big

00:50:35.819 --> 00:50:37.680
time Desert Storm guy yeah we need a

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:38.940
good dose of storms

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.770
desert storms a good war for a lot of

00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:42.540
those guys yeah we need a good war that

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:43.790
everyone can get by

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:47.480
that we can easily win you know any norm

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.580

like the Philippines just to like things

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.250
would be tough dude Philippines he's not

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:00.290
yeah I think every citizen there has

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:02.690
like five guns [ __ ] hats to wear tied

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:04.010
you all do where to him Trump or too

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:05.630
much of boys anywhere we couldn't go

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.280
with them we got a sure they'd be an

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.080
ally baby you know yeah oh he's been

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.880
murdering drug dealer so Trump is like

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:14.000
we just gotta go in like you know take

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.220
the condom off and go in on Isis just go

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.140
back into Syria and just that's that

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:19.790
would that's a layup of a victory and

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:22.880
roof kind of righteous yeah it's a

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.410
defeat aren't they done I thought

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:25.850
they're like yeah they're pretty much

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:27.140
done but I'm saying get in there and

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:28.850
really we would have to go to war I

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:32.090
think with what's-his-name president

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:37.520
Syria now massage Assad or some Assad

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.820
yeah yeah true yeah that's that would be

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.070
an easy one we should uh yeah we do need

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:45.380
a good a good victory we have tuned

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:47.420
somebody up to boost morale in this

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.590

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.720
need to put up to win the war I don't

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.250
know we got Amy Cooper calling the cops

00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:59.630
on a birdwatcher I think it's time for

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:02.410
us to invade like a Caribbean nation

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:04.400
although they've been taken care of

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:08.260
they've been neutered the Caribbean

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:13.280
something easy yeah yeah yeah you don't

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.110
come out like reclaiming like what we

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:16.460

French or like English like st. Martin's

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.140

exist just you know Canadians remember

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.420
that we [ __ ] allow you to exist true

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:45.710
as Isis attacked Canada at all no we

00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:46.670

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.700
literally think they all extort us

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:57.140
that's what Trump says Trump says

00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.850
they're taking they're taking advantage

00:53:58.850 --> 00:54:01.040
they are none of them really even have

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.510
to build a military because they know we

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:05.090

something to do where you can kind of

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.010

with paintballing so you're just kind of

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:09.880

up like right next to it'll be a

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.070
non-stop dogfight dude you guys would be

next to each other the entire board yeah

00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:24.160

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.740
we're talking 850 ad we're talking I

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:39.380
took an Irish Irish clan in the center

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:41.119
of Europe or in the centre of Ireland

01:04:41.119 --> 01:04:44.150
but Vikings invade constantly I'm trying

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:46.100
to unite the clans under Christianity

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.869

like it's you can't hurt I've been fired

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.600
existence was so hard for them that like

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.510
getting set on fire was probably like it

01:06:56.510 --> 01:07:00.590
hurt yeah but not like not like everyday

01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:02.320
did true

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.120
no I'm saying their pain tolerance like

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.860
if you got caught it trust me getting

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:08.120
caught on fire any time in history

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.020
wasn't great

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:12.890
yes sucked but the joke I was trying to

01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:15.740
make was handling handle suffering

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.080
pretty well Oh big time dude it would

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.400
also be like how'd he die

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.080
laid him on fire they're like oh yeah

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.050

01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:34.760
[ __ ] lit on fire we'll see how he

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:42.260
does he's still on yeah I love the for

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:44.060
some reason I I think it's so funny that

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.640
just set on fire was like a way a lot of

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:51.860
people have died in history like you

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.420
know you're born you go through your

01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:54.710
whole life and then at the very end you

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:57.500
just take off or back when they started

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.940
courts and they're like what did you do

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:00.710
like yeah I lived their whole family on

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:03.320
fire what happened [ __ ] stole my

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.510
sheep you're like all right we gotta

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:06.590
come up with some laws about this we're

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:09.110
not sure how this way judges well now we

01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:14.180
should set you on fire yeah [ __ ] and I

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:17.900
got my sheep stolen and fired this

01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:20.060
doesn't seem right there was a did I

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.230
think I talked about this where they

01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:23.330
were [ __ ] it was the guy Milton who

01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:23.960
wrote power

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.390
lost he got real into this English and

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:27.890
this I think is it 1600s there is a

01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:29.359
political movement where they're like oh

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.370
and we're the political party where you

01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:33.259
can we can behead Kings if they [ __ ] up

01:08:33.259 --> 01:08:35.569
and I think he like lived through like a

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.489
Bloody Disgusting revolution and was

01:08:37.489 --> 01:08:39.560
like I was a really bad idea I don't

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.239
think we should have done that I wrote

01:08:41.239 --> 01:08:42.049
Paradise Lost

01:08:42.049 --> 01:08:44.569
Oh where's Paradise Lost I wonder if

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:49.489
that was by the I don't know anything

01:08:49.489 --> 01:08:50.960
about Paradise Lost I wonder if that was

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.509
by the French Revolution I think I think

01:08:53.509 --> 01:08:56.210
he was an English beau yeah but if he

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:58.190
would have been alive for know yes well

01:08:58.190 --> 01:08:59.359
I think he was catching some of that

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:01.460
heat he was a friend I don't know he was

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:04.339
like to be 100 years before okay so he

01:09:04.339 --> 01:09:06.890
was definitely so he was like a

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:08.049
Kingslayer

01:09:08.049 --> 01:09:10.940
yeah 16th century I don't know what the

01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.710
[ __ ] was going on then there's a weird

01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:14.230
that was when we were coming over here

01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:16.400
yeah always started making their ways

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.020
over here that was I think that was

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.279
around the time when people were like is

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:22.569
the king really God and they're like

01:09:22.569 --> 01:09:28.100
