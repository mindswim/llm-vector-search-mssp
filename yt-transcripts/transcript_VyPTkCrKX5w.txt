definitely don't let me see it

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.940
definitely don't break it out that's a

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.280
good move I used to sell coke and I used

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.750
to tell people they would I never did it

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.320
in my life

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.880
and they would be like here's a lot they

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.470
were like try soon as I got it it's

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.910
funny when people buy coke they

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.680
typically do it immediately after they

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.940
buy it yeah definitely they're

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.410
definitely like the people who wear the

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.740
shoes out of the store they put it down

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.419
and it's like done as fast as they go

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.520
yeah they'd always lay a line out for me

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.230
oh my god nah dude if I do this I'll go

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.570

and then walked off telling you dude Oh

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.450
tricky about this he's here he's like

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:59.230
put your kid in this box on the island

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.530

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.790
to I have to like get it from spud but

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.230
he got real into the whole thing of

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.679
Epstein and his whole weird ties to

00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:21.799
Mossad how the massage basically we were

00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:22.760
saying though that's what there's the

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.260
theory right now cuz he now we're

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.940
bringing the Jews into this no just a

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:32.960
Jewish CIA Jewish CIA is raping kids no

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.940
no it wasn't no I'm sorry I'll let you

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.640
finish this is what this is basically

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.320
how he laid it out to me that I've kind

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.780
of you know taking it apparently Epstein

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.890
was a like a school like a tutor so he

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:47.299
was already at interacting with like a

00:21:47.299 --> 00:21:48.890
bunch of high school girls and stuff and

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.750
all this stuff and anyone from that

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.970
somehow to Baron Stern's managing only

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.070
billionaires money which was like what

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.190
the [ __ ] weird so they think that the

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.260
Mossad or the American CIA which you

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.070
know they're probably pretty much the

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:04.190
same thing but they they think that

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.380
people think that he was approached and

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.230
sent up as a honey pot to where like so

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.700
like when people stop getting all like

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.100
into like religion and civic duty these

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.809
the people in high government and

00:22:14.809 --> 00:22:18.950
intelligence mostly are like sociopaths

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.260
so the only way they can keep each other

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.570
in check is with like hardcore blackmail

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.429
so it's like you have so you have this

00:22:25.429 --> 00:22:27.049
guy Epstein's person little buzzing

00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:28.280
around like i'll come i'll and i'm a

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.750
billionaire they don't know where the

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.010
[ __ ] is money comes from there's no

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.049
pictures of this guy from before it

00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:36.200
seems like he's a CI based on the not

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.820
like the unavailability of like pictures

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.340
information on this guy Lee

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.750
people to believe that he's somehow

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.160
involved and they couldn't Intelligence

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.500
Agency and they think that the thing he

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.480
was doing was like bringing high-profile

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.400
politicians and all these people to his

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.290
Island and then he just grabbed dirt on

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.550
him cuz you're like yeah we're partying

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.260
and like oh by the way that chick was 15

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.510
bro and we videoed the whole thing so

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.760
here's what women do because it's like

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.470
if you look into it almost like Willie

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.890

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.920
then you're just like no you don't know

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.300
what the [ __ ] well you know the deal who

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.520

comes out of nowhere and all of a sudden

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.430
is managing billionaires money and it's

like you know they think it was ruling

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.230

way more little dot connected again just

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.850
a theory but interesting theory people

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.170
are looking people really look into the

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:27.460

whole class turned on me pretty the

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.679
whole class guy most well it's like did

00:24:56.679 --> 00:24:58.509
you bring up the girls that get raped or

00:24:58.509 --> 00:25:00.610
mature naturals well though that was

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:01.960
from that book I read the body keeping

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.340
score on another big there's a

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.809
conspiracy around the guy who wrote that

00:25:04.809 --> 00:25:06.759
book I won't even get into fan brought

00:25:06.759 --> 00:25:09.429
me a blood meridian dude you're gonna

00:25:09.429 --> 00:25:12.340
love that oh dude that was that was

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.409
written for you yeah so [ __ ] good and

00:25:14.409 --> 00:25:16.000
excited dads in it he's called the judge

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.299
oh this is great Matt says the judge is

00:25:19.299 --> 00:25:21.070
like my dad and the guy was like that

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.299
guy's like the biggest piece of [ __ ] in

00:25:22.299 --> 00:25:25.419
the whole thing now he's the man dude

00:25:25.419 --> 00:25:26.710
honest you'll read it you're gonna

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.220
respect the judge the judges obviously

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:33.690
you know can't handle the [ __ ] judge

00:25:34.769 --> 00:25:39.190
so the uh-oh so I'm in there and we're

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.500
doing the we're doing like the sex and

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:47.500
we're doing the LGBT qi+ thing and it's

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.110
like they start talking about the you

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.159
know the different genders and people

00:25:51.159 --> 00:25:52.480
are doing their same [ __ ] of like

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.879
well I think it's isn't that it's just

00:25:54.879 --> 00:25:56.320
like turns into the echo-chamber stuff

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.360
and you know that people are going I'm

00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.950
sitting there like oh my god this is

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.720
just a waste of time and then I don't

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.730
know what hat I started reading it and

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.620
people started hitting me with a like

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.179
well you know like biological sex is

00:26:07.179 --> 00:26:08.860
just as social construction I'm like

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.379
dude I just can't you're still saying

00:26:11.379 --> 00:26:13.179
this I don't understand I'm like in sort

00:26:13.179 --> 00:26:14.889
finally I'm like all right I've had

00:26:14.889 --> 00:26:17.110
enough and then uh some like look I

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.870
raised my hand I'm like I'm not I was

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:20.950
like we're you know we're moving into

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.980
this whole like continuous t'k future of

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.269
like looking at gender and we're

00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:26.950
deconstructing all these things and I'm

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.049
like that's cool but like if you're

00:26:29.049 --> 00:26:30.580
gonna deconstruct gender and be like

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.610
this is just this like what genders

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.200
there's a social constructs it's not

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.090
don't wise why are you guys so freaked

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.159
out about it to like basically

00:26:38.159 --> 00:26:40.990
heterosexual cisgender people like why

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:42.220
do you make such a big deal about it

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.809
like I was saying it's a paradox because

00:26:43.809 --> 00:26:45.070
you guys are deconstructing it on one

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.720
level thing what's the big deal and then

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.370
be like but if you don't get my [ __ ]

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.259
right you're a [ __ ] bigot and [ __ ]

00:26:50.259 --> 00:26:51.610
if you don't memorize the fact that I'm

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.440
like a bully in a girl at the same time

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.789
if you can't conceptualize that you're

00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:56.590
obviously a piece of [ __ ] I'm like so it

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.750
is it a big deal is it not like it's

00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:59.980
kind of like it to me it's kind of

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.990
paradoxical to like you have this on the

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.279
one side then it's important it seems

00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:04.480
kind of like you're just peace and stuff

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.350
together and I was like dude

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.900
my whole thing is is like I could sit

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.150
here and be like oh yeah no totally but

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.010
I'd be lying there's like it doesn't on

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.960
a logical level it doesn't make sense to

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.429
me I'm not opposed to it I just

00:27:16.429 --> 00:27:18.830
literally I've never had it explained to

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.240
me in a way that I honestly can say oh

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.080
that makes sense

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.870
bro people started [ __ ] calming it

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.429
strong man and me to death feel like

00:27:25.429 --> 00:27:27.260
well littered I'm like yeah I never said

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.730
that like that's not that's not what I'm

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:29.720
saying at all and then they start

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.190
getting into biological sex and they're

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.020
like biological sex is a social

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.230
construct like it which is a colonial

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.539
thing that we imposed on other cultures

00:27:38.539 --> 00:27:41.210
and I'm like what the [ __ ] dude it was

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.380
crazy and I was like so why does the

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.570
moral clock start the 1600s first of all

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:45.890
I don't think that's a little convenient

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:47.299
and weird we were trying to blame

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:48.590
everything on [ __ ] white people it

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.179
makes sense to start the moral clock it

00:27:50.179 --> 00:27:53.299
like and then 1600s evil

00:27:53.299 --> 00:27:55.280
took over the world it's like wow these

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.630
new hundreds things were great yeah

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.159
through so then people start hitting me

00:27:58.159 --> 00:27:59.960
with like I'm like well I hate to break

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.299
it I'm like you guys can be like you

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:05.030
guys can go into like um you know like

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.340
dual gender stuff you can have that

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.409
without having to try to obliterate the

00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:11.450
idea of biological sex and how that was

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.669
an organizing principle for our species

00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:16.460
no there are societies outside of

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.590
European colonialists at cultures that

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.330
like didn't organize themselves around

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.370
it I'm like so can you blame one dude

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.630
she goes I wish I could think of one

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.400
right now but I can't my god I always do

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.039
this obviously and like maybe that could

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:28.970
probably just be some weird

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.950
archeological archeological theory that

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.720
they came around like so they dug

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.799
something up and they're like oh yeah

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:35.539
dude these guys didn't care about like

00:28:35.539 --> 00:28:38.059
great there was the Native Americans

00:28:38.059 --> 00:28:42.740
that Tuesday's the women hunted and the

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.770
men stayed home yeah and farmed it was

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.280
like oh so that gender roles so they

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.669
thought hunting was gay so then like

00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:54.650
tell other dudes were farming like oh

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:59.299
yeah dudes would hunt and the girls

00:28:59.299 --> 00:29:00.679
would gather and they said that

00:29:00.679 --> 00:29:03.080
typically what it's like oh I wonder why

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.370
that happened why do you think that

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.870
happened oh because physically that's

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:06.559
how that works

00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:09.169
yeah that's how it works well my thing

00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:10.490
was I was like so you I'm like dude I'm

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:12.380
talking like go it wasn't like hunting

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.080
was more fun so the guys got to do it

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.460
it's kind of sake it was terrifying dude

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.140
chasing a wild boar fighting a [ __ ]

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.559
saber-toothed tiger

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:23.159
with a [ __ ] stick it's nuts but there

00:29:23.159 --> 00:29:25.289
it was like in their head it's all it

00:29:25.289 --> 00:29:27.299
was all like Xena Warrior Princess

00:29:27.299 --> 00:29:29.279
we're like guys geysers in the jungle

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:31.350
being like oh babe you're so much faster

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.480
than me it was like a pocket lift oh the

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.929
girl just [ __ ] flies past yes I'll be

00:29:36.929 --> 00:29:39.240
there and I'm like I'm like dude you got

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.799
like this is good you guys are like you

00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:43.019
know figuring out a way for people who

00:29:43.019 --> 00:29:45.269
aren't represented by the binary to like

00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:47.370
have their own lives that's fine but you

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.200
don't have to try to like deconstruct

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.700
you're just doing yourself a disservice

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.460
by trying to like absolutely pull the

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.990
people's reality rug out from under the

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.009
feet I'm like you don't have to go that

00:29:56.009 --> 00:29:57.119
far you can say like look you guys have

00:29:57.119 --> 00:29:59.879
your thing I was born with a this is how

00:29:59.879 --> 00:30:00.929
the one girl explained it to me which

00:30:00.929 --> 00:30:02.610
makes sense like she's like you have to

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.440
think about it like yes there's penises

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.850
vaginas but there's also differing

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:07.379
hormonal profile someone might be born

00:30:07.379 --> 00:30:09.149
with so I'm like fair enough yeah

00:30:09.149 --> 00:30:10.350
actually said I'm like that's actually a

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.519
good answer I'm thank you for not being

00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:13.470
like a snide snarky did you say that oh

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:14.639
yeah I was like thanks for not being

00:30:14.639 --> 00:30:16.529
like a snide snarky personal remark

00:30:16.529 --> 00:30:18.539
because because people would like answer

00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:20.490
me and be like is it I solve the paradox

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:21.690
for you and I'm like actually no that

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.549
made no sense what you said dude it was

00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:25.860
a one-to-one you know I would I would

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.240
say something someone respond and I'd

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.259
like yeah no sorry

00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:30.570
next person comp dude it was so fun it

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.519
was louder with Crowder basically oh

00:30:32.519 --> 00:30:35.070
you're Crowder now I'll try not to be my

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.419
whole thing was like you guys should be

00:30:36.419 --> 00:30:38.639
able to [ __ ] at least and I said this

00:30:38.639 --> 00:30:40.649
as well I'm like I've never seen people

00:30:40.649 --> 00:30:42.840
so in equipped to deal with divergent

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.129
thinking I'm like you guys this is

00:30:44.129 --> 00:30:46.499
insane how bad the fact that I'm like

00:30:46.499 --> 00:30:48.990
being like well they're like biological

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:50.580
sex is a construct I'm like so you think

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.619
like I'm talking like back when we were

00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:53.999
like we were animals at a point do you

00:30:53.999 --> 00:30:55.379
think like when we were in an animal

00:30:55.379 --> 00:30:57.509
state we were like like since I'm like a

00:30:57.509 --> 00:31:00.299
guy I'm probably it was just like like

00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:02.429
it was literally not a social construct

00:31:02.429 --> 00:31:04.559
it was no it was how it was humans are

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:06.149
it was based off biology and hormones

00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:07.919
that you know and it's I'm like I'm not

00:31:07.919 --> 00:31:09.389
even making the thing like since that's

00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:10.769
the case you guys you guys gonna have

00:31:10.769 --> 00:31:12.330
whatever the [ __ ] you want you just

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.679
don't have to I'm like just for your own

00:31:13.679 --> 00:31:15.330
sake it makes you look like you're

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:16.679
[ __ ] nuts if you're trying to tell

00:31:16.679 --> 00:31:18.450
people like that's just like a made-up

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.340
thing that like obviously was invented

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.749
by white people it's like and I was like

00:31:21.749 --> 00:31:23.100
dude that's around the world go to

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.899
[ __ ] Africa and tell them talk about

00:31:24.899 --> 00:31:26.789
like male and women men and women you

00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:28.350
think people in Africa are gonna be like

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.029
actually we're black and we don't

00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:31.910
believe in men and women

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.760
it was dude it was so [ __ ] insane and

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.440
then like everything kept coming back to

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.350
like you know people then started coming

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:41.520

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.230
people and they're like I appreciate the

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:47.490
fact that he can bring this stuff up and

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:49.200
like I don't know maybe in our practice

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.910
like imagine you could come across a

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.920
trump supporter and I'm like dude if

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.870
your worst-case scenario of a person you

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.670
want to meet and like is a [ __ ] the

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:58.500

people so angry to come out and vote and

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.910
we're just living in the wake of a

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.070

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:33.970
I'm like dude this is [ __ ] crazy like

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:35.470
you guys are like out of your [ __ ]

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:36.329
minds

00:37:36.329 --> 00:37:38.890
just weird man to be like I might come

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:40.390
across a trump supporter I don't know

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:44.020
what I would do just [ __ ] relax dude

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.400
they I mean I think I've talked about

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.020
this before they talk about like if

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.900
there's a they're like well if we have

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.059
like a black kid there at our practice

00:37:52.059 --> 00:37:53.470
like I don't know if we should like we

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.029
should like really have to like examine

00:37:55.029 --> 00:37:57.309
that kids blackness with our whiteness

00:37:57.309 --> 00:37:59.740
it's like go talk to the guy man don't

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.510
be weird about it honestly I think that

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:03.039
whole thing of like well we have to

00:38:03.039 --> 00:38:04.390
respect their blackness I think it's

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:08.319
like a weird abstraction to keep like if

00:38:08.319 --> 00:38:09.580
you're like I'm calm

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:10.840
around black people but obviously is not

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.910
cool anymore you can now be like well I

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.500
don't want violate their blackness and

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.330
like you don't want to talk to black

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:17.590
people you feel weird that's one of

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.240
violate this so I'm gonna lock my car

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.500
doors when I drive through this

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.560
neighborhood well they're like maybe we

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.210
should diversify the staff so like they

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:26.530
have people they feel they can talk to

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.550
you like oh you wanna hire black people

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.100
to deal with black people okay

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:34.000
segregation its dude is crazy man and

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.530
we'll have a black department for the

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.390
black people to talk to they can talk to

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:39.490
the black department we should have all

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.440
black class yeah they feel safe yeah

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.930
they were and they were like dude I it

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.520
was so funny then people like well I

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.560
mean like I just feel like people get

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.120
amped up here because this is finally a

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.710
safe space for like people to be

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.540
themselves and I'm like yeah you know

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.550
safe spaces are exclusionary that's the

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:55.780
whole point of it is to exclude people

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.000
out yeah that's what a safe space is

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.950
it's just a euphemism for like and I'm

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.640
like honestly that's what basically

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.870
mainstream culture is technically a safe

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.550
space for those I should start calling

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:12.310
those camps but manged not a

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.960
concentration so dude I'm watching the

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.690
video we watched a [ __ ] MTV the

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:20.140
t-word or some [ __ ] for a class watching

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.360
MTV programming for the class oh my god

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.040
the t-word obviously I'm like excuse me

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.420
guys I'm obviously heavily triggered

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:29.470
right now they have like so they're like

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:30.700
yeah we finally have a space where it's

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.080
just like us and we're trans we can

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.610
finally just talk and be ourselves I'm

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.050
like that's what mainstream culture is

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.450
for the majority and then when people

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:38.830
come up with like hey what about us

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:40.990
they're like okay so like when I'm in a

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:42.910
the flip of that with a like a minority

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.860
save space bubble in terms of like

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.810
sexual minorities everything I'm like

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:49.450
what about this they're like ooh boo boo

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.040
and I'm like this it's just literally

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.590
the inverse of like you presenting your

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:54.910
[ __ ] to mainstream culture or like weird

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:57.190
boo get out of here it's weird but

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.480
obviously you know it's like yeah but

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.550
you're part of it bigger it's like yeah

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:04.210
dude definitely it's stood when I think

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.010
the the safe space stuff is funny

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:07.300
someone you guys realize it's just like

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.400
keeping people out it's not like it's

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.050
finally safe so you just exclude anyone

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.720
you're finally safe that's [ __ ]

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.100
ridiculous I was like yeah that's cool

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.240
if you guys want to do that but it's

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.530
just like you're just delaying the

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:18.670
inevitable when you go out in the world

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.380
and you just get [ __ ] absolutely G

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:23.109
shocked by like differences in opinion

00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:25.599
it was it was fun i I held core it was

00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:27.400
it was a blast I was like genuinely like

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.779
ramped up about it

00:40:28.779 --> 00:40:30.849
good I was like Jesus crazy it was

00:40:30.849 --> 00:40:33.069
having a room full of people to continue

00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:34.749
to strawman you and like well did you

00:40:34.749 --> 00:40:35.920
ever think about this it's like I'm

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.709
that's not what I said at all but yeah

00:40:38.709 --> 00:40:39.910
yeah that's pretty funny

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:41.440
it happens in standup oh dude it's

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.059
brutal here hunt stop someone's like

00:40:43.059 --> 00:40:47.650

and Savior J say about how I can I can

00:40:58.349 --> 00:41:00.670
sympathize with Pontius Pilate for

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:01.690
killing them on the [ __ ]

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:04.779
really dude sorry anyway I don't know

00:41:04.779 --> 00:41:06.369
I'm not gonna run bit by it but it is

00:41:06.369 --> 00:41:08.469
just how Jesus was like a dirty little

00:41:08.469 --> 00:41:11.650
shitty homeless Arab he wasn't like a

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.380
yoked hot guy sure he was definitely he

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.239

00:41:16.239 --> 00:41:18.519
- handsome dude it was like be kind it

00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:21.569
was just a homeless shitty Arab dude

00:41:21.569 --> 00:41:27.699
speaking shitty like what's his message

00:41:27.699 --> 00:41:29.799
what's his basically David Blaine he was

00:41:29.799 --> 00:41:34.979
David except he was like 4 foot 3

00:41:34.979 --> 00:41:37.959
everybody was a little tiny man first

00:41:37.959 --> 00:41:40.449
you're on around skinniest homeless and

00:41:40.449 --> 00:41:42.190
then hood what's his message and he was

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.949
like give money to the homeless people

00:41:43.949 --> 00:41:49.180
like me his messages give money to these

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:52.079
like you know who rules homeless guys oh

00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:53.979
yeah we figured that was his message

00:41:53.979 --> 00:41:56.709
[ __ ] kill him killer dude that's

00:41:56.709 --> 00:41:58.630
pretty for like just it's so funny to

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:00.489
think of that like Jesus's message back

00:42:00.489 --> 00:42:03.699
then yeah like as a [ __ ] weird random

00:42:03.699 --> 00:42:05.680
dude just being like and be nice to

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.069

00:42:10.779 --> 00:42:14.160
nice to [ __ ] sex worker positive

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.690
running the whole show we're like [ __ ] I

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:17.920
know they were just like you wait they

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.690
wanted the the other Jews want to kill

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.799
this one yeah sure yeah well I mean they

00:42:23.799 --> 00:42:26.259
were being the dude that's he it was so

00:42:26.259 --> 00:42:27.940
[ __ ] funny I was just I was driving

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.589
around it actually relates to this I'm

00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:31.719
driving around when I was picking up

00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:33.789
suicide I was hanging out 8 my little

00:42:33.789 --> 00:42:35.529
[ __ ] TV crawler dude the butterfly

00:42:35.529 --> 00:42:36.230
small

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:39.859
so I I'm driving around I was preparing

00:42:39.859 --> 00:42:42.020
for this class that I had to go to and I

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.050
was thinking about the whole the whole

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:47.030
presupposition that like we're all equal

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:49.099
just across the board we're all equal

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:50.960
like question that is it's wrong

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.530
obviously but it's also like I mean does

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.020
anybody like nobody believe that the

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.329
whole society was built around every

00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:00.800
group of people being like we're

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.720
obviously the best have you asked any

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.800
group people like yeah no we're the best

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.990
even if they're being crushed like the

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:08.150
Jews being absolutely but [ __ ] by the

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:09.859
Romans the Jews are still if you asked

00:43:09.859 --> 00:43:11.300
them back then they're like well no

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.619
we're in a kind of a glitch right now

00:43:12.619 --> 00:43:15.170
but we're definitely the best we're

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:16.430
gonna have a messiah that's gonna get

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:21.020
rid of these guys kill him that's like

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.369
that's been the Assumption forever that

00:43:22.369 --> 00:43:23.869
every group has been like no we're the

00:43:23.869 --> 00:43:25.760
best and like now they're like no no no

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.980
no nobody's the best but all the same

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.540
and everyone's like I see what you're

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.190
doing obviously still a [ __ ] bad yeah

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.680
every group is doing that yeah that's

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.910
like Asians like who's the best like

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:36.560
clearly we're the [ __ ] best I mean

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.510
they technically are the best of the

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:40.579
best if you let's say lads are high

00:43:40.579 --> 00:43:42.800
they're number one on the rankings I me

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.359
personally if you're if you're hit with

00:43:44.359 --> 00:43:46.430
like what I like but if you go with like

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:48.950
statistics who's women earnings yeah

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:51.140
agent ceiling it the partnership

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.190
partners are killing it but there's no

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:54.290
there's a real [ __ ] low end to that

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:56.900
spectrum to the Asians that are not

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:01.940
killing it oh here are not great you're

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.380
the ones that [ __ ] cross the finish

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.390
line and hit here hit America do well

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:07.579
yeah they're doing wonders still stuck

00:44:07.579 --> 00:44:10.280
in the [ __ ] back home that's a rough

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.579
go tough it's rough time yeah you gotta

00:44:13.579 --> 00:44:15.230
get over here dude hit minute yeah

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:16.880
they're well they're uh because

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.730
apparently they do the income is pretty

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.410
much related to education and Asians

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:24.020
have the most education per you know per

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.089
group obviously yeah but yeah apparently

00:44:26.089 --> 00:44:27.740
that that's that's what income that's

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:29.480
what income boils down to apparently

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.680
that's the [ __ ] I deal with they're like

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.140
in class or like there's a racial wealth

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.240
gap clearly it's like everything's a

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.819
white conspiracy it's like well if you

00:44:37.819 --> 00:44:39.260
look at the stats all the income is

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.730
related to education is I'm sure there's

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.050
been things that have [ __ ] people up

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.430
in terms of getting their education but

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.859
it's like all you have to do is a quick

00:44:45.859 --> 00:44:47.630
control for a couple other variables and

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:50.180
it's just like like when they do the FBI

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.100
they're like black people commit more

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:53.300
violent crime but if you hit it with a

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.280
multivariate analysis it's like well if

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.660
you control for education and

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.160
unemployment it's like all that crime

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.440
most the crimes being committed by high

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.850
school dropouts who are unemployed so

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:03.440
it's like it sounds like it but they

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:10.700
just true ballers everyone does that

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.440
they try to look at like they zoom so

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.700
far out and research and they're like

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.320
white people are the worst it's like

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.690
well let's [ __ ] control black people

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:18.770
the worse it's like more control for

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:20.300
this let's go obviously like if you have

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.070
education they did the same thing with

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.950
um what the [ __ ] was it they're saying

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:26.330
black they did a study that Nielsen

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:29.090
ratings of about like black consumer

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:31.100
goods and like they buy more like luxury

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.900
goods black people buy the most luxury

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.640
goods per capita but then when they

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.960
controlled white people it's all like

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.700
did just poor white people same [ __ ]

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.370
numbers bro but it's to me it is funny

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.410
how we're all being like did it had the

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:44.060
default it's like extreme pressure on

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.700
being no no nobody's the best we're all

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.210
equal and it's like like I'm thinking

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:51.260
like how many people in their heart of

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.240
hearts are actually like like I don't

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.350
really ever get hung up on that but I'm

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:56.660
laughing being like it's really it's

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.940
many other countries whipping out on how

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.580
new and recent this thing is that we all

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:03.140
are putting in practice and it's like

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:06.530
it's brand spanking new dude the fact

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:09.650
that like nobody's the best like that

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:11.540
isn't that any nationality ethnicity

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.940
anything yeah can't be like we're

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:15.770
obviously the best except sports I guess

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.870
or that like when they win you like told

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:20.060
you told you were the [ __ ] bastards

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.890

wars yeah if you like yeah sign this

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:30.470

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:31.700
it when I was in Spain there really

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.740

people be like white man your time is up

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.240
I was like I think you're off by like

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.609
three centuries if it's happening right

00:47:49.609 --> 00:47:49.930

select group of billionaires we're

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:02.600
propagandizing everyone would be like

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.590
well it's white people who are obviously

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.660
[ __ ] attacking you yeah

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:09.400

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.650
some those billionaires yeah though some

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:13.609
will say they're not white because

00:48:13.609 --> 00:48:17.390
they're Jewish but yeah yeah alright so

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:20.000

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:12.680
you're racist but everybody I mean I'm I

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.410
have the audacity to treat people like

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.840
they're adults exactly dude and this is

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.350
my thing

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:19.850
and this is what I mean I can't even

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:21.920
express this to the class I tried to

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.060
bring it up as much as I can

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:27.650
it's like black people / I would say

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:29.630
most minorities who like deal with any

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:31.640
kind of real issues would rather shoot

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.470
the breeze with a dude who's being

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:35.840
honest with them and you'd be surprised

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.980
how much they'd agree with you you have

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:39.170
to let them present it first though yeah

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:41.240
you have to let them open with it I

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.400
every time I see when I'm like here in

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.810
Westphalia if I see a black to him like

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:46.340
well how the [ __ ] do you guys cross the

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:48.770
street why do you cross the [ __ ]

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:51.230
street like that oh my god damn man you

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:54.740
crazy yeah that's how we do it I what

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:58.010
how do you have the [ __ ] mental

00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:00.350
stamina to block everyone else in the

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:02.000
world out to cross the street like that

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.070
I saw I did go ahead I just I was in

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.590
Brooklyn today yeah and I was just

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:11.570
complaining we were in the car

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:13.280
complaining that black dudes across the

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.050
street like that yeah an ambulance is

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:17.180
coming behind us stop a [ __ ] black

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.150
dude slowly walk sir sorry dr. strange

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.660
an ambulance son of a [ __ ] ambulance

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.970
he literally dr. strange like the car in

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:28.130
front of me was not pulling over and I

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.540
was like get the [ __ ] out of the way

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:31.250
like there's an ambulance clearly like I

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:32.870
was deep in that and then I saw black

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:34.220
dude emerged from the other side but the

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.080
car was stuck because the black dude was

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.940
slowly walking in front of it that's

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.440
insane amount of that would be funny if

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.090
that made it into like the Presidential

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:49.280
Debates I'm gonna say it I've wanted to

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.780
literally just like stop and be like

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.160

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.690
just trying to like ask you this

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:55.370
question are you doing that on purpose

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.590
because in some level it's gotta be

00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:58.820
satisfying to see a white guy and

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.160
rushing bees like in his [ __ ] slow

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:08.150
roll if someone honks at me I

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:10.370
immediately [ __ ] I'm like [ __ ] you

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:12.500
then and I slowed down so if there's a

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:14.390
psychological thing of like bro you

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:16.370
think you're controlling me the only

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:17.960
notice it cuz you're a white guy when it

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.700
happens they drew up to black it they do

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:20.930
it to each other not on this

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:23.090
black-on-black crime crossing the street

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.700
not to look out the window right now you

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.230

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.280
lot of [ __ ] autists yes especially

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.380
the ladies yeah if you're a female in

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:25.060

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.590
whole show I'm watching them like this

01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:31.660
lady Billie that's [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:33.040
like [ __ ] Nora and they at the very end

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.300
they're like by the way she [ __ ] died

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:46.060
it's great I don't know croaks after the

01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:50.200
JEP dude the I was talking about that

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.910
dude earlier who was doing all like the

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:53.560
trauma studies oh I heard that stat

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.620
about the witch i'ma call it like people

01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:58.630
being molested like maturing sex earlier

01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:00.430
apparently so that guy started like a

01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:02.590
whole trauma center with a bunch of

01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:03.850
different people to basically I treat

01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:05.980
people like who were molested war

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:09.070
veterans all of the [ __ ] and apparently

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:12.220
he got me too but dude I'm reading this

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.290
guy's a book and I'm like I find it

01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:15.790
surprising this guy was in here sexually

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:17.170
harassing people just like this guy

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:19.330
wrote like just this volume this [ __ ]

01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:22.180
book about like helping people get over

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:24.310
like traumatic experiences apparently he

01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:25.900
was like a ballbreaker like he expected

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:26.440
like

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.900
excellence hanging out with [ __ ] like

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:30.910
PhD psychiatrists and doctors and [ __ ]

01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:32.830
and he would have meetings where his

01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:34.720
whole company that the foundation was

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.430
structured like the stuff i've talked

01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:38.140
about where it's like but not really in

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.550
here in hierarchy you just go to

01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:40.870
meetings and like he'll be like here's

01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:42.880
how I feel you guys are [ __ ] up on

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.790
this we knew so [ __ ] hot good he said

01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:48.400
we need to do better on XY and Z so you

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.590
know so this thing's doing well it's so

01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:51.880
basically what happened was he had to

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.030
get um he went out to go get money to

01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:57.580
like keep he likes started this thing he

01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.080
raised a bunch of money was like 2.5

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.370
million dollars but then I I don't know

01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:02.500
exactly why I think for like insurance

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.420
or legal red tape he partnered up with

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:05.830
like a big medical

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:07.630
like institution I guess to be like an

01:13:07.630 --> 01:13:09.340
umbrella or a subsidiary of that thing

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:11.290
so he raised all this money and

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:13.840
apparently he found out that the the

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.130
people who were like in short like

01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:17.770
overseeing his foundation or this is

01:13:17.770 --> 01:13:19.600
what he says we're like yeah dude we're

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.730
gonna take that 2.5 million and we're

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:22.870
gonna do what we want with it and he was

01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:25.090
like get the [ __ ] out of here no like I

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:26.710
raised this you guys have your sauna use

01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:28.150
it on the wrong though like in those

01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:29.860
nonprofits they [ __ ] leech that money

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:32.530
it's crazy so he kind of spoke up I was

01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:34.630
like no so then he goes I come up I wait

01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:36.070
I wake up to basically a notification

01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:38.520
saying that I've been there's been a

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.010
allegations of me bullying and harassing

01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:44.500
female employees they're like we're not

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.150
gonna tell you who it was or what to

01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:47.500
what extent you were harassing whether

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.750
it was sexual or not but you're forced

01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:51.640
to resign immediately from thing that

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.890
you started and then he was like get the

01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:55.270
[ __ ] out here so he was like yeah dude

01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:56.440
they just took a bunch of money off me

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.460
and then he had a bunch of people he

01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:59.170
worked with write letters and

01:13:59.170 --> 01:14:00.940
testimonials big this is [ __ ] he

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.200
could he could be like tough at times

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.300
but it's like we're gonna [ __ ] we're

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:05.920
like a high paced medical environment

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.390
dealing with probably the toughest

01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:09.580
population you can deal with and it's

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.410
like insane and this they're saying he

01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:13.600
bullied employees and then the usually

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.920
were kicked off of the thing that you

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.680
started and the guy the dude who did it

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.360

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.520
bigger thing put hashtag me too in the

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.870

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:11.890
like molested by priests and it's it's

01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:13.570

his butthole in confession very MJ very

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:25.180
King of Pop the priest would be like

that the memory becomes like

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.590
inaccessible and there was a bunch of

01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:49.970
pushback against that because it was

01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:51.800

then General Patton was in the army

01:18:56.659 --> 01:18:58.940
those guys can when combined forces and

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:00.949
attack the troops and Hoovervilles and

then they like became president and like

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.659

01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:44.989
it's like everyone's expected to be like

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:47.510
I don't know dude gun down some rabbit

01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:49.400
holes watching shell-shocked videos

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.249
they're [ __ ] horrifying there's like

01:19:52.249 --> 01:19:53.780
studies in that day there was one dude

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.249
there's one that's like real famous is

01:19:55.249 --> 01:19:57.949
if if a guy saw a red hat he would lose

01:19:57.949 --> 01:20:01.340
his [ __ ] mind Jesus like terrified

01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:03.619
screaming hide under beds they would all

01:20:03.619 --> 01:20:05.030
hide under their beds and [ __ ] from the

01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:08.570
shells but if you showed this guy a red

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:10.880
ball or like a red hat he would just

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.710
lose his because he saw one of his it

01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:13.849
was a French dude and he saw his

01:20:13.849 --> 01:20:15.770
commander get his [ __ ] head blown

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:17.060
as wearing a red hat well apparently

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:19.070
they're saying is from the memory not on

01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:21.080
so you they haven't codified the memory

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:22.640
and language yet so they're they're

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.100
they're uh like their nervous systems

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:26.810
just activated like really activated

01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:28.220
they don't really know why and there's

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:29.630
buzzing around and then they'll see like

01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:31.040
a cue or something that reminds them of

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.600
it they just go and they freaked the

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.370
[ __ ] out like kind of don't know what's

01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:35.870
going on never like Freud kind of

01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:37.670
started yeah like helping the troops

01:20:37.670 --> 01:20:39.140
that was a talking cure they started

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:40.220
doing they started giving them the

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:42.290
ability to put their traumatic event

01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:44.480
into words and then build a narrative

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.010
that they could be like oh this is what

01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:47.360
happened to me and apparently that helps

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.160
so that was Freud and other guys they

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.660
started using hypnosis on him was like

01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:52.010
the big thing first and they're able to

01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:53.360
like talk about what happened there's

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:56.120
guys that like their shakes like it's

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:56.990
