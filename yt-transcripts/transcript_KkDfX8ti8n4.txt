WEBVTT

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.120
all right we're here we're on I'm with

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.759
my [ __ ] homie John as you guys

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.849
don't know him because this is a very

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.320
protected source what's up bro how you

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.849
know it

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.969
hey IP bad habit oh pretty good man I've

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.609
been very excited to talk to you I threw

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.550
out a little bat signal yesterday but

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.220
yeah I'm super stoked to talk to you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.340
about this yeah I just thought that last

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.810
night man you made me feel like a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.060
superhero kind of you know who you are

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.050
man you are

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.989
yeah yeah I don't feel like it sometimes

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.870
but yeah I guess in in some ways I'm

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.219
just trying to be a better citizen I

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.950
guess you know part of the society and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.670
try to help other people by making them

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.280
more aware of what's going on in the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.460
real world and not necessarily what they

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.879
might see on current in and on current

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.430
media that might be skewing their

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.820
perceptions of you know reality in some

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.950
ways because there's a really big

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.720
problem right now well that's what you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.100
were just saying you know sayings like

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.930
you feel bad for the average person that

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.150
just has to like turn on be like do i

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.549
watch fox or do i watch CNN like how do

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.380
you construct you down without kind of

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.360
just rolling your dice on one table or

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.049
the other so yeah yeah yeah it's hell is

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.740
that that yeah I I honestly can't even

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.079
imagine I've been in my kind of hole

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.750
that's my little sphere of influence for

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.280
for so long that uh the more I started

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.280
looking at I guess I guess I should go

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.340
back a little bit just just so you know

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.280
it's kind of aware of where I'm coming

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.259
from with all this stuff not since

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.020
nobody obviously know it's me hopefully

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.240
nobody knows but uh yeah so so basically

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.060
I happen to work in a field where I come

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.209
across lots of it's hard to say without

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.080
so let's just say that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.700
I work in a field where I come across

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.390
lots of information and lots of things

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.230
that have to do with events that are

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.540
occurring in the world and in the United

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.470
States and in society in general and and

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.890
a lot of the information and a lot of

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.010
the problems I see in the people I

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.550
interact with outside of my sphere and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.060
things like that yeah it seems like

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.910
people in general have a really skewed

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.720
view or of of what really is going on in

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.900
the world and and it's not necessarily

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.190
their fault because I don't think one I

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.820
don't think people in my world do a

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.330
really good job of sharing information

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.570
or or trying to help normal people to

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.630
understand the kinds of things that are

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.760
going on and at the same time it doesn't

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.180
help when one let me say up front I'm

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.550
not a politician I don't care about

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.120
politics I care about facts and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.940
informing people for for the types of

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.810
things that I do and so I don't really

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.239
care about conspiracy theorists theories

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.489
other than I think they're plenty and I

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.080
like joking about that kind of stuff we

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.830
joke about it all the time but so about

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.380
ten years ago I started on a kind of a

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.610
personal research project to see how

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.230
close I could get to what's actually

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.870
going on but just using open-source

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.790
information because if I if I use purely

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.190
open-source information then and

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.910
everything I share short of some things

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.070
because some things do make their way

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.709
into public knowledge when they

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.980
shouldn't and so I stay away from those

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.950
things but for the most part outputs can

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.810
I get to what is actually going on in

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.019
the world and then using purely

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.940
open-source information so it can be

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.459
shared and shared with other people so

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.680
people can then look into that

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.419
information and kind of inform

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.880
themselves and

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.690
and try to get a little bit more in tune

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.520
with with what's going on in the world

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.400
because these days one of the problems

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.150
these days is since people they only

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.090
have the information that it's in their

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.250
face and presented to them that that I

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.180
don't know the best way to describe it I

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.610
guess I guess I don't know how familiar

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.740
people are with just general information

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.810
warfare engine you know as a whole

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.910
basically at all because that that in

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.120
when you even say that people's uh their

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.980
you know the conspiracy theory alarm

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.120
start raining they've been training you

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.860
if you read the Atlantic's been

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.450
hammering on conspiracy theories and if

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.640
you even like yes any sort of

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.500
government's manipulating if I mean they

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.610
actually will say like China's

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.710
manipulating information Russia all this

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.720
stuff yeah so they kind of hint in it

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.130
but like they always are saying like

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.690
yeah but America doesn't do this at all

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.720
which again I don't know you know yeah

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.600
nah yeah no it I can say emphatically

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.020
and without a doubt everybody

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.500
does it to everybody else all the time I

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.320
mean by international international law

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.800
the espionage is legal and through

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.990
international law so which makes the

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.620
most sense

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.990
that's instead of like it's this good

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.430
guide this is a thing I started I don't

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.690
even cut you off is that you know I know

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.190
you're on a roll yeah don't worry this

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.530
is what happens please do it gets kind

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.730
of like you know this this stuff gets

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.870
you know you have the information you

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.130
have information what you have like you

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.740
know 360-degree informational warfare

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.030
and then you have so there's almost like

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.010
this nuns there's a huge aspect of the

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.540
narrative that's just you know bad

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.250
actors quote-unquote throwing and is

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.870
throwing mud in an obstacle you know

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.490
just kind of like muddying the waters

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.620
and then it's like you know you get like

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.580
say you get like something like

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.990
something comes out Hillary Clinton gets

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.000
doxxed then you hate Hillary Clinton

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.320
yeah and you go like oh well if the

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.210
person that I Docs the person that I

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.650
hate must be the good guy is like no

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.540
they might be an even worse guy you

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.860
don't even know who that is be him so

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.210
it's like you know it's just the with

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.340
human fallacy to be like you know the

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.170
enemy of my enemy is my Ally it's like

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.680
they could be even worse you know sorry

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.419
that's the ended up reading about the

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.210
hostile social manipulation stuff yeah

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.650
yeah yeah

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.509
that's a that's a great book and I sent

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:43.130
you a bunch more stuff that are just

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.860
different perspectives over the last few

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.650
years of the same kind of things and

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.800
there are more surveys of of these

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.550
research companies of all the countries

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.310
in the world and how they do it and what

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.620
percentage they do it and the kinds of

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.690
things they're doing but but information

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.210
warfare is is a huge thing but it's also

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.840
been going on probably as long as

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.479
there's been people honestly seeing us I

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:16.190
got you know we talked about on the news

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.580
you know everybody's been talking about

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.940
like Hillary Clinton with the Russia the

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.180
whole Russia election thing you know

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.100
that isn't a new thing that they

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.199
actually did I mean the Russians have

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.120
been doing that stuff since way back

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.479
early 1900s during Lenin's time you know

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:39.020
I mean it's just more it's just more

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.900
real time and more widespread and it's

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.560
way easier to do now where the cost of

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.530
being able to get affected by this stuff

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.080
is way less so like during the Cold War

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.150
times the KGB and and the precursors

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.150
that check and I believe it was the NKVD

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.750
before the KGB but anyway so so the way

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.720
that they used to do these just in

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.970
Russia terms but most countries are

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.070
pretty similar the way that they did

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.460
these kinds of operations were they they

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.639
just either they either went to that

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:18.620
country and turn people that were

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.620
sympathetic to their to communism or to

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.590
their cause and then they paid them you

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.380
know paid authors and playwrights and

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.630
magazine editors they would buy

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.690
publishing companies and book off you

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.459
know book publishing companies and

00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:36.800
magazine you know believe it or not

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.080
there's a magazine that I was surprised

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.430
to find out about that's been around

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.700
since like the 70s called Mother Jones

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.520
was that start I don't know if it still

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.380
is but but that was that was started out

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.680
as a KGB

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.710
funded project for influent I had no

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.250
idea but and honestly it that's all

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.290
described in a book that I continued the

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.600
title for it's it's pretty mind-blowing

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.200
it's from the highest the highest level

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.370
military operator from the old Soviet

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.190
Union that defected to the United States

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.010
about five years ago what's the book he

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.460
talked to all yeah let me look at my uh

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.480
my Kindle here real fast but uh yeah go

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.630
ahead sorry but in that same book ed

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.180
it's pretty crazy he actually talks

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.310
about the the truth of the Kennedy

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.090
assassination to was because he was

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.720
there he was that guy he was involved in

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.800
that stuff so the book is called well

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.050
strangely enough the book itself is

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.020
called disinformation is that we're

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.100
getting by uh so I go ahead good yeah

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.650
let me find that cover I can give you

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.350
that the guy's name is kind of hard to

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:09.250
pronounce but uh it's uh it's I own io n

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:14.930
mi h AI and his last name is P AC EPA

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.070
yeah give up on that it yeah but if you

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.710
search for yeah I don't know how to

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.870
pronounce it but the book is called gift

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.410
information former spy chief revealed

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.150
secret strategies for undermining

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.100
freedom attacking a religion and

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.820
promoting terrorism Jesus so this

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.380
lieutenant-general guy defected to the

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.690
United States and as part of those

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.360
things you know that's part of that deal

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.350
you pretty much are debrief by everybody

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.900
on the planet with a need to know and

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.570
and and that's your deal is you get to

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.140
stay here if you do that so I would say

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:59.120
that the book is definitely credible but

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.760
again it's hard to say and a lot of ways

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.360
because because everybody owns all sorts

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.800
of publishing companies and other

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.459
country

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:11.059
for for spreading propaganda and those

00:11:11.059 --> 00:11:12.709
kinds of things but he talks about

00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:15.800
Mother Jones and a lot of those things

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.869
because he was involved in those types

00:11:17.869 --> 00:11:20.990
of operations so yeah if you're ever

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.300
curious about that stuff it's pretty

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.329
eye-opening and books on the mitrik and

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:28.309
archive and I forget what the other one

00:11:28.309 --> 00:11:31.069
are these guys that dumped like hundreds

00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:34.160
of thousands of pages of documents from

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.069
the KGB secret archives and then brought

00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:38.929
them to the United States a lot of that

00:11:38.929 --> 00:11:41.300
stuff is it's pretty interesting too

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.449
if you're curious on how how what

00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:48.980
happened during the election with

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.809
Russian propaganda and what will

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:52.970
continue happening into the future has

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.279
been happening for a long time they're

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:57.679
just it's way easier to do it because

00:11:57.679 --> 00:11:59.839
back then during the Cold War and stuff

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:02.720
you know if you have you paid a guy that

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.089
that communist sympathizer to create a

00:12:05.089 --> 00:12:08.600
play that that is you know promote

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.149
communism to people that go to it well

00:12:11.149 --> 00:12:12.799
you had to be able to afford to go to a

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:16.100
play that to be affected by it and then

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.350
or you had to be able to afford to buy a

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.720
radio to hear a radio show of it or you

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.939
had to be able to read and be able to

00:12:22.939 --> 00:12:25.189
buy a newspaper or magazine or a book to

00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:28.069
be affected so the effectiveness that

00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:31.189
back then was yeah it was pretty

00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:33.980
effective but you know more just

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.799
people-to-people effectiveness that

00:12:36.799 --> 00:12:39.069
makes any sense yeah now it's way worse

00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:43.069
it's way worse because everybody has

00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:46.009
phones and tablets and computers and it

00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:49.309
doesn't really cost anything to get into

00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:53.779
that you know that that kind of field of

00:12:53.779 --> 00:12:57.350
being an actual target now sure I mean

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.089
even if it's in terms of like you know

00:12:59.089 --> 00:13:01.790
the way kind of digital society set up

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.170
where it's like you have you know it's

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.369
you know you can blast stuff out to

00:13:04.369 --> 00:13:05.809
everyone but you can also compromise

00:13:05.809 --> 00:13:07.610
what I did I didn't suspect you'd have

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:08.839
so you have like Russia or China or

00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:10.220
someone whoever you know we're us in

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.959
some other country you can just target

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:14.089
certain influencers and just try to like

00:13:14.089 --> 00:13:15.980
compromise them as well yep that's

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.149
something they talked about too or it

00:13:17.149 --> 00:13:19.639
worked you know you find a find the dirt

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:21.230
on somebody and you're like look ma'am

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.150
week this otherwise you do XY and Z and

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.920
you know now you're having someone talk

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.230
about what you wanted 35 million people

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.770
at once

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:31.550
pretty crazy oh my god yeah ya know just

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.090
about every country on the planet and

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.190
it's certainly possible that that we're

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.130
in that camp too that that yeah

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.640
everybody is looking for ways I forget

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.360
what the term is

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.760
offhand I believe it was my so if you

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.470
are looking to turn people in other

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.410
countries if that was your job then yeah

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.320
it's it's money the things that make

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.720
people turn and provide you information

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.090
on their current environment wherever

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.850
they are in the world is basically money

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.910
ideology coercion so being able to

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.130
blackmail people or get blackmail on

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:11.090
them ego I would throw in like sex fear

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.730
and embarrassment to change those things

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.450
I think and they get used all the time

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.570
because you know depending on how much

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.940
you want to know about other people or

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.580
and even now with just the internet like

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.360
some of the other stuff I do related to

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.970
trying to understand that mindsets of

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.480
the adversaries that are in our national

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.660
defense strategy and how they might come

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.410
at us when you get to when you start

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.000
playing you know like threat emulation

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.300
games and whatnot yeah a lot of that

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.920
stuff is super effective in people

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.550
falter stuff all the time yeah it's

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.840
funny business it's out of the it's

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.580
really tough it's unbelievable there's

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.160
how the operation infection thing you

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.510
know where they talk about one of the

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.550
ways especially in Russia they would if

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.720
you want to enter something in the

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.370
narrative it's like well you just pay a

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.140
third someone from the third world to

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.670
print it in some you know their

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.440
publications and then you go oh look at

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.670
this and then you throw it into your

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.500
publication and was funny because you

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.180
know little brother just sent me a thing

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.670
like a month ago about the cobia testing

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.960
he's like all this this you know this

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.930
guy in some country in Africa tried the

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.970
Cova tests on like an apple and it came

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.650
up positive so you can't really believe

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.060
them and it was like holy [ __ ] that was

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.650
exactly the thing that I read it's just

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.970
like you have someone from some like

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.200
country that it's like you know how does

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.060
anyone verify that you know nobody's

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.130
follows you know the Zambia times

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:34.640
remember

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.110
was I forget what it was it was just

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.120
like it was just like directly out of

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.980
that playbook and it was like wow that's

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.080
pretty nuts yeah how to present yeah

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.450
that's why I that's why I sent that one

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.640
to you because that one that one's still

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.600
for me pays off and how this kind of

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.520
stuff works because if you read through

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.370
that whole thing the way that played out

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.290
it's almost that you could say a

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.750
textbook example of what's happening now

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.170
between our interactions between the

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.510
United States or the West in general and

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.020
China I mean the the arguments being had

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.050
about Cove is 19 and it's or potential

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.100
organs is it is basically the same

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.630
playbook that was that was in that and

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.720
that was from the 82 yeah that that

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.880
stuff gets reused and reused and the

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.160
more you start digging into this stuff

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.770
and that's one of the things that from

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.210
my standpoint that gets kind of

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.950
depressing about this after a while

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.310
which is why I love you and change show

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.640
so much is because you know it perks me

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.560
back up again is is when you start

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.900
digging into it and you see like the

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.060
amount of this type of stuff that goes

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.550
on in the world and other super horrible

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.950
things that go on when you're trying to

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.810
understand other cultures and their

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.390
histories that try to think like them

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:57.080
and actually emulate adversaries in the

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.240
United States I mean when you're when

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.190
you're actually looking into that stuff

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.910
yeah it's everything that you look at

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.550
and you can't help but look at it from

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.480
that lens

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.540
okay what's the angle on this and so

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.610
who's the backer for that and what would

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:16.520
be their interest in providing that and

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.459
start to ruin everything from like

00:17:19.459 --> 00:17:21.860
watching TV shows to even watching

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.829
movies you know like you guys were you

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.020
and Shane were talking about what was it

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.410
the movie extraction yes traction yeah

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.840
and I don't I don't know anything about

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.540
the movie I haven't seen it but uh but

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.150
just based on your description

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.320
immediately when I heard and heard you

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.880
discussing that you know you were

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.920
talking about it was a like a US

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.820
military operative in India and you just

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.960
like you

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.750
no randomly shooting a buncha Indian

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.450
soldiers and stuff like that so so

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.570
immediately just based on that the first

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.059
thing that pops into my mind is eight I

00:17:59.059 --> 00:18:02.630
thought that was backed by by a Chinese

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.399
media company or something like that

00:18:04.399 --> 00:18:07.039
because that is a great propaganda piece

00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:10.220
that people will eat up and it's not

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.010
it's not in-your-face propaganda but it

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.750
does influence your thinking a little

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.990
bit where where you have and it falls in

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.390
line with and this is not conspiracy

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.610
stuff in those other documents I sent

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.460
you this is what people get trained to

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.580
do there's entire groups and and stuff

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.950
where this is their job they're trained

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.620
to do this kind of stuff but uh but yeah

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.289
so for that movie that military you know

00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:38.029
there's arguments right now between

00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:42.110
China and India and India is like

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.809
because it's population is you know

00:18:44.809 --> 00:18:47.120
similar in size to China those are the

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.010
two biggest populations on the planet

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.980
everybody in the West wants India on

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.570
their side there's a counterbalance

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:58.070
supposedly to China and so if you think

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.460
about it in that sense yes I would bet

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.500
that if you went all the way back to see

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.500
who-who the original source funders in

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.350
the way way back honor for that movie

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:13.960
probably is someone in in China or with

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.270
connections there because it's it's an

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.059
American soldier that just shows up in

00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:22.490
India and starts killing Indian soldiers

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.429
and and that would be in China's

00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:27.710
interest to you because they want to

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.429
show India this is what America is like

00:19:30.429 --> 00:19:32.750
America do shows up and start shooting

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.419
people with no reason and without

00:19:35.419 --> 00:19:37.640
following the rule of law and their

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.620
national law just can't actually do that

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.020
you know yeah that show up in a country

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.909
that start shooting people and nobody

00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:45.559
gets mad at you yeah yeah the helicopter

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:46.940
comes and again there was I remember

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.470
people be like I think it was like it

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:49.520
might have been India it might have an

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.230
impact I said I think I swear god I

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.280
think it was India but

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.080
regardless I understood point makes

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.550
sense and it's like yeah and the movie

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:56.960
was ridiculous where it's like this guy

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.010
wasn't even Italian

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.810
this is private military this guy wasn't

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.340
even affiliated with the actual military

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.050
he was just like a mercenary [ __ ] yeah

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.090
I can get away with just like shooting a

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.620
million Indian police officers and

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.970
military officials and getting out yeah

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.400
yeah that's uh yeah sorry go ahead

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.630
so it's possible it's possible that that

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.730
you know it's just a movie and it just

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.250
happened to be that way but those kinds

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.940
of things are in a lot of things and

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.300
mostly and and this isn't conspiracy

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.120
stuff I mean if you if you spend the

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.340
time to look into it about what these

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.040
groups and these information warfare

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.710
groups from other countries or have been

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.990
doing for decades and what they get paid

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.450
to do is that kind of stuff you don't

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.670
want to shove it in their face that you

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.710
know I'm we're better than them even

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:52.550
though in my opinion we do that right

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.690
now with our current administration

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.330
which but other countries are very

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.640
subtle about it and so your perception

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.400
of things changes over time I mean from

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.980
the RAND Corporation and a couple others

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.970
these research outfits have to do with

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:14.180
manipulating populations and mindset for

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.630
propaganda they did have to dig it up

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.490
again I don't remember the exact numbers

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.480
but it basically was they looked into it

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.690
and most of the media companies and

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.880
things like that in the United States

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.960
are owned supposedly again this is based

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.330
on research I just read I haven't

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.600
validated any of it myself but but most

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.060
of the entertainment and media companies

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.260
are their primary shareholders are from

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.550
from China and so this research group

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.640
then went back and you know having found

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.500
that so they went forward to see how

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.920
that plays out with with the products

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.750
that come out from these countries over

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.770
time and and supposedly if you go back

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.730
and look at their list of movie

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.730
that like if there was a Chinese

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.590
character in it they're never the bad

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:15.330
guy what was it they're never there

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.060
never the bad guy and if anything

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.960
they're always like the the benevolent

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.590
person or they are the hero or in line

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.550
or in the group with the heroes but then

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:31.380
countries in the West if it's a movie

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.420
that has a collection of people from

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.170
throughout world then the way the people

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.120
of the West are typically the ones that

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.970
cause the problems and then you know

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.570
China is the one or that you know

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.520
Southeast Asian or aging countries

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.710
they're the ones that have to then fix

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.920
the problem that that you know creates

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.490
this good outcome for for the movie so

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:58.170
and you look at that and it's like look

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.170
even if it that their sources are kind

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.240
of shaky I totally I totally would

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.250
believe it because that is how this

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.260
stuff works

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.730
yeah I mean even though I've read stuff

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.110
about like you know some of the measures

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.340
even being like you were saying it's not

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.750
as in your face is like you know they're

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.430
gonna like I don't have a movie or like

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.720
oh you know trying to rules China is

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.070
awesome or you know Russia rules Russia

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.900
is awesome whatever it's like you they

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.550
just kind of sit and observe like

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.860
certain areas of friction in like

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.210
different societies so you know in

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.710
American society they can do there was a

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.360
black you might divide there's the

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.040
people of color white people there's

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.590
males versus females blah blah you know

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:32.970
and then you kind of start digging into

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.350
that and it's like yeah that'd be super

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.610
easy to like you know you have money

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.020
influence you get Netflix oh I've

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.910
noticed i watch the Netflix movies with

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.980
with my wife and I'm she gets mad at me

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:41.760
cuz I'm like dude this is like

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.740
borderline propaganda where I'm watching

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.110
it not a narrative and I'm like this

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.030
seems like veer and again maybe

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.800
someone's just trying to score like cool

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.840
cool artist points but it seems like

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.470
intensely and very intentionally kind of

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.330
digging in hitting a nerve on purpose

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.920
like a you know one over and over and

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.570
over yeah over again it's like you know

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:02.130
yeah it makes sense so if you own

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:03.990
Netflix or on the board yeah it makes

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:05.190
sense that there would be some you know

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:06.900
I level money or influence who's like

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.070
hey we need you know what we want to get

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:09.660
this made and that would probably get

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.770
made over and again I mean I mean in the

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.780
more you dig into this stuff and it's

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.450
not just on other countries doing it to

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.039
the United States

00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:22.739
and the West itself we do it to other

00:24:22.739 --> 00:24:24.869
countries because it's super effective

00:24:24.869 --> 00:24:28.889
and and also we do it to ourselves just

00:24:28.889 --> 00:24:31.499
as other countries do it to themselves

00:24:31.499 --> 00:24:36.239
kind of definitely you know floods their

00:24:36.239 --> 00:24:38.159
their media and Russia and all these

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:40.070
other countries flood their media with

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:43.649
propaganda to for their own citizens and

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.570
we do the same for presidential

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.460
elections and even just regular

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.769
marketing and advertising for selling

00:24:49.769 --> 00:24:52.619
products and if if you ever sit down and

00:24:52.619 --> 00:24:54.690
talk to like a person that is a

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.359
marketing or advertising person it's

00:24:57.359 --> 00:24:59.729
terrifying what they actually talk about

00:24:59.729 --> 00:25:02.399
where they actually hire psychiatrists

00:25:02.399 --> 00:25:04.529
and psychologists and stuff like that to

00:25:04.529 --> 00:25:08.309
understand what it is that that would

00:25:08.309 --> 00:25:11.340
make something more make a person more

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.249
likely to buy their products over

00:25:14.249 --> 00:25:15.809
somebody else's product and then they

00:25:15.809 --> 00:25:18.809
tailor that stuff weather imagery or

00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:21.599
colors or something like that and you

00:25:21.599 --> 00:25:23.429
start reading some of these books for

00:25:23.429 --> 00:25:27.749
for social engineers that's like a group

00:25:27.749 --> 00:25:29.999
of if if you're not familiar with out at

00:25:29.999 --> 00:25:31.679
all it's basically a group of people

00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:35.729
that that get paid to to like break into

00:25:35.729 --> 00:25:39.659
places so that to help companies get

00:25:39.659 --> 00:25:41.999
better at their security for how people

00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:44.659
might try to get into their companies

00:25:44.659 --> 00:25:47.159
but yeah you talk to some of the social

00:25:47.159 --> 00:25:50.489
engineering guys and the research they

00:25:50.489 --> 00:25:53.220
do when they're like they've been hired

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.119
to go after a company a and um one of

00:25:57.119 --> 00:25:59.249
the favorite stories is there was a

00:25:59.249 --> 00:26:02.159
casino in Vegas that hired a particular

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:06.299
group to play adversaries for their

00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:08.639
organization and when they started doing

00:26:08.639 --> 00:26:11.190
research on it I mean holy crap it was

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:14.609
it's down to like the noises that are

00:26:14.609 --> 00:26:16.349
made inside that they are like people

00:26:16.349 --> 00:26:18.960
winning a lot of times that's not real

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.269
people those are actual audio that's

00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:24.210
played when the amount of money being

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:30.749
one is low that they have audio of you

00:26:30.749 --> 00:26:32.340
know things paying out and whatnot that

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.810
get played and the color

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.150
that are inside of there and the

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.340
lighting the way the lighting is and

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:42.390
that the layout and even the smelled of

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.120
stuff all of it is there to entice you

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.160
to be more comfortable and spend more

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.980
money and stay long so you're looking to

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.410
just more of that kind of stuff and the

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.660
video games on your your social media

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.730
and and and the advertisements

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.040
themselves but all of that stuff is

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.550
there to kind of Pavlov doggy and to

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.490
stay in there longer which get your face

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.860
in front of more of advertisements and

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.610
things like that so yeah the

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.710
manipulation of societies is I mean it's

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.350
a definite real thing and everybody uses

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.950
it

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.020
for good in for bad purposes I mean

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.570
maybe people as far as marketing and

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.480
advertising go maybe people want that um

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.000
they want they want you know these

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.550
companies to to know what they want so

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:31.350
they don't have to think about it but I

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:35.490
don't know it's pretty straight and no

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.380
it's horrible there's a terrifying thing

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.520
to as you say that it's like you know

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.380
again with the casinos and you know how

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.270
a lot of the social media companies use

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:45.060
the same tools that casinos use to make

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.100
yeah as addictive as possible but the

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.200
middle you know the social media company

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.720
is simultaneously addicting you keeping

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.370
you longer and the longer the longer

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.600
you're there and using those platforms

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.580
the more data they're extracting from

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.980
you making the platforms and stickier

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.990
and stick here over time so it's like

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.450
yeah it's yeah actually that being used

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.640
to message that information then being

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.460
you know gotten by different regimes I

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.200
want to kind of target you know America

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.820
or whatever country so then it's like

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.830
people are just given away all this

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.200
information that can doesn't always not

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.580
like it is definitely but it can be

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.230
weaponized and using ways to completely

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.650
manipulate and distort perceptions

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:27.420
it totally is I mean people people that

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.180
didn't threat emulation red teaming and

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.940
things like that or companies give them

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.820
the they give them permission to do that

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.160
to their companies to emulate

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.740
adversaries and and go after their

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.140
companies to kind of test their defenses

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.470
and monitoring like that so that if when

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.730
real adversary

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.360
do it then hopefully they they thought

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.040
of all of the things when they were

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.390
faking it you know but yeah use a crap

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:01.050
out of LinkedIn and Facebook and and and

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.950
all of those two to get information

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.390
young and if you're if you're playing an

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.060
adversary and company and this is legal

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.790
and a company hired hires you to do this

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:14.460
and as part of your rules of engagement

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.950
and so if you're looking for your play

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.480
an adversary and you're looking for

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.720
targets dude you're looking at job

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.370
postings you're looking to what

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:26.270
information your if your target

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.320
organization is putting out saying that

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.510
they want would they'll tell you what

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.880
sometimes what what types of software

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.640
they use and what types of networks they

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.560
have and and then people on LinkedIn

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.750
love talking about where they work and

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.320
the things they do and and whatnot and

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.790
everybody is linked to everybody else so

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.950
you can pretty much map out most

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.920
companies just based on Facebook and

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.730
LinkedIn connections yeah and then and

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.900
then just and mine all that information

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.410
because for for passwords because most

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:03.840
people when they're making passwords for

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.930
their email or or for their social media

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:09.240
in general now if you're playing real

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.820
adversary and and this stuff is in your

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.000
rules of engagement then typically I

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.790
mean it's possible that uh that I've

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.310
done it and it works more often than not

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:27.330
where you get to you get somebody to be

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.040
your friend or link to you on that

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.410
LinkedIn or on my Facebook is my

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.620
favorite but if you do it on that you

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.750
have access to them and their friends

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.880
then you dump the information up it

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.910
based on whatever your target is there's

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.160
tons of free applications I make it

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.100
really easy you dump that raw text and

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.040
more often than not their password is

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.040
somewhere on their Facebook site just

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.010
it's just a word or something that they

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:59.220
have said and and yeah more often than

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.170
not you just dump the text off so

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:01.660
they're in

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.840
put it into single words or run it to an

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.000
algorithm that kind of mix and matches

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.060
cases and add symbols and stuff and a

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.070
lot of times you're getting into stuff

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:15.910
so so yeah people given stuff away there

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.700
are bad people that use this stuff like

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.450
crazy and it's super effective and super

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:26.350
effective too to give adversaries a view

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:29.620
into personal things on if they're

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.770
targeting somebody for a phishing attack

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:35.920
specifically people put tons of personal

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.660
information out there and then that

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.140
gives you the ability to craft really

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.630
personalized phishing messages that hit

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:47.860
them and then they're totally I hate I

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.360
hate that bit to say how often it works

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.720
but it is really effective but uh you

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.000
guys get a little bit of personalization

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.220
in there and maybe add the name of a

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.990
friend or something that's on their

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.600
Facebook site or you know put in at a

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.760
picture that was from their site and

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.310
immediately it does it they'll give you

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.460
whatever you ask for Jesus maybe I think

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.100
you're supposed to be there yet so all

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.500
of that stuff is what people need to be

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.840
more aware of like phishing is super

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.350
effective because of that we're yeah in

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.300
some ways and AB written papers on it

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:29.140
and and done some like internal talks

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.150
not big public talks because those

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.870
freaked me out but uh I put internal

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.550
talks where we're in some ways that

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:42.360
everybody in the United States needs to

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:48.670
to think of so you know everybody used

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:50.470
to talk about during the Cold War about

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.720
World War three you know blah blah blah

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:57.070
and and I mean technically you could say

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:01.150
it happened but it started back in 1990

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:04.780
and it's never stopped we're we're we're

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:08.440
the advent of internet and people being

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.480
more interconnected is super awesome

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.880
because it's you know you can it's

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.740
convenient and you can connect with

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:15.130
people

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:16.870
more there's more business and

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:19.210
opportunities and stuff like your radio

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.610
show and this conversation now sure

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.150
austrack way back when what are the what

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.890
are the chances that that we would ever

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:28.930
meet and be able to talk about stuff

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:31.180
like this I mean I'd rather be way more

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.940
difficult if it wasn't for it wouldn't

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.800
be possible to supply open-source

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.840
information to people at this and so

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.150
there's benefits but at the same time

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:43.210
it's been opened up the battlespace so

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.840
pretty much every person has a device or

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.690
interacts with a computer or the

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:52.480
Internet in general is now a target and

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.000
you're part of the battle phase she's

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.060
had that battle phases is information

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.750
warfare so I mean ransom just think of

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.030
all of the things that you see on the

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.310
news or earth I guess I see it and they

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.350
knew that I don't know about nor with

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.970
people I stopped watching normal news or

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:11.590
paying attention to it a long time ago

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:16.889
but but basically basically one of the

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:20.350
ideas of this paper or these papers that

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.720
are written is is that people need to

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.830
think of it more that everybody is is if

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:29.080
there is a war going on and everybody's

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.510
in it they just don't know it or don't

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.070
realize it because it doesn't get

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.250
discussed very much when you're talking

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.889
sorry sorry sorry I'm so excited all

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.460
right no you you no no definitely

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:45.040
definitely just just jump in wherever

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.129
you want because I have a tendency to

00:34:47.129 --> 00:34:50.290
just start talking and so I always tell

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:51.700
people totally interrupt me because

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.040
sometimes they get on a roll and really

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.350
you're on a mega roll dude and I'm not

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:58.330
mad at it what I'm saying is it okay

00:34:58.330 --> 00:34:59.890
brought up this idea of people what does

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:01.660
it mean then for people now to be a

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.520
citizen excited that's almost that can

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.530
be a dirty word yeah now you use it it

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:07.390
can be like oh you you know if a citizen

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.430
could be like I watch CNN and I you know

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.110
I did I do what they tell me to do it's

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.690
orange level I yeah and then it could be

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:15.700
like you're like I'm here more like you

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.320
know or like are you a citizen where you

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.730
can look at that deck alright that's

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.790
some weird WWF stuff yeah you know I

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.620
don't yeah I should watch and kind of

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.270
listen to parts of it but being a

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.220
citizen of informational warfare where

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.030
it's like you know yeah

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.590
right in my opinion it's like let me try

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.570
to bridge these gaps between people and

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.450
these stupid unnecessary ideological

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.420
gaps and now have kinda fractionated the

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.310
population we're like this is a bad like

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:42.140
we're in a bad way and almost we're

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.380
playing into I would say the hands of

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.300
people who are probably have really bad

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.090
stuff planned for us that accurate a

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:53.090
hundred yeah hundred percent and it's

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.820
unknown what the interests of this in

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.470
the United States what all of these

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:00.110
places are but most of the time it's

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.560
it's nothing I mean short of things like

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.480
what your what I'm seeing on the news

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.280
about that EPS being guy and his

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.670
girlfriend but but short of that most of

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:13.940
it is just is just people want to be

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.960
famous and in money I mean if you look

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.440
at the news and I've written some papers

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.810
on it and given some briefings on it as

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:26.390
well where you look at the news and it's

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:30.230
not necessarily it's not that it's fake

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:34.190
news I mean I can't say that as a whole

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.930
because obviously I can't watch all the

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:38.570
news all the time but of the things that

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:42.320
I have seen recently on on normal news

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.530
like your CNN and MSNBC s and foxes and

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.200
stuff it's not that it's fake news it's

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.860
just it's presented it's not presenting

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.950
the entire picture like the context of

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:57.140
this particular thing we're talking

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.120
about and what you're seeing is also

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.700
just opinions it's not actually facts

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.590
there's they're not necessarily

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:07.400
reporting just pure unvarnished facts

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.310
with no bias I mean you got to think

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:12.290
that these when you so if I'm thinking

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:16.250
of it from if I was an adversary and I

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.950
wanted to control a narrative in country

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:21.440
like the United States would say so I'm

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.390
an adversary country and I want to

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:27.010
control the narrative there and either I

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:32.090
either I induce the owner or a major

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:34.070
shareholder from one at least news

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.620
organization and get them into a

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:39.190
situation where you could blackmail em

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.990
or you just offer them tons of money

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.890
because

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:46.280
love time demonic through or for you or

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.010
if you just have tons of money because

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.890
you are a country and you can do

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:53.330
whatever you want with the country's

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.520
money because in most countries outside

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.830
of the United States that's pretty much

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.890
how it works you can become the major

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:02.810
shareholder in some of these countries

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:07.400
and and this is is and has been done you

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.100
can it then as major shareholder because

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.500
you're CNN's and Fox this isn't stuff

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.650
they have to to answer to shareholders

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:17.270
you know the way that the whole thing

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.570
works is you're provide a product but

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:22.970
you only you only have a product and I

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:24.650
only have people selling your product

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.050
because you have advertisers that's how

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.570
you pay everybody and those advertisers

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:32.360
then they they want lots of views and

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.490
they want lots of return on investment

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.770
well of these same news organizations

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.350
then our businesses that have a board of

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.780
directors and shareholders so if I

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:45.530
wanted to control that hypothetically

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:47.690
I'm definitely in no position to do this

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:49.580
and I wouldn't I'm just talking

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.920
scenarios sure of course but if I was in

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.950
a I was an adversary become the major

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:56.630
shareholder of one of these companies

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:59.870
and then and then make them do it

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.360
because you could withhold or withdraw

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.580
your money and and hurt these companies

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.430
and other shareholders you know your

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:09.590
moms and pops I own stock and some of

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.050
these companies they want to make a

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:13.520
return and if they're not they can

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.170
return then they're going to bail and

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.990
then that company loses money so it's in

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:21.200
their interest that to have sensational

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.390
stories that drawing viewers which gets

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.490
more advertising and more money for

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.200
advertising which increases viewership

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.380
and makes shareholders happy so that's

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.720
their interest so it I in my opinion

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.940
people need to look at at these products

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.450
is more in that way where what are they

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:44.000
interests if I'm watching a news program

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.540
instead of just accepting everything

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.850
that's on that news program or that

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.539
media service in general

00:39:53.539 --> 00:39:56.930
you know that's my team and and you know

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:59.359
I'm with them and all the time yeah

00:39:59.359 --> 00:40:01.930
these other weird reasons that people

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:05.089
congregate in these little groups you

00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:07.760
have to look at it as citizen as a

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.160
person and as a citizen these days as

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.279
I'm looking at this this particular

00:40:13.279 --> 00:40:16.180
service this media service or whatever

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:19.190
what are the interests of this service

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:23.450
and what controls that those interests

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:25.640
and then how does that affect or how

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.289
could that affect the news that I'm

00:40:27.289 --> 00:40:29.240
seeing and when you start to look at

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.010
things in that way because that's how

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.319
our ever series are looking at these

00:40:33.319 --> 00:40:38.329
things and that it's it'll give you more

00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:40.970
of that I don't know and maybe it's just

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:45.289
me but it it kind of makes you want to

00:40:45.289 --> 00:40:48.250
try harder to figure out what the actual

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:51.020
stories are for these things and you

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.450
know so if you're telling me that you

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:57.200
know I can't think of any examples off

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.760
and but well think about that I can give

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.349
you all you need to think about Fox you

00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:01.760
know Fox News you know and again I'm not

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.069
demonizing or singling out Fox News it

00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:05.420
was one that I was paying attention to

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.279
different Wow felt myself getting kind

00:41:07.279 --> 00:41:08.930
of like orbited into where it was like

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:10.339
you know what I was like let's sing

00:41:10.339 --> 00:41:12.079
Dalek Jones just like laughing at it

00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:14.029
like I was kind of funny then I started

00:41:14.029 --> 00:41:15.170
catching myself becoming like

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.789
sympathetic towards Russian causes

00:41:16.789 --> 00:41:18.710
weirdly I was kind of like yeah yeah and

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:20.059
they got kind of screwed over by NATO

00:41:20.059 --> 00:41:21.140
and I was like you know what I'm like

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.809
it's good Trump's talking to right like

00:41:23.809 --> 00:41:28.160
you know what he should yeah yeah and

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.039
that and honestly that's how it works I

00:41:31.039 --> 00:41:33.079
mean when you're talking information

00:41:33.079 --> 00:41:35.539
warfare if you're not talking straight

00:41:35.539 --> 00:41:40.490
facts that's how it works is is you just

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.529
control the narrative and influence

00:41:42.529 --> 00:41:45.109
people enough to push them in one

00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:48.490
direction or another and then and then

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:51.529
just the way that it seems like we are

00:41:51.529 --> 00:41:54.770
as people insist you know in you know

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:57.230
American society today we're more

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.539
inclined than if you just nudge people

00:41:59.539 --> 00:42:02.470
in a certain direction then boom

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:05.510
groupthink kicks up and and suddenly

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.560
there's

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.190
whole big you know dust-up over that

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.680
thing or there's a new group that is

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.800
angry over that thing instead of you

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.800
know those people going okay that sounds

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.250
pretty crazy so so what it what is the

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.290
truth behind its or what are the facts

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.960
behind this before I let my you know I

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.390
get myself all spun up over this mm-hmm

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.730
and and one of my favorite examples

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.040
right now and I've been talking about it

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.120
a lot just because it's on it's one of

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.520
one of the adversaries that's listed in

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.590
the national defense strategy and and

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:45.560
that's China and China certainly is a

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:51.190
competitor and China certainly has has

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:55.780
committed espionage on a grand scale all

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:59.090
motives - work to a tiger sorry I have

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:00.530
to ask you that some people like all

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.060
China's a paper tiger they don't have

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.210
any that's [ __ ] then oh yeah no

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:09.020
China has definitely done a ridiculous

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.480
amounts of things and stolen a

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.610
ridiculous amount of stuff from the

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:17.990
United States sends the 70s well I mean

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:22.190
there's a book called tiger trap that

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:25.520
that anybody can get I mean I just read

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.030
it and and was you know blown away by

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:33.710
how pervasive and how how honestly how

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.620
awesome they are at it and and so much

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.660
better than everybody I mean you have to

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:42.890
appreciate the commitment to the game

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:45.020
that they have and how really good it

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.030
they are at it I mean way back in the

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.940
70s in that book Tiger traffic they

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.120
basically that there was the this thing

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.240
called or one of the warheads I mean

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.650
it's in a book so it shouldn't be a big

00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.510
deal but there was some nuclear

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.030
information that was stolen and nobody

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:04.430
knew how and nobody found out about it

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:08.030
until 10 years later and then they only

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:09.860
found out about it because there was a

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.350
guy in China that was working totally

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:14.390
for the Ministry of State Security

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.880
he saw all of this stuff he didn't like

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.530
what was happening in China so we put

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.300
her on the duffel bag chucked out

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.100
a window and then walked out that it

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.410
walked out of this highly secure

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.020
building and grabbed that duffel bag and

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:31.310
walked into a chief of station and and

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.760
gave it to him and everybody from CIA

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.360
FBI everybody looked at it and they

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.750
couldn't believe that that their luck

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:44.030
that they had this stuff and this is in

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:47.810
the 70s when there were no internet or

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.940
computers and things weren't as easy as

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.030
they are now and nobody believed it and

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:55.430
and they thought this guy must just be

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:57.020
full of crap he was just looking for

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:57.800
asylum

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.110
so nobody did anything with it and then

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.570
a few years later similar thing happened

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:04.790
and it came up again and then one of the

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:06.530
guys that actually authored one of the

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:08.420
papers that was in that original thing

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:12.050
is like dude that's real stuff because I

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.720
wrote that and then it blew up and do

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.600
this whole cake thank so you know they

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.340
have been takin stuff for a super long

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:23.150
time but in some ways so have we I mean

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:26.630
if if anybody is ever interested and

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:30.530
want to know in how will one when the

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:32.390
United studio before there was a United

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:34.910
States when people came here from from

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:37.190
Great Britain I mean they came over and

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:39.860
we brought knowledge and technology with

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.920
us that was theirs and then we expanded

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.500
it so and then at the same time at the

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.710
end of world war two if you look up I

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:52.430
believe it's a book to or somebody an

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:54.620
investigator just wrote a book about it

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:58.070
called Operation Paperclip but basically

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:01.910
we have we have a NASA and we have

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:05.390
missiles and a rocket program and I

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:08.660
believe even nuclear weapons but I could

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.430
be wrong on that one but we definitely

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:13.160
have a lot of the things we have from a

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.660
military and a space research standpoint

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:23.750
because of in we brought in or allowed

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:28.370
on Nazis end of World War two to detect

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:30.410
to the United States and then we wiped

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:32.750
their slates clean as long as they would

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:33.810
do it for us

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:37.350
so you could say in that way we wish we

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:39.870
just did a pike we have people that are

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:41.700
probably going to get the death penalty

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.850
somewhere but instead we wanted what

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:46.620
they knew so they came over here and did

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.990
it for us like lots of medical advances

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:52.140
and we took advantage of that so I think

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.330
it's awesome because I live here and I

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:58.560
entire previous career revolved around a

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.710
lot of those in dancing so so I'm happy

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:03.990
about it and I want us to win because I

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:06.600
live here and I think the United States

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.640
is awesome but at the same time we can't

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.670
say that other countries are so very bad

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:13.980
because they do it and we don't do it

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.860
because everybody does it everybody all

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.280
the time yeah I mean if that makes any

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:20.670
sense

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.140
it just makes way more sense than this

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.020
again these things tend to be like spun

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.640
into these narratives with you know you

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.070
yeah like I'm thinking more of like I

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:30.750
mean it happens with whatever you know

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.130
any of these kind of things where it's

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:34.320
like you know there's a binding is a

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.300
good guy Trump's a bad guy Trump's the

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.250
good guy by the deep state of the bad

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:40.230
guys it's like or it's just a bunch of

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:42.180
like you were saying more so like a

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.800
bunch of countries locked in kind of

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.350
total war for long periods again where

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:47.970
everyone gets kind of you Falls a time

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:52.170
no yep so and the only difference is

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:55.070
instead of having two militaries that

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:58.110
volunteered for the most part in some

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:01.830
countries not but two militaries

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:03.780
fighting each other and they are

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.060
supposed to buy a body you know the

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.240
rules of law or rules of war they're

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.460
supposed to leave civilians out of it

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.280
it's supposed to be politics by force

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.410
which means two militaries fight each

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:20.670
other over politics um and but it's not

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.910
anymore and and that's the the mindset

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:27.060
that I think needs to be and what I'm

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:30.510
kind of hope are trying to do with with

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.220
talks like you know talking to guys like

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.950
you and and these research projects over

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:37.620
the last 10 years is is in some ways

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.730
everybody needs to think of themselves

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:46.020
think of the world in general as a giant

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.380
massive information

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:52.839
warfare speech and they are a target all

00:48:52.839 --> 00:48:54.730
the time as long as they're using a

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:56.380
device and infant if they're not if

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.200
you're watching TV or something and in a

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.519
lot of ways you're your target and and

00:49:02.519 --> 00:49:06.250
or you're the commodity so you have to

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:07.960
think of it in that way that you are

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.839
super valuable as a commodity but you're

00:49:10.839 --> 00:49:13.630
also a target because people

00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:16.210
I mean I've fallen for phishing attacks

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.849
before - just like everybody else and I

00:49:18.849 --> 00:49:22.269
study those things so so everybody falls

00:49:22.269 --> 00:49:25.000
for it and and not everybody's perfect

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.579
all the time but but everybody is being

00:49:27.579 --> 00:49:30.640
targeted all the time and not in Adana

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.490
you're going to die away but the word

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.950
target is it's probably the wrong word

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:40.210
to use but but everybody needs to think

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.339
of it in that way you know from identity

00:49:42.339 --> 00:49:45.700
theft people are are being targeted all

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:48.309
the time for identity theft because it

00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:50.079
makes phishing attacks easier and it

00:49:50.079 --> 00:49:52.329
makes you know doing other things way

00:49:52.329 --> 00:49:54.670
easier and and you know the amount of

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:56.890
stuff that we put on our social media I

00:49:56.890 --> 00:50:00.940
mean it's super helpful for getting into

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.920
other accounts that you might have or

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.740
for learning more about a person to be

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.809
able to influence them more you know if

00:50:07.809 --> 00:50:10.630
you are looking to turn a person or you

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:14.230
a person you had access to the Facebook

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:17.230
account or something a person that had

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:19.809
access to something that you needed to

00:50:19.809 --> 00:50:23.680
satisfy whatever your goal was I mean

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.960
you just look at that and people talk

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.799
about their their family family life

00:50:29.799 --> 00:50:32.319
problems in their you know you know

00:50:32.319 --> 00:50:34.210
relationship problems and their money

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:36.640
problems or they'll have pictures of and

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.619
this is my dream someday and it's a

00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:40.779
picture of a car or boat or something

00:50:40.779 --> 00:50:43.420
dude if you're the adversary

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:46.119
I am definitely and that's a person that

00:50:46.119 --> 00:50:49.180
has access to the thing that I want I'm

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:52.359
calling that guy up and saying it's not

00:50:52.359 --> 00:50:54.670
not as direct as I'm doing it but I

00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:57.579
would definitely say hey dude I could

00:50:57.579 --> 00:50:59.289
put that boat in your driveway and give

00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:01.150
you like another 20 grand

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:04.180
if you do this for me yeah and there are

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:07.539
over over history I mean the last 50

00:51:07.539 --> 00:51:09.880
years or so that has happened so many

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.339
times it's terrifying

00:51:12.339 --> 00:51:14.559
well how about who was a guy who got

00:51:14.559 --> 00:51:16.480
busted I think it's a Harvard researcher

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.430
for like getting paid by China to do

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:19.990
research than he that he got kind of

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:21.910
like yeah wrapped up and stuff and that

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:23.650
kind of just all went away really like

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:27.549
no talk about anymore yeah yeah if

00:51:27.549 --> 00:51:29.770
you're if if somebody was interested and

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:32.049
they look up the book Tiger trap I don't

00:51:32.049 --> 00:51:33.579
remember the author offhand but I could

00:51:33.579 --> 00:51:36.579
look it up but basically yeah it goes

00:51:36.579 --> 00:51:39.480
over I think it was about 15 operation

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:44.680
since the 60s or 70s where that happens

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:47.740
where where China wants something and

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:51.220
you know they want access to our nuclear

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:53.650
information on nuclear weapons or

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:56.980
something and yeah so yeah you just

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.770
invite a scientist over and say hey yeah

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:01.630
you know we have this connection between

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:04.089
our universities in our research groups

00:52:04.089 --> 00:52:06.819
why don't you come over here we'll pay

00:52:06.819 --> 00:52:09.039
you to come to our country and speak to

00:52:09.039 --> 00:52:12.789
our University or our technology summit

00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:14.770
or something like that and put you up

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:18.010
and because because we don't think of

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:21.760
the or we as in people in in my opinion

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.279
in the United States we don't look at

00:52:24.279 --> 00:52:26.799
other countries or people in other

00:52:26.799 --> 00:52:32.440
countries as as I don't know competitors

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.859
I guess that might be the best word we

00:52:35.859 --> 00:52:38.230
just get freely tell them anything they

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:40.180
want and keep stuff away cuz we like

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:43.270
money and everybody likes to be you know

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:45.760
have parades and be treated like a

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.980
celebrity and stuff like that and if in

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:49.690
another country is going to offer that

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:51.849
to you you're gonna give stuff away

00:52:51.849 --> 00:52:54.130
that's basically what happened to that

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:57.099
Harvard guy and without knowing it where

00:52:57.099 --> 00:53:01.180
where yeah that's how it works is you

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.890
got to be more aware of that kind of

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:05.170
stuff because people are always looking

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:07.839
for stuff and it it could be a company

00:53:07.839 --> 00:53:10.420
it could be another country it could be

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:15.150
a political organization I mean yeah

00:53:15.609 --> 00:53:17.259
this is this is something cool to and I

00:53:17.259 --> 00:53:18.729
you know I kind of wanted to I know you

00:53:18.729 --> 00:53:19.959
sent me some stuff on this but it's like

00:53:19.959 --> 00:53:21.700
so you have this that you know have this

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.319
going on the Cova ever there's people

00:53:23.319 --> 00:53:25.140
like Hollis came from a lab in Wuhan

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.759
which again very plausible but it's like

00:53:27.759 --> 00:53:29.739
from what I from what I started reading

00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:31.089
it that you know the stuff you sent me

00:53:31.089 --> 00:53:33.299
was that like we kind of outsourced

00:53:33.299 --> 00:53:35.499
biological weapons research in a way

00:53:35.499 --> 00:53:37.029
that we kind of outsourced torture where

00:53:37.029 --> 00:53:38.410
it's like look we're not for this but

00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:39.609
like you know we'll just fund it on

00:53:39.609 --> 00:53:41.229
another in another country and you know

00:53:41.229 --> 00:53:43.239
reap all the back yeah yeah that was

00:53:43.239 --> 00:53:47.170
kind of going on yeah man right yeah and

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:52.569
and it was and and it this is where it

00:53:52.569 --> 00:53:54.880
where I could see where conspiracy

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.459
theories come from and things like that

00:53:57.459 --> 00:54:00.069
but that's why I prefer to just let the

00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:01.930
data speak for itself and people make

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:05.079
their own conclusions but but uh but

00:54:05.079 --> 00:54:07.719
basically yeah so that one article that

00:54:07.719 --> 00:54:10.509
I sent you if you look through so if you

00:54:10.509 --> 00:54:13.569
say that let's say that article itself

00:54:13.569 --> 00:54:14.709
was propaganda

00:54:14.709 --> 00:54:17.229
somehow if you looked at the linked

00:54:17.229 --> 00:54:19.989
articles then those take you to to

00:54:19.989 --> 00:54:22.359
report straight from the CDC or from the

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:24.969
Inspector General or you know these

00:54:24.969 --> 00:54:28.900
actual credible things and and those are

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:33.489
describing that story so it's yeah there

00:54:33.489 --> 00:54:35.440
must be some truth to it and there is

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.390
actual evidence in there in these

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:39.999
reports that yeah apparently we're

00:54:39.999 --> 00:54:44.349
really bad or we were really bad about

00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:47.499
handling things like coronaviruses I

00:54:47.499 --> 00:54:50.349
never knew it before before all of this

00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:51.940
stuff that's happening now I hadn't

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:54.459
really paid attention to like chemical

00:54:54.459 --> 00:54:57.099
biological stuff but I knew that it was

00:54:57.099 --> 00:54:58.359
a big thing

00:54:58.359 --> 00:55:00.309
more so than nuclear weapons in my

00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:04.569
opinion but uh and more likely but when

00:55:04.569 --> 00:55:06.249
you look at that stuff yeah apparently

00:55:06.249 --> 00:55:08.440
we're really bad at handling that stuff

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:12.699
and no in that CDC report there's

00:55:12.699 --> 00:55:15.670
incidences of just leaving smallpox

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:19.449
around alive smallpox or accidentally

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:22.180
sending anthrax as other countries or

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.910
other groups and stuff like that so we

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:27.720
we suck at least as much

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.390
as China does if it was leaked from a

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:33.119
China but I don't know about you but I

00:55:33.119 --> 00:55:34.770
don't remember hearing about this and I

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:37.829
don't remember people being super upset

00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:41.040
to the extent that we are for China of

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.380
her Cove in nineteen months and then

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.369
when you look through some of those

00:55:44.369 --> 00:55:47.790
papers yeah that there's anthony chachi

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:50.970
just group paid like thirty-seven point

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:52.470
two million dollars or was it three

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:53.760
point seven million dollars I can't

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.970
remember three point seven well yeah we

00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:59.369
were so bad at it that during the Obama

00:55:59.369 --> 00:56:02.040
administration when we were banned from

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:06.180
doing that type of work and yeah so we

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:09.540
were on China they're they're into just

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:10.950
like the rest of the world they're into

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:13.099
researching coronaviruses and

00:56:13.099 --> 00:56:15.450
potentially weaponizing them and and

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:18.480
also looking at them for weaponizing

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.069
home but at the same time to define like

00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:25.230
like vaccines forum because this stuff

00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:27.450
does happen so yeah it's certainly

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:30.869
possible not that it was made but

00:56:30.869 --> 00:56:32.700
because the intelligence community

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.579
already disputed that but but that yeah

00:56:35.579 --> 00:56:38.339
people research this stuff and sometimes

00:56:38.339 --> 00:56:40.290
it gets out and there's tons of evidence

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:43.740
that both we suck at it and apparently

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:47.520
China sucks at it too so so everybody

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.520
getting on the bandwagon just to bash

00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:53.880
China then it hurts the people that live

00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.800
here that you know that Chinese people

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.440
that live here that belief in the United

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.660
States and like living here and even our

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:03.390
citizens here they we get these really

00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:06.450
bad views on on your China's and now

00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:08.099
we're bashing all the people that live

00:57:08.099 --> 00:57:11.010
here that have nothing to do with that

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:13.560
stuff and they like this country those

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.930
more yeah look at both sides of the

00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:18.089
story and get both sides of the story if

00:57:18.089 --> 00:57:20.310
you hear that one side is bad well then

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:24.000
then just for your own sake look it up

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000
and see if if we do the same thing is

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.430
this a normal thing that happens and and

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:32.220
more often than not it really is I mean

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.470
this stuff happens it's just we only

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:38.360
hear about it being bad if it wasn't us

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.850
ya know in my opinion well it's funny

00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:42.110
too because then it's like you know so

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:43.100
you have this thing that happens say

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:45.740
just you know just say you know

00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:47.620
actuality it was you know kicking around

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.730
got broken out of a lap something

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:51.230
happened it just say maybe it was an

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:52.340
accident maybe it wasn't but maybe it

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:54.560
was it was an accident happens and then

00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:55.940
all that information gets filtered

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.010
through you know people who dominate the

00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:59.780
narrative where typically are beholden

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.180
to one of the two two-party systems then

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:04.010
you know lab spills from China

00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:06.050
Republican parties licking his chops and

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:07.460
may hell yeah dude we can start getting

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:09.620
people hate in China you can we can

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.450
capitalize off of this and you have you

00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:13.250
know the Democrats being like oh people

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:14.750
are hating Chinese people oh we can

00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:16.070
capitalize off this too and then we're

00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:16.820
gonna pump that we're gonna

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:18.350
sensationalize that as well yeah

00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:19.910
everything gets like into this megaphone

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:22.400
to spit back out and kind of like you

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.500
know weird distorted ways when reality

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.910
it's like yeah maybe somebody just

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:28.340
[ __ ] up which is very lately that

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.870
somebody just [ __ ] up as a hands

00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:32.090
everyday I [ __ ] up almost all my jobs

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:35.510
almost every day yeah dude I [ __ ] up

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:39.530
all the time but I also don't work at

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:42.800
like a level 4 biohazard type place but

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:44.960
yes there are people and they make

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:47.330
mistakes sometimes they got enough fight

00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:50.630
with their wife or her husband or

00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:52.280
something like that and then they're

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.960
rattled and the next day they're not

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.040
thinking straight and they make a

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.890
mistake totally happen and and sometimes

00:58:57.890 --> 00:59:00.350
the process is in place that prevent

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:02.720
that stuff sometimes people don't follow

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:07.790
up and and it happens so so did yeah but

00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:10.310
that kind of stuff definitely gets used

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:11.780
in the narrative and it's really

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:13.610
eye-opening in some ways when you start

00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:15.890
looking at the news outside of the

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:17.630
United States so not just the West

00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:20.620
perspective of news but you look at how

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:24.290
how other countries and you have to look

00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:26.300
at them collectively because everybody's

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:29.630
news is is played with in some way in my

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:32.540
opinion but when you look at it then it

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.640
gives you it gives me anyways like

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.710
things that I want to look up to

00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:39.680
validate actual stories in the United

00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:41.750
States if we're back in China about

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:44.600
something well if you look at Chinese

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.480
news or news around that you know Asian

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:49.370
countries are Southeast Asian countries

00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:52.250
what are they saying in

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:54.619
in there news and then the things that

00:59:54.619 --> 00:59:56.060
they were talking about on their site

00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.440
well then I'm gonna go and research

00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.619
those things and then try to find the

01:00:00.619 --> 01:00:02.660
truth of those things from their

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:05.510
perspective and which kind more often

01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:08.720
than not is yeah we both make these

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:12.320
mistakes just our news is dominated by a

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.990
Western view plane whereas their news

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:18.710
isn't necessarily and and the China in

01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:20.840
general with this Hong Kong stuff

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.740
there's a real big like problem problem

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.780
I have with the current narratives and

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.640
stuff because problems will never get

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.330
solved

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:33.470
with so it seems like in this purely my

01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:35.960
opinion but but it seems like most

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.720
discussions that are happening now in in

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.540
politics and and just discussions

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.760
foreign policy in general everything

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.340
starts like everybody who's brained and

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.710
arguments start from like World War two

01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:51.740
forward but the period of time that

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.349
existed before that especially as it

01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:58.690
relates to China between 1830 and 1950 I

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:02.119
mean the become the countries that are

01:01:02.119 --> 01:01:04.730
part of the g7 those countries

01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:08.150
completely in my opinion [ __ ]

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:11.510
China over and and Britain I mean and

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:13.820
anybody can read it it's historical

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.700
record first in Second Opium Wars and

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.109
the first and second Chinese Japanese

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:23.900
Wars you read those things and British

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.080
basic the British and a lot of is that

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.690
British were like major drug dealers and

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:33.800
they flooded China with opium and and

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.290
pretty much screwed up most of the

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:39.619
country but the they also like enslaved

01:01:39.619 --> 01:01:42.820
in torture and it's made them assimilate

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:45.280
most of the Chinese people which

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.190
eventually brought down the I think it's

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:51.619
pronounced Qing Empire or the last

01:01:51.619 --> 01:01:56.230
dynasty damn and that that set up the

01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:59.990
kind of the mixing bowl of you now have

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:03.109
the Chinese military and you have this

01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:05.270
communist party here now there's no

01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:06.140
longer

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.450
this dynasty its Emperor that's

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:11.480
controlling China and the Communist

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.730
Party was more powerful and kicked the

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.950
military out sent the military than to

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:20.240
that Kuomintang to Taiwan and now

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.800
communist party owns China well well

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.770
honestly and if anybody if anybody reads

01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:29.300
that stuff and comes at a different

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.860
conclusion I'd love to talk to you

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:34.070
because I'm I'm curious but you could

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:36.860
say that the countries of the g7 are

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:39.590
responsible for China being a communist

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:42.080
country now I mean just based on those

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.790
Wars and what we did

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:47.570
I mean Portuguese yes he took Macau and

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:50.090
they took Hong Kong Hong Kong they never

01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:51.800
should have been at one country two

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.710
systems' Hong Kong was stolen by the

01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:57.170
British and then all those people that

01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:59.750
lived there were forced were forced to

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:03.650
assimilate to become British basically

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:07.460
yes and you know all of the people all

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:10.400
the people that live through that are

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.100
gone because you know that was 1830s and

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:16.430
1950s and nobody remembers that so now

01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:19.130
it's people that only know British

01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:20.960
occupation and so of course they're

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.480
going to be way against the mainland but

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.460
that was it never should have been

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.790
stolen in the first place

01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:30.740
all Chinese and then China was like what

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.930
hunter personally what the [ __ ] you guys

01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:34.790
come on man they want to be coming it's

01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:40.730
leave them alone that's exactly how you

01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:42.610
a night when I have these discussions

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:46.010
you know because is for to eliminate

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:48.950
bias so I was like it seems like our

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.220
narrative is now about ten years ago I

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.080
was the same way where I was like yeah

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.510
[ __ ] those guys but then but then when

01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:58.940
you start doing you're kind of trying to

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:01.510
eliminate bias and things like that well

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:03.860
you know I do lots of threat emulation

01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:06.650
so when you start trying to figure out

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:09.320
the way the way the culture or history

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.290
is for your adversary if you think about

01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:14.270
things or try to figure out the way it

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:16.820
is that they think about whatever it is

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.670
and if your arguments stand up then

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:22.430
chances are that are valid arguments but

01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:25.520
if they don't then then they're biased

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.650
arguments in my opinion and so when I

01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:29.420
started looking at it you know I learned

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:31.309
about this period of time because you

01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:35.599
always hear about she and and a lot of

01:04:35.599 --> 01:04:37.640
people in China talked about that

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.780
century of humiliation that is this 1830

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.380
to 1950 timeframe and it that the first

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.540
thing kids in their schools learn is

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:50.359
about the opium wars not because they

01:04:50.359 --> 01:04:54.140
were huge Wars but because it was it was

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.960
very impactful to their culture and

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.299
that's what they're the game they're

01:04:59.299 --> 01:05:01.880
playing right now is they won't they do

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.130
not want that to ever happen again so

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:06.049
they're doing everything to prevent that

01:05:06.049 --> 01:05:08.329
from happening but nobody is having that

01:05:08.329 --> 01:05:11.390
conversation nobody is none of it you

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:14.059
know as the United States and the UK

01:05:14.059 --> 01:05:16.819
nobody is saying do we're really sorry

01:05:16.819 --> 01:05:20.030
that we completely [ __ ] you guys for a

01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:23.420
hundred hundred years and then we made a

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.750
big deal about giving you your parentage

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:29.480
sovereign territory back but then told

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.690
you that you have to to leave it the way

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:35.450
it is for another 50 years because we

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:38.059
make tons of money there I mean and

01:05:38.059 --> 01:05:41.119
that's basically what happened in 97 so

01:05:41.119 --> 01:05:43.359
the way that I present this argument and

01:05:43.359 --> 01:05:47.750
my circles on because most of the people

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:50.720
I work with and and I was one of them to

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.089
and until I learned about this period

01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:55.549
started looking into this century of

01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:57.890
humiliation period um

01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:59.869
you start looking at that period of

01:05:59.869 --> 01:06:01.970
history and everything they're doing

01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:04.880
makes complete sense and if I was then I

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.400
would do the exact same thing like I

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.640
would be [ __ ] you guys you completely

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.460
screwed it's over and and the choral

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:16.010
kind of the connection to the United

01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:18.710
States to make it more real would be

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:21.710
imagine China came over here while the

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:24.290
United States was still young and and

01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:29.780
vulnerable he came over and just flooded

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:30.589
the country

01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:31.960
with what

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.730
opium and and got the entire country

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:39.400
just hooked on drugs and then we they

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.430
forced the entire United States to only

01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:44.260
trade with them and you had they do

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.660
everything they said and not only did

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.760
you do that but you took over and

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:52.359
occupied all of California you just took

01:06:52.359 --> 01:06:55.960
it and everybody had to deal and the

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.190
United States just had to deal with

01:06:57.190 --> 01:07:00.250
China taking California and all the

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.650
people that lived in California then had

01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:04.930
to completely assimilate to Chinese

01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:07.630
culture you had to learn there like you

01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:09.190
could only speak their language you had

01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:12.670
to learn their customs and then and then

01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:16.180
they held it for a hundred years or so

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.950
and then they just decided one day to

01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:24.700
because you know politics is what it is

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:27.339
and and you know the type was kind of

01:07:27.339 --> 01:07:29.950
turning where hey it's really bad that

01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:31.390
you did it so maybe you should give it

01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:33.970
back kind of stuff so that at some point

01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:37.660
kind of then goes hey we're going to be

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.400
super nice people and we're going to

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.830
give you back what we stole a hundred

01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:44.380
years ago but you have to keep it the

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:47.140
way it is for another 50 years because

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:49.030
we make too much [ __ ] money off of

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:51.310
this place and we want to continue to do

01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:54.550
that so then then that's the situation

01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:57.849
is basically happen and so the people

01:07:57.849 --> 01:07:59.710
that are there they definitely should be

01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:02.500
upset in Hong Kong it they should be

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.670
upset but they're in my opinion there

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:09.490
their anger and and stuff like that is

01:08:09.490 --> 01:08:12.250
misdirected you shouldn't necessarily be

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:15.190
focused at in China I mean maybe it

01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:16.839
should I don't live there I'm not I'm

01:08:16.839 --> 01:08:18.580
not a Hong Kong or I don't really know

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:21.100
what it's like to be them so maybe that

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.230
isn't fair for me to say but they should

01:08:23.230 --> 01:08:25.150
really be upset with the countries of

01:08:25.150 --> 01:08:28.210
the rest of the g7 who created that

01:08:28.210 --> 01:08:31.540
scenario that they're in now we're kinda

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.430
is trying to reclaim what it lost during

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:35.739
that century of humiliation the things

01:08:35.739 --> 01:08:38.739
that were stolen from them and literally

01:08:38.739 --> 01:08:41.350
stolen from them and and that's all

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:44.440
they're doing if we were if if that

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.770
happened to us we would

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:47.930
definitely want to reclaim California

01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:50.560
and nobody would stop us from doing it

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.420
so when you you play like these

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:57.440
alternate you know defending the B

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.290
alternate side as an argument some of

01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:02.210
this stuff is like yeah I totally get

01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:04.400
why they would do that then I totally

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.750
get why they're doing the things they

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:07.910
are doing now totally get why they would

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.980
you know all of those islands that

01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.380
people complain about I totally get why

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.319
they would block that stuff back because

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:16.339
you know they built the Great Wall of

01:09:16.339 --> 01:09:18.109
China to protect themselves because

01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:21.109
there were no water-based threats back

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:24.020
then and there were only the Mongols on

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.850
horseback that were [ __ ] them up so

01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:28.310
they built the Great Wall of China but

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:30.529
but then they'd hadn't considered that

01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:34.120
from the sea would be the neck red and

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.770
so they weren't protected from the sea

01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:39.230
and that's what happened so if you look

01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:41.810
at it from from their perspective of

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:44.089
never wanting that to happen again it

01:09:44.089 --> 01:09:46.700
makes sense why the reclaim and islands

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.770
that were theirs for thousands of years

01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:54.380
before 1830 to 1950 China owned all of

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.960
that that was China's territory for

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.330
thousands of years there's a longest

01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:02.390
running continuously excuse me

01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:04.790
continuous running civilization in

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:08.360
history so for thousands of years that

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.170
was their stuff and then you know the

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:14.480
West shows up and just decided that they

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.200
wanted and took it and you know the

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.030
Chinese weren't in a position to be able

01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:22.970
to defend themselves and that's the

01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:25.430
actual historical truth and that's not

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:27.470
that's not me being a sympathizer

01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:29.420
because I still say [ __ ] those guys

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:31.730
because I live here and I like the ways

01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:34.850
here but what's important you can buy

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:36.350
that try that's the thing you got to be

01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:37.450
able to put you know at least have some

01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:39.530
comprehensive understanding that's yeah

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:40.700
I think a lot of people are struggling

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:41.960
with right now and that's where I think

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:45.710
the news yeah hounded by you know how

01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:47.300
easily accessible everybody is

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.340
compounded by like the Holy Bible ISM

01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:50.480
and all this stuff and then and the

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.850
incentive the social media incentive

01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:54.740
based on just like you know group

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.270
thinking hitting out some group think

01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:58.310
you know take out into the informational

01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:59.210
you know

01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:01.130
whatever in like the Twittersphere and

01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:02.720
then you get all this you know yeah your

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.400
biological validation where your

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.780
dopamine floods and you're like yeah

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.000
yeah everyone likes it yeah yeah and

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.950
then likes in here I yeah it would be

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:12.170
like oh [ __ ] that [ __ ] China actually

01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:14.750
it's like no that seems legitimate you

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:15.980
know it seems legitimate and like you

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.390
said you can know all that and still go

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:18.950
and [ __ ] them anyway because I live here

01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:21.260
and but you know that's what happened

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.970
and that's what I think obviously yeah

01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:27.620
perspective so if you're looking at like

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:30.200
that view there's a really great speaker

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:35.530
that works as a naval war academy or war

01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:42.650
so a real a real expert although that

01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:45.080
guy is super entertaining and has great

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:50.180
hair well well this is how does the how

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.790
does you know how do like how does

01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:55.310
America then try to even like get along

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:56.990
when they still talk about like getting

01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:59.300
along with China like yeah how do you

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.070
get along with the country that you know

01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:03.320
you in again you can even sit with a

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.090
historical dial you can set it back and

01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:06.440
maybe China did something to your I

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.790
don't I don't know I don't think they

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:10.490
really did they do it yep they did yeah

01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:13.640
okay so yeah what so as China no no I

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.950
meant that aggressed against your has

01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:17.330
ever been like aggressive against Europe

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:22.730
uh it sort of as espionage like this

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:25.460
stuff that's going on now I haven't seen

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:26.960
it but that doesn't mean it doesn't

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.480
exist but I definitely looked for it

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.600
because from understanding from an

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.250
understanding my adversary

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.680
and how they might come after me I

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:38.900
haven't seen any evidence of that

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:42.110
outside of espionage you know feeling a

01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:45.080
corporate secrets because it's easier to

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.970
steal other people's stuff and spend the

01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:49.340
time to figure it out yourself basically

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:51.860
yeah that's one of the nine principles

01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:55.480
of their Chinese military warfare is is

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:57.710
stealing your opponent's ideas in

01:12:57.710 --> 01:13:00.800
technology for strategic purposes that's

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:01.970
for you know how do they get along how

01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:03.080
they supposed to like how you supposed

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.430
to even like make sense of that in a

01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:06.920
modern geopolitical like you know

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.590
context of being like all right like our

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:12.110
bad but you know chill the [ __ ] out and

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:13.160
stop yeah

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.260
so how do they even like have some hopes

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.820
of doing that so in my opinion it

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:22.730
basically at this guy Andrew Eric's and

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:24.500
it talked about if you look at

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:28.220
competitive coexistence yes and Andrew

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:31.130
Erickson that guy pretty much laid laid

01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:33.770
it out and he eats the guy or one of the

01:13:33.770 --> 01:13:37.700
guys that talks to Congress and so but

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:40.520
we're not doing that because for

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:41.840
whatever forever

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.670
maybe it's the current administration I

01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:46.580
don't know but what he lays out is is

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.530
what in my opinion what we should be

01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:52.130
doing where we have to so China is

01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:56.360
viewpoint is that is get getting back

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.340
and making sure that hundred years of

01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:02.030
humiliation never happens again so that

01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:05.570
is their entire culture and their entire

01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:08.300
Chinese dream and and all of the stuff

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:12.230
everything is based on that so so duh

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:14.540
any commerce see in my opinion any

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:18.320
conversations that we have or any plant

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.930
or anything we have to start with that

01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:23.360
as the beginning point because that's

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.020
where they are

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:26.360
whether we like it or not that's where

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.430
they are and this we don't take that

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.330
into account

01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:31.490
then nothing we do actually matters

01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:34.850
because in reality we need them a lot

01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:36.950
more than they need us at this point

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:41.330
mmm so so I mean if if we really wanted

01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:43.310
to play this hard-nosed game like we are

01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:45.980
now we should have done it in like the

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:46.820
mid 80s

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:49.670
we should have if we really wanted them

01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:52.010
to become democratic you know we wanted

01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:54.050
to support like we say we want to

01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:55.940
support Hong Kong we would have done

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:59.450
something at after during the Tim

01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:01.940
Tiananmen Square incident I mean that

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:04.610
was the time that to turn that and we

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:08.300
did it because hey we make a [ __ ] ton of

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.640
money over there and that's just my

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.120
opinion

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:14.560
but but we didn't do anything and and

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.610
Tiananmen Square it's [ __ ] horrible

01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:20.090
if you ever read it I mean God and and

01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:22.550
nobody did anything other than lip

01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:26.810
service and Hyperion but uh but that was

01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:28.520
the time to do something but we've

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.490
missed all of those opportunities and so

01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:34.670
much stuff is left here because it's too

01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:38.420
expensive leaves you here and I could go

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:39.980
on about that just from my previous

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.510
career because I've seen it firsthand

01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:45.710
that that uh yeah I mean the time to be

01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:48.890
hard-nosed about it it's gone now we we

01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:51.650
are peers I mean the head of Pacific

01:15:51.650 --> 01:15:56.900
Command has said wow if we went to war

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.880
and this isn't me speaking this is the

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.980
head of Pacific Command the guy that

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:04.910
knows that he said if we went to war

01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:08.900
with China just from its you know from a

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:13.520
Navy standpoint we would lose so you

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.690
need to stop in my opinion we have to

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:20.330
stop just you know pretending like we're

01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:22.370
the biggest dog on the block where we

01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:24.860
are in some things but but not with them

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:28.030
anymore we have to treat them more as

01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:30.800
the thing that exists that we have to

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.750
deal with now and that's kind of what

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:35.900
that competitive coexistence framework

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:39.920
is and I think that's the way to go you

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:42.590
have to start that arguments there and I

01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:45.230
kind of bully um with trade because they

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:48.230
know that they hold all the cards really

01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:49.670
like there's so much thing of like

01:16:49.670 --> 01:16:51.590
really isolate and form all of our own

01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:52.760
you know we're gonna start our own

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.380
factories and isolate against them

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:56.270
that's kind of like a pipe dream in your

01:16:56.270 --> 01:17:00.560
opinion I mean uh that stuff could

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:04.460
happen and I hope I hope we really do my

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:06.410
hope for this country is that we really

01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:09.680
do take that stuff seriously and people

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.840
in this country really start to actually

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:15.770
care about the benefits and the freedom

01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:18.110
we have here and we start competing

01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:21.470
again in all of these things but when

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.450
you read that regardless of what gets

01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:25.670
said in our news and I think India some

01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:27.410
of them but there are all these trade

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:30.020
associations where are all the companies

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.110
that are in Hong Kong right now from the

01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:35.120
United States like two hundred and fifty

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.010
of them and they're your thirty your big

01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:38.570
ones like your caterpillar is your

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:39.940
animal thawne's

01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:44.350
Microsoft and Apple all of those if you

01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:47.469
look at the this trade association did a

01:17:47.469 --> 01:17:49.960
survey of all of these companies based

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.739
on the topics that keep coming up in our

01:17:53.739 --> 01:17:56.140
news do you plan to come back to the

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:59.199
United States it was like 10% of them

01:17:59.199 --> 01:18:02.890
said maybe and then like 70% of them

01:18:02.890 --> 01:18:05.410
said no we're staying in China and then

01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:08.230
like another percentage of them said we

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:10.660
may leave China but we're not going back

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.030
to the United States and they look at

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:14.739
the amount of money they they say they

01:18:14.739 --> 01:18:16.480
make they make in like a hundred and

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.910
fifty percent profit every year for the

01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:21.280
last 20 years why would you leave if

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.680
you're a company to come back to United

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.530
States because in my previous career

01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:28.510
when I used to design and build things

01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:31.239
to move that stuff has been gone long

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:34.330
enough that the knowledge of making that

01:18:34.330 --> 01:18:37.090
stuff here has either been purchased and

01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:42.250
moved to China or or or it's just gone

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.110
all those people have retired and died

01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:47.050
by now so the knowledge of that stuff

01:18:47.050 --> 01:18:49.719
would take time to get back and then

01:18:49.719 --> 01:18:52.180
building up those factories you know

01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:55.090
modernizing them and getting all of the

01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:57.640
stuff that it takes to make stuff here

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.910
again it would all take time and tons of

01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:03.670
money and the people in this country

01:19:03.670 --> 01:19:06.489
would have to start going to college and

01:19:06.489 --> 01:19:09.370
getting into those STEM fields I hear

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:11.560
about all the time we have to you know

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.989
when we go to school we have to not

01:19:13.989 --> 01:19:16.570
learn about I mean philosophy and and

01:19:16.570 --> 01:19:18.340
that kind of stuff is super important

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:22.330
but we can't all be YouTube stars yeah

01:19:22.330 --> 01:19:25.060
in order to compete in the world we have

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.340
to we have to have people that are

01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.110
actually going to college and learning

01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:32.320
the stuff that makes that makes a

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:35.050
country that makes society or that make

01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:37.989
factories work and and things like that

01:19:37.989 --> 01:19:40.150
and we don't really have that anymore

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:43.630
and it went away a long time ago and and

01:19:43.630 --> 01:19:46.390
so did all of the companies that make

01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:49.360
those things like so one of the things

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.159
that I pay attention to a lot

01:19:52.159 --> 01:19:55.460
I do risk assessments for the nation's

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:58.960
power system for attacks from

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.510
adversaries and one of the things one of

01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:05.630
the really scary things to me is that a

01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:07.730
lot of the things that make our power

01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:11.179
system work also are required which are

01:20:11.179 --> 01:20:15.349
rare earth elements um those those make

01:20:15.349 --> 01:20:17.059
our computers work our phones work

01:20:17.059 --> 01:20:19.699
radars and targeting systems and

01:20:19.699 --> 01:20:22.250
satellites and most of the things on the

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:25.219
power system all rely on a supply of

01:20:25.219 --> 01:20:28.550
rare earth elements well over the last

01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:33.590
20 years China just being China I mean

01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:36.409
this is how capitalism works they came

01:20:36.409 --> 01:20:39.409
here identified those two companies that

01:20:39.409 --> 01:20:41.929
they wanted or the mind that they wanted

01:20:41.929 --> 01:20:45.770
and just bought so they bought these

01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:48.949
companies and then shut him down and

01:20:48.949 --> 01:20:52.400
then moved them away and all of the

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.380
patents and all of the stuff that goes

01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:57.139
with that they see a live in this

01:20:57.139 --> 01:21:00.739
country like is enough this yeah yeah

01:21:00.739 --> 01:21:05.020
when when I don't know I can't say it's

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:09.650
exactly everything but but when we say

01:21:09.650 --> 01:21:11.900
when we as in the United States when we

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.409
say that China is stolen all our

01:21:14.409 --> 01:21:17.900
intellectual property that same survey

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:20.150
of those that traded those trade

01:21:20.150 --> 01:21:22.309
associations they asked that question

01:21:22.309 --> 01:21:24.880
and it could be maybe those companies

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.290
didn't want to say what they really

01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:28.429
thought because they were afraid of

01:21:28.429 --> 01:21:31.730
losing business in China but all of them

01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:34.250
said that that was like the bottom of

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:37.909
the list of concerns for them was losing

01:21:37.909 --> 01:21:40.730
intellectual property their primary

01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:44.150
concern was that we would think shake

01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:46.550
things up over here to make it difficult

01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:48.980
to impossible for them to do business in

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:53.270
China and those are facts on it and and

01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:56.960
and so there was a USGS report for the

01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:02.090
national security implications of stuff

01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:05.140
that we need here to protect

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:09.760
our country militarily and and so that

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.110
was 2010 and there were reports before

01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:16.360
that and and everybody knows about it

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.010
you read some of the transcripts from

01:22:18.010 --> 01:22:20.080
you know the Federal Trade Commission

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.260
and a bunch of these other you know

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.340
organizations and crap like that in

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:26.140
government where these discussions

01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:30.100
happen and companies are freely giving

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:32.640
all of this stuff away because China has

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:35.410
three and a half or I forget how much it

01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:38.260
is maybe it's only two times it's like

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:40.210
two or three times the size of the

01:22:40.210 --> 01:22:43.060
population of the United States so

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:45.130
that's it and and all of those people

01:22:45.130 --> 01:22:49.660
are middle-class or upper-class and they

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:52.570
all have for the most part they have

01:22:52.570 --> 01:22:55.150
money and savings so if you were a

01:22:55.150 --> 01:22:56.920
company and you want to do business are

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.270
you going to do it here or are you going

01:22:58.270 --> 01:23:02.590
to do it there wait you know make tons

01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:04.300
of money I don't have to go there as

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:05.950
I've heard before like all like a lot of

01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:07.240
them are like super poor and you know

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.810
almost like a no no no honest I mean

01:23:10.810 --> 01:23:14.350
obviously I'm not I'm not there and so

01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:18.010
on the ground on the ground I don't know

01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:21.280
but from from all of the reports and

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.950
just the historical stuff that I can get

01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:27.910
access to out nope and it's no they're

01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:30.910
actually known for bringing I believe it

01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:32.980
was that was one of their things in

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:35.650
order to keep people believing in the

01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:37.750
communist system you had to get people

01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:40.210
out poverty because if people don't have

01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:41.920
money don't have jobs and don't have

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.410
things to eat then there's more likely

01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:46.660
to have a revolution or something yeah

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.280
so in order to stay empowering you got

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:52.180
to defeat poverty and so I think it

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.630
started with Deng Xiaoping and has

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:58.270
continued since but but basically they

01:23:58.270 --> 01:24:02.080
brought like 300 and I'd have to look it

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.000
up to get the exact number by I believe

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.610
it was around 300 million people out of

01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:10.860
poverty so they're literally from

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:15.730
historical records there literally isn't

01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:17.550
supposed to be

01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:21.449
any poverty in China everybody has a job

01:24:21.449 --> 01:24:24.449
they they basically have that limited or

01:24:24.449 --> 01:24:28.440
that standard income bottom income or

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:33.179
whatever it is yeah so so yeah so if you

01:24:33.179 --> 01:24:36.690
believe all of the room the historical

01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:38.670
will report on that kind of stuff then

01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:42.090
know it supposedly there isn't but then

01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:44.190
again I'm not in China and sure so you

01:24:44.190 --> 01:24:46.110
have to believe what it gets written

01:24:46.110 --> 01:24:48.869
down and people that are supposed to

01:24:48.869 --> 01:24:50.400
have gone there and and looked at this

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.739
stuff a friend but yeah so there's not

01:24:52.739 --> 01:24:56.639
supposed to be so so and and when you

01:24:56.639 --> 01:24:58.650
look at like the UN and some of these

01:24:58.650 --> 01:25:02.280
other international agencies and

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:03.329
organizations

01:25:03.329 --> 01:25:06.480
I mean 95% of the people on the mainland

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.210
report being happy with the communist

01:25:09.210 --> 01:25:13.110
government so which is different than

01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:16.710
what I hear about here and in our news

01:25:16.710 --> 01:25:19.500
yeah exactly we hear about the 1 million

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:23.309
people in Hong Kong are upset but that's

01:25:23.309 --> 01:25:26.460
less than a percent of the entire

01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:31.770
population of China it's that's pretty

01:25:31.770 --> 01:25:33.750
nuts man well in terms of UGS I'm

01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:35.639
allergic poke it's been we've had you

01:25:35.639 --> 01:25:36.840
for a while I don't want to do this

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.520
again cuz I get to listen to you talk

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.460
all day in terms of the oh sorry yeah no

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:42.809
no I'm saying I'm serious like I really

01:25:42.809 --> 01:25:44.429
could because you know I've been like

01:25:44.429 --> 01:25:46.770
dying to try to figure out you know and

01:25:46.770 --> 01:25:48.179
again this is just one issue there's

01:25:48.179 --> 01:25:49.380
like this there's a gazillion different

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:51.000
issues there's the only different ways

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.760
Expedia in terms of helping people like

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.800
starts sort separating a wheat from the

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.179
chaff like if you take like the average

01:25:57.179 --> 01:25:59.760
dude who is either you know say take a

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.860
dude who's reading like Mother Jones and

01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:02.969
all that stuff or just someone who's

01:26:02.969 --> 01:26:04.290
even on the polar side of that who's

01:26:04.290 --> 01:26:05.699
just like you know lapping up stuff on

01:26:05.699 --> 01:26:08.460
4chan where would you push them towards

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.949
like getting like to try to like start

01:26:10.949 --> 01:26:12.599
because the thing like it feels real out

01:26:12.599 --> 01:26:13.980
of conspiracy theory you get a lot of uh

01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:16.619
you know I kind of support that way of

01:26:16.619 --> 01:26:17.909
thinking like looking into things but

01:26:17.909 --> 01:26:19.079
then it becomes like alright so you're

01:26:19.079 --> 01:26:20.340
like you're not believing kind of

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:22.920
percent not believing like a news thing

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.119
like okay good but then you'll just

01:26:24.119 --> 01:26:25.829
watch a YouTube and they will look I saw

01:26:25.829 --> 01:26:27.030
this thing and the guy was like oh we

01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:28.679
have official war done yeah showed you a

01:26:28.679 --> 01:26:30.329
piece of paper and it's like yeah what

01:26:30.329 --> 01:26:31.320
the [ __ ] is that

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.449
you know so it's like yeah how would you

01:26:33.449 --> 01:26:35.040
tell people to find like you know get

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:38.280
better better better at looking into

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:39.630
things themselves like how do you even

01:26:39.630 --> 01:26:45.869
do that so yeah kind of a tough one that

01:26:45.869 --> 01:26:47.429
has actually been something I've been

01:26:47.429 --> 01:26:51.210
trying to think about because yeah as

01:26:51.210 --> 01:26:53.040
part of this research project it's find

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.349
it did to share what I've learned with

01:26:55.349 --> 01:26:57.210
people but yeah it doesn't help anybody

01:26:57.210 --> 01:27:01.440
if they can't necessarily you know start

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.989
on their own and figure it out so the

01:27:03.989 --> 01:27:05.969
stuff that the things that I can tell

01:27:05.969 --> 01:27:08.849
you that the things that I do and have

01:27:08.849 --> 01:27:11.429
worked out really well for me over time

01:27:11.429 --> 01:27:12.989
as far as finding open source

01:27:12.989 --> 01:27:15.810
information and hopefully that's helpful

01:27:15.810 --> 01:27:18.869
and if anybody has ideas or better ways

01:27:18.869 --> 01:27:22.770
or questions I mean definitely shoot

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:26.880
them off too and that and and I can get

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.139
to work on them and come up with some

01:27:28.139 --> 01:27:31.500
answers but but basically I don't I

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:36.060
don't watch news I don't get my news off

01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:39.210
of or I don't watch youtube videos other

01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:41.010
than I like watching people fall down

01:27:41.010 --> 01:27:44.130
makes me laugh you know but I don't I

01:27:44.130 --> 01:27:46.679
don't look at it for for for other stuff

01:27:46.679 --> 01:27:48.630
other than that I don't go on that the

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:51.199
four cans and all that stuff because

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:55.139
because the people that in my opinion

01:27:55.139 --> 01:27:57.270
the people that that actually know the

01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:59.250
answers to these things aren't in any of

01:27:59.250 --> 01:28:02.159
those places in my opinion and now

01:28:02.159 --> 01:28:05.550
Twitter on the other hand I don't I

01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:08.670
don't use Twitter for for as a credible

01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:12.869
source but there are a lot of things you

01:28:12.869 --> 01:28:15.389
know if you pick in an author like the

01:28:15.389 --> 01:28:17.099
guy that wrote the disinformation book

01:28:17.099 --> 01:28:19.889
or for Kovan 19 you pick some of these

01:28:19.889 --> 01:28:23.130
these major characters and then look at

01:28:23.130 --> 01:28:25.800
the people that that are associated with

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.840
that person and just start looking at

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.880
some of the things that they're posting

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.889
and talking about and then take those

01:28:31.889 --> 01:28:34.380
things and then just go and research the

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.270
topics that are talking about hey this

01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:39.540
prick ssin said this thing and when I

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:40.860
look at stuff like that

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:43.230
if it if it kind of makes the hair on

01:28:43.230 --> 01:28:45.310
the back of my neck stand up like

01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:48.490
I get it I react to it in some way good

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:50.800
or bad and not something I want to look

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:53.920
into because it caused this reaction to

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.930
me so I'll go and look into that to see

01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:58.630
what the truth of that thing is and

01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:00.910
that's just Google going around and and

01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:04.330
looking at articles that come up some of

01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:06.640
the new sources that that that I get

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:08.500
every morning that I look at from an

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:11.380
open source standpoint way standpoint

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:15.550
are I go to the site called the cypher

01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:17.680
brief and I can send all this stuff -

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:20.740
yes sure yes but I go to I go to the

01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:22.390
cypher brief they have a free newsletter

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:25.770
and the cypher brief is is basically

01:29:25.770 --> 01:29:29.050
pretty much the head the retired heads

01:29:29.050 --> 01:29:31.500
of the military and intelligence

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.410
organisations and news organizations and

01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:37.090
colleges and it's all these people that

01:29:37.090 --> 01:29:39.910
that would actually be in a position to

01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:41.860
know the answers to a lot of these

01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:45.250
questions and and so you get this little

01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:47.290
newsletter it's a whole site where all

01:29:47.290 --> 01:29:50.830
of these people write write thoughts and

01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:52.870
answer questions and stuff like that and

01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:55.000
those are the people that would actually

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.970
know and their free newsletter has like

01:29:57.970 --> 01:30:01.390
an open-source amount of information and

01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:03.880
they link to all of the articles that

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.830
are in their thing so you can follow the

01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:08.410
links and and that's basically what I do

01:30:08.410 --> 01:30:11.380
is I find it they start with a credible

01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:13.900
source and then I just follow the links

01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:16.570
down and if those links go to another

01:30:16.570 --> 01:30:19.180
credible source or to a PDF document

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:20.830
like the ones I sent you

01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:23.200
then I'll download it and then read that

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:25.210
and then usually in there in the

01:30:25.210 --> 01:30:27.700
bibliography or in the references

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:30.280
section or something so be the names of

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.830
a bunch of books that that help the

01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:34.990
influence writing that paper and I might

01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:37.660
read some of those and so that's kind of

01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:40.920
how I start oh so you do more research

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:43.030
like so you're basically looking at

01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:44.020
sources because you know if you're

01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:45.760
looking at a news story that's not a

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.530
source right and that's kind of like

01:30:47.530 --> 01:30:49.090
you're just looking right no one's take

01:30:49.090 --> 01:30:51.130
on that's that's that's the sin of the

01:30:51.130 --> 01:30:52.360
news right now with me is that we have

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.670
so much information so much research and

01:30:54.670 --> 01:30:57.429
the news is just and it's like why

01:30:57.429 --> 01:30:59.230
why are we even it's like you can have

01:30:59.230 --> 01:31:01.540
some of that of course but it's like you

01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:03.550
know yeah we were drowning eddied looks

01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:04.780
like let's you know people should try to

01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:08.440
sift through that first yes yeah and and

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:10.960
and even and then the news isn't

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:14.980
necessarily bad I just think that people

01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:17.260
should validate the viewpoints and

01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:19.239
opinions that are on there and you could

01:31:19.239 --> 01:31:21.310
start with a topic you learned about on

01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:23.890
the news and start googling around and

01:31:23.890 --> 01:31:28.870
looking for for actual sources like 8

01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:31.449
the person that actually said this thing

01:31:31.449 --> 01:31:33.760
that they're having an opinion about on

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.590
the news I'm going to look up that

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:37.929
person and then see what they actually

01:31:37.929 --> 01:31:39.760
you know the types of things they

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:42.730
actually write and after a while you

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:45.130
kind of you can kind of tell what kind

01:31:45.130 --> 01:31:47.170
of [ __ ] when you when you see it or

01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:49.480
that there's more to the story than

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:51.730
what's being shown on the news and then

01:31:51.730 --> 01:31:54.370
it gets easier to go in and and track

01:31:54.370 --> 01:31:56.650
those things down but sounding up for

01:31:56.650 --> 01:31:59.770
the sites like that I get a daily

01:31:59.770 --> 01:32:01.989
newsletter thing from like defense one

01:32:01.989 --> 01:32:04.929
they had tons of topics linked articles

01:32:04.929 --> 01:32:07.989
and they're credible sources so and

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:10.600
that's pretty much all I do and then

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:13.110
I'll Google around sometimes for stuff

01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:16.929
that I that I think is interesting and I

01:32:16.929 --> 01:32:19.239
feel like I need to know more about or

01:32:19.239 --> 01:32:22.570
to play like that alternate perspective

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:25.810
on a specific thing I'm lucky in some

01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:29.380
ways that I have I have actual sources

01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:33.070
that I can look at and and so I can

01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:35.050
start there and then go hey I want to

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:36.940
look at you know I want to learn more

01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:39.040
about this and so then I can go outside

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.770
in and just start learning more stuff on

01:32:41.770 --> 01:32:43.500
my own that way but if you're starting

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.929
straight from outside that's what I

01:32:46.929 --> 01:32:50.949
would do is is don't just react or make

01:32:50.949 --> 01:32:54.010
an emotional reaction to something you

01:32:54.010 --> 01:32:57.190
see in here just take that thing and

01:32:57.190 --> 01:32:59.500
then try to figure out if that's the

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.210
real story or not or what's the

01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:03.550
alternative perspective of that story

01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:06.969
Josh you know that is people that's what

01:33:06.969 --> 01:33:08.739
we should be doing you know more

01:33:08.739 --> 01:33:11.379
critical thinking I get that red team

01:33:11.379 --> 01:33:15.010
at essentia that's basically what that

01:33:15.010 --> 01:33:19.329
everybody in the DoD learns when you go

01:33:19.329 --> 01:33:20.889
in because you have to make those

01:33:20.889 --> 01:33:23.019
decisions because you're in foreign

01:33:23.019 --> 01:33:26.349
countries where the disinformation in

01:33:26.349 --> 01:33:31.079
war is way more intense than it is here

01:33:31.079 --> 01:33:34.059
and so you have to be able on the fly

01:33:34.059 --> 01:33:36.729
attend to weed that stuff out so there's

01:33:36.729 --> 01:33:41.739
a ton of good tips and and ways to track

01:33:41.739 --> 01:33:44.079
down information and defeat bias and

01:33:44.079 --> 01:33:46.209
groupthink and stuff in there that's

01:33:46.209 --> 01:33:47.320
awesome I'm gonna check that out for

01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.939
sure I feel like in America right now

01:33:48.939 --> 01:33:50.709
the problem is we've somehow been

01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:53.109
massively disillusioned to the point

01:33:53.109 --> 01:33:54.999
where it's like yeah I live in this evil

01:33:54.999 --> 01:33:58.209
empire book everything that yes you know

01:33:58.209 --> 01:34:00.280
and then then you just you have that

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.499
kind of like base level kind of just you

01:34:02.499 --> 01:34:03.939
know again like disillusion or like what

01:34:03.939 --> 01:34:05.289
it what's the point of everything yeah

01:34:05.289 --> 01:34:07.809
then your discrete by these competing

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:09.820
you know news outlets and political

01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:11.530
bodies that are like you know push these

01:34:11.530 --> 01:34:12.999
buttons and click this thing and then a

01:34:12.999 --> 01:34:14.800
you know and you just fall into a camp

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:15.999
and there's end up fighting with people

01:34:15.999 --> 01:34:16.869
online and like you were saying

01:34:16.869 --> 01:34:19.840
meanwhile yeah there's like cranking out

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.399
a gazillion widgets and we're just

01:34:21.399 --> 01:34:23.649
losing all of our skills trying to cube

01:34:23.649 --> 01:34:25.449
stars and it's like you know another

01:34:25.449 --> 01:34:27.550
that it's like what the [ __ ] you know

01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:32.050
good luck yeah and and from it from it

01:34:32.050 --> 01:34:34.719
I'm not saying all of it is related to

01:34:34.719 --> 01:34:37.300
social manipulation and information

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:40.719
warfare but that is the entire purpose

01:34:40.719 --> 01:34:44.769
is disrupting democracies that's the

01:34:44.769 --> 01:34:47.559
that is the goal of your Russia's in

01:34:47.559 --> 01:34:49.419
your China is because in order to

01:34:49.419 --> 01:34:52.719
maintain their authoritarian holds over

01:34:52.719 --> 01:34:55.389
their populations you can't have this

01:34:55.389 --> 01:34:57.909
this democracy over here where everybody

01:34:57.909 --> 01:35:00.999
has freedom in his partying you know you

01:35:00.999 --> 01:35:02.769
can't have that because now everybody's

01:35:02.769 --> 01:35:06.489
going to want that so your your goal and

01:35:06.489 --> 01:35:08.769
definitely one of Russia's primary

01:35:08.769 --> 01:35:11.769
primary interests and goals is to

01:35:11.769 --> 01:35:16.659
disrupt the United States because we're

01:35:16.659 --> 01:35:19.419
the primary enemy so disrupt all of that

01:35:19.419 --> 01:35:21.010
stop get us fighting with each other

01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:24.280
because literally what's happening right

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.300
now and when

01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:27.430
the president was calling out the

01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:31.780
military to stop protests in DC dude

01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:34.570
that's like perfect fodder for a short

01:35:34.570 --> 01:35:37.300
Aryan regime that say hey you think it's

01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:39.070
bad here well look at that you know

01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:41.110
they're doing the same stuff so because

01:35:41.110 --> 01:35:43.540
it's so bad here you know I mean you're

01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:45.640
just feeding into that narrative and and

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.680
that's the what we live and that's why

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:51.490
and the solution has to be that that we

01:35:51.490 --> 01:35:54.570
start caring more about about here and

01:35:54.570 --> 01:35:58.380
that's things that maybe we've been

01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:01.360
we've grown entitled to I don't know if

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.740
that's the right word either and I don't

01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:04.150
want to sound like an [ __ ] but I

01:36:04.150 --> 01:36:05.380
think it is know like it is the right

01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:07.300
word man of just being like you know

01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:09.550
like I should have not even just like I

01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:10.990
should have a house I should have like a

01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:13.750
nicer house and everybody I know it's

01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:16.120
like yeah man yeah that the whole the

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:17.410
one thing from that book that I was

01:36:17.410 --> 01:36:18.850
reading that you sent me

01:36:18.850 --> 01:36:24.120
yeah which make all the difference the

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:26.560
total manipulation I saw the actual

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:27.820
manipulation if like you know in

01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:29.620
democracy there's this idea and this is

01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:31.150
kind of you know it's a strength and a

01:36:31.150 --> 01:36:33.160
weakness that the what is it's like the

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:35.890
unalloyed flow of information is a good

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:38.020
thing it's like yes to an extent

01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:39.580
democracy but it's also a weakness that

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.290
can be you know you can Jim if you're

01:36:41.290 --> 01:36:43.000
you know quote-unquote bad actor you can

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.700
just log jam that full of just like [ __ ]

01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:47.800
designs and on a personal tab and attack

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.200
each other and if people aren't

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:51.070
cognizant of that it works you're

01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:52.540
cognizant of it you see something that's

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:54.640
ridiculous and or scratching some weird

01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.400
bias of yours it's like yeah a minute

01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:58.840
man let that go because you know you

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.640
might not be doing as good of a service

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.500
as you think you are right beaming that

01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:05.290
out and being like look at me and then

01:37:05.290 --> 01:37:07.000
it's a you take people who now have

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.880
almost like through the internet almost

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:11.320
anybody can you know quote-unquote

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:13.330
become like a celebrity at any time it's

01:37:13.330 --> 01:37:15.040
like a lottery thing now yep or it's

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:16.360
like a now you start playing what you

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.350
know like you were saying like you don't

01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:18.910
even show up with the briefcase of cash

01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:21.850
just give people the you know illusion

01:37:21.850 --> 01:37:24.040
that they get it blow up and explode if

01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:25.630
they kind of you know ally themselves a

01:37:25.630 --> 01:37:27.160
certain ideological principles and

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.900
espouse them in a certain way or attack

01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:31.750
other it's crazy Antonius I really do

01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:33.700
feel like the information the different

01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.140
disinformation stuff and all the

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:36.580
information warfare I think is

01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:38.790
personally eating us alive culturally

01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:41.460
and yeah yeah totally and it has been

01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:45.270
has been for a long time in and and it

01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:47.910
in some ways I mean it's a super

01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:50.400
horrible thing that what happened with

01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:53.670
the last election but I I'm glad that

01:37:53.670 --> 01:37:57.210
there's more that that it the topic has

01:37:57.210 --> 01:38:00.000
come up more it's definitely a topic

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.570
that's always discussed in my kind of

01:38:03.570 --> 01:38:06.810
sweater sphere of influence and that the

01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:09.390
circles I travel in but I never feed

01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:11.340
those types of things discussed outside

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:15.480
of that and honestly that the cynical

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.580
side of me says that yeah of course

01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.340
there's not a discussion about hospital

01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:22.260
social manipulation and misinformation

01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:26.780
and disinformation because you are our

01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:30.120
society our economy runs on that in some

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:33.720
ways you know you have you just social

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:35.400
media companies everything runs on

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:37.230
pretty much marketing and advertising

01:38:37.230 --> 01:38:40.950
and and if you start telling people or

01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:43.290
teaching people like critical thinking

01:38:43.290 --> 01:38:46.740
skills and don't react you got to train

01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:49.020
yourself not to react to things and and

01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:51.210
to look at things impartially and try to

01:38:51.210 --> 01:38:54.750
defeat bias and stuff well then you're

01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:56.460
kind of defeating the purpose of

01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:59.250
marketing and advertising work instead

01:38:59.250 --> 01:39:01.500
of just buying that thing that you don't

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:04.320
necessarily need but you feel like you

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.150
feel like you need it because it's in

01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:07.890
your face every five seconds or

01:39:07.890 --> 01:39:09.660
something like that instead of buying

01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:11.370
that thing you're going to stop and

01:39:11.370 --> 01:39:13.650
think well what do I really mean it and

01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:15.840
why are they trying to sell it to me so

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.400
hard and why does this advertisement

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:19.920
follow me across every sight and every

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:23.070
device I go do that kind of stuff yeah

01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:26.010
if you do that then then that's going to

01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:29.820
hurt the economy so so the cynical side

01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.250
of me says that we're not having those

01:39:32.250 --> 01:39:34.920
types of discussions because of that

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:37.820
where it's not in the interests of

01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:41.910
capitalism to do it but as as citizens

01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:44.220
of this country if we like this country

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:46.740
we need to start taking stuff more

01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:49.800
seriously and and forcing more of these

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:52.110
kinds of conversations and

01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:57.840
as citizens we need to take more of more

01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:59.880
I don't know what the right word is but

01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:04.440
more like I know we have to accept more

01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.960
of the burden

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:09.030
I'm not burden I don't know the word

01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:12.540
initiative we house initiative so you

01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:14.940
know word I'm looking for initiative it

01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.860
doesn't sound like ridiculous to be like

01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:18.780
I always laughed at people like I love

01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:20.760
America I'm like okay dude but it is

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.949
like you know it's getting to the point

01:40:22.949 --> 01:40:24.300
where I'm like this is a big deal and

01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.460
it's a young what I feel as I'm watching

01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:28.080
those institutions kind of crumble

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:29.010
around me and I've always you know I

01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:30.510
believe I don't know I don't do this

01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:32.100
because it always felt kind of slimy and

01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:34.469
sleazy doing but it's like you know once

01:40:34.469 --> 01:40:35.730
you kind of get out of that whole thing

01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:36.989
of like yeah I just watch the Ring of

01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:39.929
Power and like you know the financier is

01:40:39.929 --> 01:40:41.219
or keep'em it's like all right well just

01:40:41.219 --> 01:40:43.320
like set up a bank account first before

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:45.449
you worry about like global manipulators

01:40:45.449 --> 01:40:47.730
taking you to it's like it's there one

01:40:47.730 --> 01:40:50.280
yeah College yeah one's gonna prevent

01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:51.600
you from doing that you know no one's

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.520
gonna prevent you know not raining and

01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:55.080
getting better so just try to do that

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.480
before you blame like you know whatever

01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:59.310
I think maybe there's you know yeah I

01:40:59.310 --> 01:41:00.510
don't know I haven't researched that I

01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:02.790
don't know but I can guarantee you the

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:05.040
IMF isn't keeping you from learning the

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.889
skills for you to advance your left

01:41:06.889 --> 01:41:09.510
increments that need to go so you know

01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:11.520
that's where do I like the conspiracy

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:13.020
thinking like the mindset it's just when

01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:15.119
you use it as like oh there's no point

01:41:15.119 --> 01:41:18.960
thing it's like no no no no no yeah I

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:22.170
didn't and and I guess it one of the

01:41:22.170 --> 01:41:25.040
other things people could do is just

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:28.409
start reading I don't know maybe that

01:41:28.409 --> 01:41:30.540
people aren't interested in that I told

01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:33.030
Mimi I don't know but but what it's like

01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:34.679
to in some of these other countries

01:41:34.679 --> 01:41:37.380
where a lot of the we've we've been

01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:39.869
super fortunate in the United States

01:41:39.869 --> 01:41:42.780
where like my entire lifetime and most

01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:45.449
people's entire lifetime we've been on

01:41:45.449 --> 01:41:47.699
top the United States has set the rules

01:41:47.699 --> 01:41:50.010
for the entire country everything runs

01:41:50.010 --> 01:41:50.880
on the dollar

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:53.310
you can borrow as much money as we want

01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:55.980
and we've always said that the rules for

01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:59.400
the entire world and people just follow

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:02.010
those rules well it's not like that

01:42:02.010 --> 01:42:03.590
anymore

01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:06.500
China it there's going to be you know

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:09.140
people smarter people than me talk about

01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:11.990
is the multipolar world where you're

01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:14.120
gonna have a China that has a bigger

01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.760
economy than us I mean they already have

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:19.790
more purchasing power and and they are

01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:23.780
going to be the appear so you have to

01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:25.640
deal with that where you're going to

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.830
have groups of people in the world that

01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:29.840
are going to go one way the other or

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:31.790
they're going to play both sides and you

01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:33.950
have to deal with that we don't we don't

01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:36.800
always get our way anymore so we have to

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.750
start we have to start thinking about

01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:41.840
that as people that live here the world

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:44.420
isn't going to work the way that it has

01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:46.730
since World War two where we make all of

01:42:46.730 --> 01:42:49.070
the rules things are going to get more

01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:52.310
expensive if we pick fights with China

01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:55.220
you know because we've gotten used to

01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:56.930
buying cheap stuff things are going to

01:42:56.930 --> 01:42:58.850
get more expensive when we get into

01:42:58.850 --> 01:43:01.160
fights with them and and things are

01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:04.910
going to get less available these kinds

01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:06.260
of things we have to start thinking

01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:08.270
about and dealing with those types of

01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:10.520
yeah well dude I can't thank you enough

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:12.590
I don't want to take up any more your

01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:14.780
time that was awesome and again we'll

01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:16.550
talk I would love to check in like you

01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:17.750
know months and months from now if

01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:19.190
you're cool with it because I that was

01:43:19.190 --> 01:43:22.190
awesome man that was real I yeah I just

01:43:22.190 --> 01:43:24.100
never thought that usually people

01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:26.450
outside of my normal circles aren't

01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:28.220
interested in this kind of stuff for

01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:31.070
most people I know outside of these

01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:33.170
circles they usually tell me to shut up

01:43:33.170 --> 01:43:35.630
and they don't care so I usually don't

01:43:35.630 --> 01:43:38.180
say nothing but if if people are

01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:40.370
interested in this I certainly I

01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:43.520
certainly it is super important and it's

01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:45.260
something I'm passionate about and I

01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:47.770
want people to be more aware and and

01:43:47.770 --> 01:43:51.380
prepare it are kind of I don't know get

01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:54.950
more smart about what's going on so they

01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:57.020
can protect themselves and be prepared

01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:00.290
for dude the future I mean things are

01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:03.140
definitely going to change you ghovat is

01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:07.370
just you know that i open from the way

01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:10.130
that society can change really fast and

01:44:10.130 --> 01:44:12.320
that's the way the future is going to be

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.210
your when you read through the rest of

01:44:14.210 --> 01:44:17.210
that the those documents or

01:44:17.210 --> 01:44:19.460
if you want to sure about social

01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:22.550
manipulation and and kind of truth decay

01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:25.690
and how democracies and things like that

01:44:25.690 --> 01:44:29.330
yeah I mean you know these virtual

01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:31.219
battle spaces where people are fighting

01:44:31.219 --> 01:44:35.390
for for people's minds and things like

01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:38.060
that are gonna get worse so we need to

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:39.680
be prepared for that

01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:44.180
and think critically more and and try to

01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:47.030
come up with our own answers and not

01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:49.969
those that are just thrown out there for

01:44:49.969 --> 01:44:52.130
who knows whose interests or a lot of

01:44:52.130 --> 01:44:53.870
injuries yeah hopefully does that make

01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:55.700
10 no it definitely does and it's like

01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:56.840
you were saying you start talking to

01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:58.100
people about this and they're I start to

01:44:58.100 --> 01:44:59.180
water because it's like you know I've

01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:00.650
read a thing I was reading Edward

01:45:00.650 --> 01:45:01.969
Bernays book and they talk about that

01:45:01.969 --> 01:45:03.620
how it's like or maybe is another book

01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:05.239
they say how this is like it's like

01:45:05.239 --> 01:45:06.710
letting someone see inside of a sausage

01:45:06.710 --> 01:45:08.570
factory where you're like I'd rather not

01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:10.640
yet made let me just enjoy my you know

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:13.910
Fox and Friends yeah my CNN Don Lennon

01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:16.190
lemon whatever I want to enjoy that

01:45:16.190 --> 01:45:18.350
without knowing how bad it is for feet

01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:20.540
because it's delicious yeah also yeah

01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:24.410
yeah hey just like that I always use the

01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:26.870
end kind of the analogy of it's like the

01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:29.120
matrix where you're inside the matrix

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:31.670
and everything is awesome and then and

01:45:31.670 --> 01:45:33.230
then when you start looking into this

01:45:33.230 --> 01:45:35.810
stuff it's like you fall out of that

01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:38.239
matrix and now you're in though at the

01:45:38.239 --> 01:45:40.190
part of the world where it just sucks

01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:43.700
yes and everything thinks and and you

01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.680
you know it's not this fantasy world

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.840
anymore you know you don't get to have

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:54.140
that that steak will do like what it's

01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:56.360
important that people know this stuff is

01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.790
going on and can protect themselves yeah

01:45:58.790 --> 01:46:00.650
I think it is I think it's it's an is

01:46:00.650 --> 01:46:02.420
intensely important it's one it's

01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:03.890
something that I rail on about but I

01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:05.840
always am limited by the fact that I'm

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.969
like I just don't know but I feel

01:46:07.969 --> 01:46:09.920
something's amiss and I can never so I

01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:11.150
really feel like you help that out

01:46:11.150 --> 01:46:13.310
big-time so that's that's awesome yeah

01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:15.410
under percentage if you have questions

01:46:15.410 --> 01:46:17.870
or want to talk again or other people

01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:19.610
there's stuff that that you've always

01:46:19.610 --> 01:46:21.650
been curious about if it's something

01:46:21.650 --> 01:46:24.050
that's on my research list already I'll

01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:26.660
definitely share all of it with with

01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:28.790

01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:30.590
are particular books or topic

01:46:30.590 --> 01:46:33.860
or anything that I've said is based on

01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:35.750
