00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.799
standards as well no exactly

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.040
what are we talking about so i had uh i

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.040
had an ambitious young dog come on

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.159
to talk about incels and you know and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:20.960
while he was

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.040
he gave this theory or he gave like his

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.400
thesis but it was like i thought this

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.320
was a dude who had like a phd level

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.080
like understanding and had like research

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.159
and data and he was just like yo i'm 22

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:30.720
years old

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.159
i just wrote a college paper and i was

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.920
just like [ __ ]

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.840
[ __ ] yeah [ __ ] and then i didn't i

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.200
didn't have it in me to be like

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.640
yo timeout dude like yeah no so

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.240
i felt bad i personally felt bad about

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.520
what honestly that's one of those things

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.680
where like you have to do that

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.360
i could have saved him literally i wrote

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.640
in the letter to patreon people like i

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.320
could have saved him from like 65

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.960
[ __ ] yeah i think he did him a favor

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.320
i think you did him a favor you have his

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.360
exposure therapy

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.040
true you gave him [ __ ] exposure

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.439
i would not be the man i am today if i

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.759
was not called a [ __ ] for 15 years in

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.439
a row on the internet

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.920
up to and including now that was funny

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.720
too because when we were

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.319
talk at one point i was like yeah i mean

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.599
it's nice to hear kyle he was saying

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.360
like college now if you go there

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.360
like as long as if you're just open

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.040
about who you are people yeah whatever

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.160
and i'm like man that's nice to hear

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.040
because when i went to college

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.800
everyone's like fear of [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.239
uh he was like no i mean

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.599
trust me man i got my fair share of

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.200
[ __ ] i remember my head being like i

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.680
don't think

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.000
yeah right i'm up in like the hundreds

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
of thousands

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.720
like my brother literally tried to

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.400
convince me i was gay when i was yeah

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.720
dude my sister told my parents i was gay

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.160
for months yeah my mom still to this day

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.200
thinks i'm gay

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.680
really i would say

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.800
because you know you know when you're

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.480
not a certain way in a black community

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.480
you're gay i would say as a guy i was

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.360
just about to say

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.360
there is no one more on the pulse of

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.959
who's gay than black women

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.680
yes they're very much they pretty much

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.560
go at like

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.239
what is like the null hypothesis so they

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.920
just assume you're gay unless you

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.760
prove otherwise basically it's like if

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.860
you

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.519
[Laughter]

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.720
if you dump them you're gay

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.640
my my ex-wife her

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.280
her mom was having problems in her

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.080
marriage

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.360
and i was like you know like

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.159
we had to go to the bahamas i got

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.920
tricked into a bahama vacation but it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.959
was really

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.519
a spy mission for my ex-mother-in-law to

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.840
see if her husband was gay

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.400
we went down to the bahamas she's like

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.000
oh i got to get stuff out of the house

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.840
didn't tell us like oh he's supposed to

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.720
be there

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.080
she thought she was going to catch him

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.720
with [ __ ]

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.140
she

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.280
[Laughter]

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.120
she thought she assumed because i

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.239
remember right now i was like picking up

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.000

and she was like i think we should go to

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.519

[ __ ]

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.000
only thing that needs to occur is

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.759
something to make a black woman's head

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.400

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.120
it was it was all a ploy for me to try

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.479
stand-up comedy for the first time

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:41.120
that's what's up

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.800
so that's like i was going to host it

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.400
and i had all these jokes and i was

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.680
going to come out and do material after

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.360
each act awesome so

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.479
how old were you it was what 16. perfect

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.400
that's awesome yeah yeah so funny you

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.520
staged this

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.720
basically and then uh so the girl that i

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.000
was with she also wanted to do some

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.840
hosting too and i was just like [ __ ]

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.919
this is my idea i didn't want her to get

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.280
yoko'd off the bed

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.319
well basically but when she once uh her

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:07.440
and i had a kind of

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.880
a talk and i explained to her what my

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.960
goal was she started to take a back seat

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.680
okay now

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.800
the advisor and her were friends we had

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.360
all sorts of acts we had uh a magician

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.120
off the bat had to deal with like real

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.560
showbiz problems

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.560
take it easy babe take it you're like a

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.840
producer of this big show you're like

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.199
all right i'll get you on the next one

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.280
basically that's basically what it was i

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.800
had we had singers

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.599
we had uh dancing we had dancers we had

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.039
dancers we had a step team

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:37.440
of course yeah right and then uh we had

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.639
were they competing against each other

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:39.039
or just

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:40.960
no it was going to be a show okay just

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.160
an all-out show

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.360
and just everyone's gonna have a good

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.199
time and

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:47.759
the the advisor really liked the rap

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.120
group that we had

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.960
and then her idea was like well why

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.319
don't we just

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:55.039
make this a rap step she just wanted to

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:57.759
make it a black thing

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.440
of course the magician was white yeah

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.879
you know one of the singers was white

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:01.680
true you know

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.560
one of the dance groups and then it was

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.000
a black rap group

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.400
and a step step team and she was like

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.919
let's make this all black

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:12.240
yeah and i didn't want to do that we had

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.520
these people that already dedicated

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.240
their time

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.840
for sure they were coming after school

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.440
to come practice in our performance

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.960
space that we went out and rented for

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.759
them

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:22.319
and so i i was against it and i was like

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:24.000
i don't want to do that

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.960
and she was like

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:28.960
that's basically how she left it the

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.560
next day she went into her home room

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.039
because you know

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:33.039
as a homeroom teacher told all of her

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.360
students that i was gay

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.159
all of them like she she was going off

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.440
and

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.919
basically expressing that i didn't have

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.200
the courage

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.279
to put on a rap show so i was gay

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:50.800
pretty solid checks out checks out dude

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.399
dude there's nothing gayer in the black

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:55.360
community than the rappers

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.200
it's a high level conspiracy it is it's

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.399
a high level because of you if you're

00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.120
willing to go to

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.080
choose to believe it if you're willing

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.360
to go there i'm not afraid of the

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.880
illuminati you know who's perfect to

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.480
talk dude keith from up the block has

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.320
more knowledge about gay black rappers

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.600
yeah or just gay rappers in general

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.480
although i don't know if people

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.000
ever call i mean no one ever calls white

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.320
rappers into like the gay conspiracy

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.000
i think that's what gets them out of it

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.200
i think i think a lot of them have a

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.399
hard time because they don't they don't

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:17.200
expect that

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.959
to come they think it's a myth yeah and

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:20.240
then when it when when it

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.320
gets offered to them they're like people

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.040
always say that eminem's gay

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.800
true i thought they always really i

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.760
thought they were always saying like he

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.680
said [ __ ] so much because he's gay

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.920
right that's fair he also is that can

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.880
that happen

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.200
he got caught hugging elton john too

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.839
case closed

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.200
i mean any black woman could pick that

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.959
up

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:42.399
yeah i mean that uh and then name a

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.160
different white rapper

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.399
everlast never got called gay they're

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:48.240
all they were they were before they were

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.839
too early

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:51.040
sparks nobody called public sparks okay

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.480
nobody called i won't hear it

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.160
i won't hear it if they did nobody came

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.480
at paul wall's neck for being gay

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.240
but he also has a lot of grills i think

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.600
that prevents

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.880
that kind of deflection yeah you're not

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.800
sucking bird in that kind of grill well

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.200
baby got called so there was everyone

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.880
from cash money is like it's a it's

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.279
there's

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:09.440
an actual thing that like baby is

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.120
bisexual him and little wayne were

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.160
having sex

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.519
yeah they made things they both out at

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:16.880
each other on that and then there's

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.440
things saying like jay-z love [ __ ]

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.200
i don't know that's not gay obviously

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.800
not jay-z straight as can be

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.480
the but yeah there's a whole conspiracy

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.320
like every high-level

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.680
rapper is also gay hmm oh

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.440
dude i have a whole theory on this and

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.440
uh what is it i did it well i did a

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.279
thesis on it basically

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.279
i read a lot of internet comments about

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:38.480
it

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.680
and uh my you know i'm upset about it

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.160
i won't say any of their names because

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.800
dude i want

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.640
dude i bust chops all right i don't i

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.399
don't mind saying so i bust chops and i

00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.200
bust cheeks

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.640
you're rising i like that dude i would

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.399
love it if that incel was

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:06.880
doing your undercover podcast on you

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.160
you got triple psyoppt that would be so

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:10.959
sick

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:12.640
like it's still you were secretly on his

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.120
podcast

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.880
because you're going to have them back

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.839
on to make up for that episode

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:22.720
and that's when the real psyop begins

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.000
[ __ ] dude

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.640
i think i might be an intel now

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.880
yeah i would probably be an insult if i

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.880
never had kids

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.160
yeah i mean yeah i don't know i

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.920
well it's it's fun it sucks too that's

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.120
what we were talking about on the thing

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.560
it's like

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.640
everyone's hit dry speak dry streaks but

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.560
it's like now if you hit a dry streak

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.839
for a long enough time you're now an

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:46.880
intel like i was just yeah that's what

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.920
i'm saying between getting [ __ ] you're

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.480
not getting [ __ ] but if you hit like

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.399
five if there was an incel forum for me

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:53.519
to look into while i

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:55.760
wasn't getting [ __ ] for nine months i

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.600
would have committed dude i'd have been

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.200
i would have identified as an incel and

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.800
been like i'm an incel now

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.399
yeah and then when i went to talk to

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:03.519
chicks it would have been in the back of

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:05.040
my head then yeah i'm an incel

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.120
if i didn't exist i was just like it's

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.959
on the horizon it's coming it's coming

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:10.959
now you could be 17 and not get [ __ ]

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:12.800
for like two years effectively

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.320
and be an instant time to buy a

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.000
flamethrower dude go kill people about

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.959
it

00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:19.200
i dude i if if i didn't accidentally

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.839
trap my wife at 22 i'd i would 100 be an

00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:23.360
insult right now i'd be managing a game

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:23.920
stop

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.839
living in a storage unit and [ __ ]

00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:27.279
loving it

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:30.320
god that would be so sick

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.480
god damn i'm actually i'm converting

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.000
dude i'm going to be an incel well i do

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.839
like i think your point is very fair

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:36.320
about

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.839
before you came bundley was basically

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:39.519
saying it's not like because the thesis

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:41.120
was like there's

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.079
these people are like being incellized

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:45.600
into becoming mass murderers like it's

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.560
al-qaeda

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.000
yeah and buttery's thesis is more like

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.720
they're just dudes on the on the road to

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.320
mass murder them you're not getting a

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.279
lot of [ __ ]

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.040
yeah you know yeah like the traits that

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.600
make you someone who will kill people

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.480
at the library will make you an incel

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.079
not the other way around dude yeah

00:13:04.079 --> 00:13:05.600
people pick up on that like elliot roger

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.560
i'm sorry i didn't mean to speak his

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.920
name dude that's what he wants

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.920

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.160
yeah you did a book report on internet

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.079
comments i like i know i looked at a

00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:57.519
vice documentary i was like wow that

00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:59.279
guy's skinny and tall and i'm like

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.880
in the data bank because it was like

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.240
usually i thought it was all scotties

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.000
but it was just like a tall like ichabod

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
crane looking guys oh a jack skellington

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.959
frame yeah

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.520
um but yeah the that dude was it insane

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.720
jack's killing him they didn't sell too

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.919
he just wanted to be santa didn't want

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:14.720
to [ __ ]

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.959
trill he was all about the [ __ ] suit

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:18.319
well true

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:21.919
the uh the weird so there there's also

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:23.280
research on

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.120
i think like real research on online

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.880
dating how it just like

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.319
well dude this is actually kind of weird

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:29.840
because i i read an article about the

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.400
family

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.720
in the atlantic about their their last

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.360
article was the nuclear family

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.799
dash was a lie so and

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:41.760
do it so this is weird to me because

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.280
culturally speaking right

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.960
so white people are pressured to make a

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.039
family right but there isn't

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:48.799
there doesn't seem to be an emphasis on

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:50.240
on teaching

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.360
uh white guys how to [ __ ]

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.799
right it's like the opposite in the

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:57.120
black community it's like early on like

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.799
you get you you get learned how to [ __ ]

00:17:58.799 --> 00:18:00.320
but it's like there's no emphasis on

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.440
making the family

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.000
that's crazy none that's why i mean it's

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.520
like it's kind of tough

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.160
it's tough to be an incel as a black guy

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.679
because of the cultural pressure because

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:10.160
again

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.000
black women if you don't if you're not

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.400
able to [ __ ] for too long you're gay

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.000
yeah that's just how that works so it's

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.679
there are black cells there's black in

00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:21.120
cells yeah but they

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.440
animate blacks there's they prefer

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.640
excuse me they're yeah

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:29.840
anime american americans

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.679
excuse me if they feel the pressure

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:35.120
they feel the pressure too oh for sure

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.799
what i mean that's that's why they

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:37.360
retreat

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.280
into that into that world it's like they

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.280
try to i feel like there's a point

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.640
there's there's a point where uh

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.480
you know like like white people seem to

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.000
try to obfuscate themselves from the

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.559
responsibility of trying to [ __ ]

00:18:50.559 --> 00:18:52.240
okay i heard that you know what i mean

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.080
okay i like this where you're going dude

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:54.799
yeah it's like

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:56.000
a if you're an intel you're just not

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.240
cat-calling hard enough basically

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.240
okay i can see that actually basically

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.640
sure it's you're not allowed to

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.160
give up as a black person also too

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.120
there's

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.640
as a as a white insole it's like

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.039
have you tried to increase your drip

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:14.799
what's your chain looking like do all

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:16.720
your clothes match

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.559
are all the colors identical in every

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:20.400
item of your clothes you're wearing

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.000
how dark do your transition legs

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.400

guy fridays

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:33.120
that makes a lot of sense

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.039
i do i

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.000
agree with that they're being totally

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.600
passive in this they are they're

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.480
thinking

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.919
yeah you got it they got to start but

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:47.280
this is where the pickup if you try to

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.760
grill yet

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.240
if elliot rogers would have tried to

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.559

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.480
i mean yeah dude i mean have

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.320
but that gets in a pickup artist white

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.159
dudes get tricked into the psychology of

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:03.280
dating when they should be learning how

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.480
to [ __ ]

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.760
yeah they'll get real and they'll start

moms i don't know if they could i got my

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.320
mother's a gosh but you know i assumed

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.120
that they weren't because they were

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.600
white

they possibly had dads in the picture

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.120
but it was

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.480
you know you shouldn't be asking other

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.799
people's wives those types of questions

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:44.480
yeah that's possible i went down a

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:44.960
really

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.159
really deep pua mgtow rabbit hole

years ago

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.600
man the content used to just be

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.799
incredible it used to be one of my

00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:55.600
favorite

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.679
genres of content on the internet the uh

00:21:57.679 --> 00:21:58.640
they

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.080

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.200
dragon shirt complicated hat dudes

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.280
just [ __ ] assaulting assaulting women

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.120
crazy and then the mgtow dudes when you

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.360
pua too hard you go mgtow

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.919
and then that's when you're like i don't

00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:14.799
leave the house

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:16.559
mgtows were like the birth of the incel

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:18.400
movement

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.480
men men going their own way and that's

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.559
like those were the dudes that started

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:24.000
like the chad [ __ ]

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.840
i think they were like women are

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.440
worthless don't even waste your time so

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:27.840

cops called enough times as a pua

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:33.600
and then you lock yourself in front of a

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.600
[ __ ] webcam and you're like women are

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.880

yeah they don't do anything else though

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.520
they don't replace women with something

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.400

to be living in in a community with

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.640
other people so everyone's kind of

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.240

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.159
able to [ __ ] people that you met at the

00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:52.880
supermarket

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.720
yes that's what people's parents met but

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.799
dude as a girl on tinder and dude

00:23:56.799 --> 00:23:58.880
maybe i'm crazy but there has to be just

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.080
like imagine

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.640
just being like swiping on dudes and

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.480
being like data

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.320
like you know like ceo you're like i

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.919
could be a ceo's wife and that you know

00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:08.960
you're [ __ ]

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.600
boom you're portaling there has to be

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.440
there's obviously there's dudes out here

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.799
who are like i'm gonna [ __ ] come on

00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:16.320
this girl there's definitely chicks who

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.200
are like

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.520
portering imagine if you're just like

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.200
and there was a teleporting for just

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.640
different lives you could have

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.120
you're like that guy's on tv quantum

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:25.760
leaping

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.279
yeah you're like i could be on jumpers

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:29.520
dude i could be on tv [ __ ] yeah

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.120
that would be i wouldn't be able to stop

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.960
doing that if i could just

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.440
radically change my life yeah i guess

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.159
that'd be pretty cool

00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:38.159
again obviously obviously there's you

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:39.200
know it's like people

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.400
there's women who just you're just

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.080
trying to get [ __ ] sure and that's

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.279
awesome too you're just definitely

00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:44.799
getting [ __ ] left and right

00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:46.960
but there has to be because it's like if

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.480
the selection of

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.720
you know men on there is correlated with

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.559
like obviously being chad's and all that

00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:54.159
but like dude if you

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:56.640
were like you have like a and e credits

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.679
where you like are

00:24:57.679 --> 00:24:59.600
alex trebek you're going to get a bunch

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.039
of women and they're not just

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:03.360
they just don't want to [ __ ] alex trebek

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.400
you're on tv

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.600
so there's an element to it where

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.360
they're like oh i could have a different

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.480
life oh i could have this and they

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.440
there's just like

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.039
it's just they have a menu now it's not

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:12.400
like whatever the chef's gonna give you

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:12.799
now

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:13.919
it's like you don't have to try your

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:15.279
luck at all you get what you see is what

00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:16.320
you get well usually

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.600
yeah and circles i think now they know

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.440
everyone's end circumstantially

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.640
so if you were from like small town x

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.559
you're gonna [ __ ] somebody from small

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:25.919
town x you're not there's no

00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:29.120
online portal to then move beyond that

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.559
for the most part for a long time ago

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:31.919
that's too much power for a woman like a

00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:33.360
woman a woman still needs to feel like

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.360
she's aspiring to a guy

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.679
for it to fully work you know because

00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:38.640
that's that's how

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.960
like women are conditioned to like pick

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.559
the the best

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:44.640
you know most substantial guy that they

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.760
can find is going to like

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.919
you know uh shepherd them through all of

00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:49.279
the chaos that's going to come through

00:25:49.279 --> 00:25:51.919
into the world right so you know like

00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:53.039
with with all that

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.799
well they're designed to maximize that

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:56.240
exactly then you hit him with the tool

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.039
and they're like oh

00:25:57.039 --> 00:25:58.559
well they're literally instincts are

00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:00.559
like i gotta go i gotta go higher and it

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.480
devalues that for them

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.320
it devalues their ability to pick a

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.919
substantial guy which is why women

00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:07.440
always end up with shitty guys now

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.640
because they're not picking for the

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.880
qualities that

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.480
work they're skipping the training dude

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.159
basically yeah yeah you used to be

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:16.000
somewhere with a person all day every

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.520
day you'd watch their program and be

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.640
like you don't get your lightsaber on

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.520
the first day

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.120
yeah that's exactly exactly yeah you'll

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.559
cut yourself in and it's also like so

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:23.520
you have people who

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.520
put together a curated presentation of

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.960
themselves through like instagram all

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.679
the stuff

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:29.440
and then people are attracted to like

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.039
the mirage of that person

00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:32.400
but then trying to work it out people

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.760
also convince themselves that they

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.000
understand the language of looking at a

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
picture and being able to read a person

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.600
like ansley's watching this show called

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.200
the circle on netflix

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.600
it's a social media reality show where

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.559
everybody is

00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:47.440
kind of secluded in their own space and

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.960
they can only interact with each other

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.360
through this social media app that is

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.400
designed for the show

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.760
so they can see pictures and stuff of

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.520
people but that's it like no

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.600
voice no interaction just all type and

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.559
pictures

00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:00.720
and a person will put up a picture that

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.159
the whole group can see

00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:04.559
and then you'll see people analyzing the

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:05.360
picture

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.760
and drawing information that they're

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.960
using to

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.760
like then say okay i get this person

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.360
like oh they put that picture up

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.799
of them with their shirt off at the

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:16.799
beach oh but there's a dog in the

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:18.159
picture so they're not really showing

00:27:18.159 --> 00:27:18.720
off their

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.919
they're really showing that they're

00:27:19.919 --> 00:27:20.960
friendly and compassionate it's like

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.320
what the [ __ ]

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.480
wow like i've never put a wild idea for

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.919
a show how old are the people on this

00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:26.960
show

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.799
they they seem to be anywhere between

00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:32.840
like 22 and 30. i wish it was like 50 to

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.679
60

00:27:35.679 --> 00:27:36.930
it's mostly ceiling

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.360
[Laughter]

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.300
they all look like kyle from tenacious d

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:46.159
[Laughter]

00:27:46.159 --> 00:27:49.120
dude that's well so that's that's what

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:49.760
they're saying is

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.399
has led that has set up this like mgtow

00:27:52.399 --> 00:27:54.480
in cell thing where it's like

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.880
it it can be a desert and then again i i

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.320
think it's partly psychological where

00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:58.880
it's like

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.880
so once you identify as in cell and then

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.000
you're up against this weird

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.240
kind of technology aspect to dating

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.520
which i would that's

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.440
kind of sucks to have to do yeah but

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.960
dude so there i read the article in the

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.240
atlantic it said

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.200
that the so they were saying that like i

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.559
thought people always got married early

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:16.000
they were saying in the 1870s

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.360
people didn't get married until they

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.279
were 26 on average

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:21.360
because at first it was like if it was

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.799
75 of people

00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:24.399
worked on farms with like your whole

00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:26.080
extended family so

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.080
in like the late 1800s that was like the

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.000
kin network where you'd be with your can

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.520
and you would just all your whole family

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.039
would work on a farm and 25 percent of

00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:34.880
people had like dry good shops and [ __ ]

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.360
and then when factories came out the

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.799
younger people were like

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:40.559
[ __ ] it i'm gonna go work for a factory

00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:42.000
and the nuclear family

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.640
basically was a mutation of factory work

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.159
to where like you we've all usually

00:28:46.159 --> 00:28:47.679
lived in weird little bands of extended

00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:48.799
family in kin

00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:50.080
and then like when you went to the

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.000
factory i guess because of like the work

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.960
schedule and the

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.120
regimented nature of it they then were

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.399
like well we need somewhere nice because

00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:57.200
people are and then

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.240
if you were between 1950 and 1965 you

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:00.880
were

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.200
statistically likely to make 400 more

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.480
than your parents because you got

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.279
hitched

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:07.279
into factory work which was like there's

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:08.399
like living off the land

00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:10.159
then there's like infinite production of

00:29:10.159 --> 00:29:11.440
goods that can be shipped all over the

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.559
place and bought

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:13.840
and now you're living in these work

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.279
communities yes now you get paid and

00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:17.760
they said the suburbs from 1950 to 1965

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.120
were like a freak occurrence

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.799
so people are striving for the suburban

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:22.480
life that was like a fluke base

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.320
according to this article and then like

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.679
you know it was and even in that

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:27.840
suburban thing it was like back then

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.520
like everyone's door was unlocked in the

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.039
suburbs like everyone like just your

00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:32.240
neighbors or the kids would run into

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.600
your house open your fridge so it's very

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.279
much like that extended family on the

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:35.919
farm

00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:37.360
and then it was just like you know those

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.360
economic conditions just evaporated now

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.880
people are just trying to hang tight to

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.279
that

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.559
and then they're saying like this was a

00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:44.720
[ __ ] freak it was like a fleet

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.320
fleeting phenomenon that's like not

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.200
going to happen

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.080
weird and people live in the suburbs now

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.559
and it's like dude that was the pinnacle

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:55.600
like the suburbs were like the like

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.600
literally the dream like it's like a

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.880
civilization dream

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.799
right and people live in there and like

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:03.039
i'm [ __ ] bored

00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:05.360
this stuff i used to be afraid of that

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.399
i've only ever lived in the inner city

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:11.360
always i i can't imagine what it's like

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.640
it always seemed kind of cool but my

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.559
favorite portrayal of the suburbs is

00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:16.960
halloween that's like the movie

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.240
halloween yeah i love the way the

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.760
neighborhood looked how

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.640
the halloween night looked like an

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.600
awesome time there was one

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.720
one part that was one part i didn't like

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.320
but the rest of it dude i i've always

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.000

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.200

but i i turned to my wife watching

00:30:39.919 --> 00:30:41.919

sid's wife is tougher than him and his

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.119
only hope of winning a fight would be

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:19.359
killing her in a car accident

00:35:19.359 --> 00:35:21.040

five miles per hour over the speed limit

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.359
and just out of like

00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:35.760
that spiteful tone of voice it was like

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.480
