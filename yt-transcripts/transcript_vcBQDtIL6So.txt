00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.659
[Music]

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:14.639
[Music]

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.599
no you don't want nada

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:31.760
[Music]

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.680
wild wes

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.840
i agree with you i think as soon as a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.520
black lady listens to smooth jazz all

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.239
her hair falls out

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.559
she goes bald is sleek like bald sleek

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.120
and hot oh dude she just has like

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.280
out of nowhere she's got like 50 very

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.079
like

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.199
clangly wrist jewelry things bracelets i

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.559
think they're called in the black

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.320
community

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.320
she's just clacking while like

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.920
talking with her hands at like a teacher

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.280
conference becomes like a literature

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.960
like a high school literature teacher

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.840
yeah

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.080
just vibed out yeah does a lot of spoken

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080
word poetry oh yeah

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.680
yeah dude the smooth jazz shit's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.760
fascinating i that blew my mind that it

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.119
i buddily i thought you were onto

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.200
something thinking it got absolutely

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.640
tiger woods

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.920
respectfully

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.840
that it was just kenny g obviously i

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.840
think it's funny jb is consumed by black

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.439
ladies

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.360
mostly that's what that album cover is

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.119
all about true and when you hear smooth

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.360
jet when black women hear smooth jazz

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.640
there is a part of them that's like i

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.320
should get a loft apartment and just

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.240
like make very intricate salads and just

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.840
have a lot of opinions at parent tv for

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.360
your conferences that's all that's all i

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.040
can think about

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.640
that's probably one part of it then

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.560
there's also it was like the number one

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.439
anthem of offices everywhere in the 90s

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.840
so it was like the only acceptable thing

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.000
yeah so that's that is kind of now that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.240
i think about that 90s were another

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.320
hard pc period so

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.320
it's like the safest thing is to turn on

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.600
like

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.200
but then you realize it's like oh this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.320
guy's appropriating jazz yeah it is the

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.159
background is the background music for

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.200
every cd-rom from the 90s

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.119
that's why kenny g got paid so hard yeah

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.800
bonnie james is more that's a deep cut

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.000
for you guys you'd have to be a real

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.680
smooth jazz head like myself to know

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.490
about bonnie james smooth jazz brain

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.280
[Laughter]

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.200
god damn it yeah kenny g used to send

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.560
the chinese home

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.640
yeah

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.720
they would play a song by kenny g called

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.160
going home at the end of the work day in

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
china it was mandated

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.640
yeah all across the land it was made no

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.000
i swear to god we talked about the rice

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.760
fields and [ __ ]

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.680
i believe unless i just have dreams

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.040
where i talk about stuff on the podcast

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.800
and i don't but i yeah dude that was a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.599
song

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.280
it was an official song they would play

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.640
in china so his

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.319
song got i don't know it's like i don't

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.000
know if a government has to buy it but

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.879
it was like that was their closing time

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.120
that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.440
it just everywhere you're at every day

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.640
it came on and it's basically the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.920
chinese government be like go the [ __ ]

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.760
home right now it was probably actually

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.200
like uh

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.120
like you know the ip theft everything it

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.560
was probably like a chinese knock off of

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.159
kenny g that wasn't there's no way it

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.640
was the real thing dude

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.879
there was a guy with his daughter he was

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.959
like she was blasting uh kenny g on a

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.560
clarinet and he was like i've been

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.159
training her whole life for this and she

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.920
was just

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.519
so yeah i mean that's

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.080
it's not hard yeah you've got a lot on

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.200
the treetops

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.720
you're in china a lot of kids who are

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.200
like ripping oboz and stuff perfectly

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.280
yeah they have an oboe and child surplus

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.519
that is a funny uh i wish i had that

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.200
kind of trope going on where it's like

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.120
you know how my parents are they're just

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.000
pushing me towards excellence ruthlessly

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.280
it's like oh yeah i could use some of

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.760
that that would have been nice man yeah

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.280

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.760
just disappointed that i'm not a doctor

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.599
my parents are more like

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.599

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.319
anonymously

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:03.520
it's crazy you have to show themselves

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.280
they kind of well it depends for

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.039
copyright they do have to show you like

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:08.639
their email address

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.080
this i don't know this is like apparent

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.599
this might be automated i don't know it

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:13.280
might be because if you the thing we

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.759
read if you disagree with the who they

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:17.280
can strike you down

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.479
yeah

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:19.599
it's a weird territory we're getting

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:22.000
into if you disagree with an institution

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.680
it's like what if they're [ __ ] wrong

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.639
bro

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:26.080
what if what if they're wrong about one

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.120
i want to trial by combat

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.039
who name your champion did you ever hear

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:32.880
about the doctor that would be sick did

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.080
you ever hear about the doctor i think

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.839
his name was semmelweiss

00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:38.399
he was the guy who discovered germs

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:41.279
before louis pasteur

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:43.039
i just read a book about people in paris

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.480
so now i'm like totally french but it

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.240
was before the pasta

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.680
did uh the germs there was a guy

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.480
semmelweis who was he was a doctor

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.480
and he was working in a

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.440
like

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.279
like wherever you deliver babies like a

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:56.480
nursery board or whatever [ __ ]

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.480
delivery delivery there's a word bro i'm

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.760
a maternity woman i'm more of a science

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.279
guy i don't know all these words i'm

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:03.279
just i just i'm pure like binary but

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.399
yeah

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.839
so back then they called it delivery

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:07.200
awards maternity the word wasn't

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.399
invented yet i think they called it the

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:11.200
[ __ ] [ __ ] box back then

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.440
yeah

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.519
but it was like i think

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:18.240
25 of women were dying in these he was

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.519
in austria

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:21.920
and this is pro i guess in the whenever

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.279
before people knew about germs like

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.800
mid-1850s

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.320
whenever maybe it was early i don't know

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.440
but

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.519
he was like dude

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:31.920
how come at this one place

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.839
none of the ladies are dying and all the

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.519
other places all the other [ __ ] boxes

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:36.399
25

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:37.600
are checking out

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.800
and they're all showing the same

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.720
symptoms so he's like i got to figure

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.000
out what it is he tried like laying them

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.360
on their sides and doing all this other

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.279
stuff trying to tell them to shut up

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:47.279
did you guys shut up this is [ __ ] in

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:48.480
your heads

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.720
you're not dead i tried telling them

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.399
that their enemies were fat

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:54.240
i've tried everything that i can to help

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.480
these [ __ ] women they keep dying dude

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.560
so what here's what he figured out

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.320
so what they were doing in like you know

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.680
i guess this was like a general like

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.240
medical center because the doctors were

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.079
doing autopsies

00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:07.920
so they would do autopsies and then just

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.440
be like

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.440
and then go it would cut a dead body out

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.959
man like you're closing cinnamon toast

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:15.519
punch and then exactly

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:16.959
done with that and then they'd go

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:19.040
deliver a baby and they would transfer

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.240
dead people germs into a woman's vagina

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.640
so he figured this out it was autopsies

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.880
and he said look after you do an autopsy

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.959
you gotta rub your hands with like lime

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:30.560
and like some other thing and there's

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.079
some [ __ ] on dead bodies that we're

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:34.240
putting into girls vaginas and killing a

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.519
quarter of the women who come into

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:37.760
hospitals to deliver babies

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.240
dude so this theory came out and he he

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.240
demonstrated it he was like i have one

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.320
percent of people dying as opposed to 25

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.440
and this is why

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.600
the phil prominent philadelphia doctor

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.920
was like well doctors are gentlemen and

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.600
gentlemen's hands are clean and

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.079
everyone's like yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] you

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:55.920
yeah

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.760
gentlemen's hands are [ __ ] clean yeah

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.000
those people

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.200
he ended up getting kicked out of the

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.959
medical community and died in an insane

00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:06.720
hospital which which one the guy that's

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.480
when hands are clean or no the hands the

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.839
guy the gentleman

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:11.600
just kept being a kick-ass dog tried to

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.959
invent washing your hands and they were

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:15.279
like no [ __ ] they were like [ __ ] you

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:17.920
that's for poor people we're a gentleman

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.440
and we don't have dirty hands these

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.360
girls are dying because they're dumb it

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.680
has nothing to do with us chopping dead

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.920
bodies up and then delivering babies

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.000
this was dude this game this was like

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.839
maybe late eighteen hundreds

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:31.120
yeah seven weeks dude he ended up

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.120
[ __ ] dying from a [ __ ] up infection

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.480
ironically enough it's so funny to

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.079
imagine a guy going to deliver a baby in

00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:38.320
the 1800s like instead of like the glove

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.040
down the arm it's just

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.720
just be like man i just chopped up this

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.200
dead kid i just chopped up a dead mom oh

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.800
hey here we go

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.000
yeah pretty funny that was that was

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.320
making me laugh i mean because

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.880
that is funny to to think that like if

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.560
you're a gentleman and she's dying and

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.320
she's clearly a [ __ ]

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.040
true that was kind of the

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.399
that was the thing back then if women

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:03.920
would lose their mind they'd be like

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.000
she's an immoral [ __ ]

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.320
imagine how dirty asses were back

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.120
i mean it was it wasn't even like

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.120
you couldn't even comprehend

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.399
when did they come out with toilet paper

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:19.839
no prods

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.519
get on that dude autopsies must have

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:23.360
been sick back then too

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.959
just like a person and be like i don't

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:27.120
know

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:31.200
ew dude he's also full of gods

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.120

my fans what did you do after you pooped

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:44.720

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.720
a towel yeah i think it's just a river

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.560
yeah just like water yeah what was it

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.560

that's one you can say you know i

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.120

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:35.840
the airport parking lot thing the guy

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.440
man that's private business i'm talking

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.760

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:48.480
or maybe the ppa had a had their hand in

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.919
it but someone might know they run the

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:52.160

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.360
schedule obviously they were like hold

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.480
on a second

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.000
these sales numbers

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.440
aggressively accuse you of stealing

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.880
they're never even saying they didn't

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.720
accuse me they were just like yeah we'll

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.080

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.080
they let it go

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.440
wow maybe they thought you're actually

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.200
maybe they're like you're right hiring a

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.080
[ __ ] brutish man did bring our sales

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.320
down

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.559
yeah that was uh that was sick and then

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:46.400
i had then i went to brewster's and that

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.240
brewster's a little more complicated but

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.320
they showed me the free baby cone button

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.080
so you had to like hit the buttons and

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.919
it rung up everything automatically like

00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:56.000
but if you give someone a free baby cone

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.600
hit free baby cone it zeroes out the

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.279
register so if anything landed on a

00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:01.600
totally even number i would go free baby

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.960
cone the register would open i would

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.080
take the money

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.600
hold my fist and like act like i was

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.960
messing with bills and put it in and if

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.919
it was like someone got like a thing

00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:10.480
that was exactly 40 bucks i'd go bingo

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.240
and i would take keep the 40 bucks

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.360
sometimes

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.039
i got greedy i got sloppy towards the

00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:17.200
end and my boy we always do my boys

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.640
would come and they just wouldn't give

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.159
me any money i'd give them all ice cream

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:21.760
and then like hold on i'd hit free baby

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.120
cone open the register and just hand

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.760
them money back

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.840
i was a nightmare i have a bad i have

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.320
bad employment karma

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.919
yeah so what is because i got slighted

00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:33.520
if i if they didn't slight me i'd be as

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.600
honest as could be yeah as soon as they

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.840
slighted me i say all right there you

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.279
ever think maybe you're too sensitive

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:42.960
for employment yes i think so

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:45.440
especially imagine being 16 and be like

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.440
i deserve respect yeah if you don't

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.679
respect me i'll steal from your business

00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:51.039
i would steal to the point where i

00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:52.159
wanted the business to go out of

00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:54.480
business right i wanted to destroy them

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.000
not just be like a couple bucks i'm like

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.919
i'm going to destroy this place

00:25:57.919 --> 00:25:59.279
because

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:00.799
i don't even know why brewster's i just

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:02.559
didn't like being there i'm like this i

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:04.000
can't believe they're doing this to me

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
this job is boring

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.080
dude i was so whack when i was trying to

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.000
get revenge on jobs what'd you do i

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.840
would just stop doing my job at a high

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.440
level of quality

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.440
that's actually kind of right that's

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.720
kind of sick though i was working that

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.880

test to see if the burger was done they

00:29:34.159 --> 00:29:36.159

take all those burger slivers out of the

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.760

00:33:08.159 --> 00:33:10.000
one they take theirs and they just they

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.279
adjust it that's something i've noticed

00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:13.200
they go yeah or they'll like throw their

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.200
back against something and like give you

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.679
even though you're tempted away

00:33:17.679 --> 00:33:20.399
like you're like a bad dog or something

00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:22.240
i'm going for grandparent glory i just

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.000
so badly want my to be sitting with my

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.200
grandkids like did you do any of that

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.360
[ __ ] and be like [ __ ] though

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.600
absolutely so i was gay

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:32.880
i did i used to work with guys that

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.399
didn't believe in asbestos it was the

00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:36.559
best whoa yeah remember we had to shut

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:38.000
down a job and then one guy's like your

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.519
uncle's afraid of the [ __ ] because

00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:42.240
he's a [ __ ] i'd be like i think he's

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.279
right on that i think this is a good

00:33:43.279 --> 00:33:44.320
idea

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.840
stuff's the real deal those guys love

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.840
dying though you do get asbestos there's

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.440
i've met like a handful of asbestos

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.039
deniers that are like bro

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:51.919
you're going to get it you're going to

00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:54.080
get it this is like back in the 90s

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.919
they'd be like dude that's not what they

00:33:55.919 --> 00:33:58.240
were installing it in everything yeah so

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.480
we had it probably seemed unavoidable

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.120
true we had asbestos in uh candy

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.720
cigarettes candy cigarettes probably

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.159
were asbestos it's probably that's

00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:08.159
smoking them probably

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:10.720
we had a in our grade school the library

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.720
was just wall-to-wall i remember the one

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:13.679
day like you guys can't go to the

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.919
library it's all asbestos but

00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:17.599
asbestos is fine as long as you don't

00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:19.440
break it up as long as it's not like in

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.040
the air you could if this was these are

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.480
asbestos walls

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.560
fine it's just the install and the depth

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.320
and the demolition yeah so i have a i

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.919
have a basement floor that's covered

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:30.159
that's half covered in asbestos tile i'm

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:31.599
working on stuff in my house this is

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:33.359
where i'm probably going next dude i've

00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:35.040
taken i've chipped up asbestos no i'm

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.720
sweating i'm still rumbling every time i

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.480
walk through the basement it's friable

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.079
so now it's friable

00:34:40.079 --> 00:34:41.520
is it is that the water tribal means

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.280
yeah if it's if it's like able to become

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.520
airborne you have friable asbestos yeah

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.800
i noticed it like

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.399
on my foot the other day and i was like

00:34:48.399 --> 00:34:50.879
oh god i'm [ __ ] i'm just tracking this

00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:52.399
into like there's a connected garage in

00:34:52.399 --> 00:34:54.159
the basement i'm just tracking this into

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:56.079
a small room that i sit in every day to

00:34:56.079 --> 00:34:58.240

dude i've chipped up asbestos tile a

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.320
bunch of times before they got like

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.079
super like you need to hire like a

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:07.680
strictly asbestos dudes with the [ __ ]

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.680
like plastic bug mask

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.920

some a little bit at a time and put it

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:24.320
in the regular trash

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.839
i do i micro dose paint in my trash

00:35:27.839 --> 00:35:29.680
you can throw out latex paint now can

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.160
you yeah well this is strictly oil-based

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.760
this is the most harmful stuff yeah that

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.520
stuff's off that's they're not they're

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.839
not too keen on that stuff yeah yeah if

00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:39.680
you take contractor bags you can throw

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.520
in you can throw a car battery away in

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.960
the regular trash it doesn't matter oh

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.160
you can throw anything you can throw

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.720
someone's head away

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.960
yeah dude send just all you gotta do is

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.839
you gotta

00:35:49.839 --> 00:35:51.920
next time the kids go away you run a

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.440
tile chipper

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.440
you know you just [ __ ] and then you

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.119
take one you do it's a it's a rite of

00:35:57.119 --> 00:35:58.160
passage you hold your breath man of the

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.040
house yeah you just take the asbestos

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.640
yeah and if we said it's just part of

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.720
the floor i'll come do it i want to die

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.079
it's not that much i'll come do it with

00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:07.440
you i kind of want it spud got me to

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.160
stop using paint or tape when i paint i

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.599
think you just gotta not use a mask

00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:13.599
while i pull up asbestos you should wear

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:15.119
you should probably protect your face

00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:17.280
bro i wasn't [ __ ] on the construction

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.880
site me and matt aren't [ __ ] dude we

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.240
don't wear masks on the construction

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.079
site i was the biggest dust [ __ ] you

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:24.880
could imagine i hate dust dude

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.119
i hate it anytime dust kicked up i'd be

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:28.240
like uh

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.640
you could get a mess daddy be like yeah

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.720
dude my uncles would wear them with no

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.079
strap on the bottom

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:35.359
brutalize you over there one time i

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.880
asked for a pair of gloves to help pull

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.400
a tree stump out of the ground and my

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.839
uncle was like what are you gay

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.240
yeah dude we were yeah it's

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.520
we're in a place one time where it was

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.280
asbestos there's like there's not just

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.520
asbestos like tiles and floor they have

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.599
asbestos um

00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:55.440
like insulation on pipes too that's one

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.560
that gets you

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.160
it looks like a cast and you just hit it

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.040
it's just

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.880
turn you know the dust kicks up

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.560
but we there was like these windows with

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.960
like asbestos caulk and i remember it

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.720
was just like they were running machines

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.240
in the building we couldn't break the

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.680
windows out because they're asbestos

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.440
caulked so it's just like the the

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.520
building was just blue with diesel smoke

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.119
was this like the best material ever

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:16.320
invented

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.280
uh

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.040
yeah i think it was just like the number

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.720
one material ever i think it was like

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.960
hard as hell yeah so it's probably cheap

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.480
to make and it was i think some guy made

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.920
it and was like

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.119
yeah i definitely want to sell this

00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:28.880
stuff whoa didn't they take an

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.640
ingredient out of four loko

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.160
i'm gonna start it's probably it's

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.880
probably asbestos

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:36.960
that's what gets you [ __ ] up

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.400
i think asbestos like i would start

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.240
using it if it was so good dude like

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.520
dude the government can't tell me i'm

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.359
not allowed to use asbestos true

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:45.040
they're all the sickest materials

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.200
available i think look up the properties

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.800
of asbestos is it good i think

00:37:55.359 --> 00:37:57.440
[ __ ] [ __ ] imagine if you're like

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.640
they're like all your tinfoil gives you

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.800
cancer you're like bro tin foils of [ __ ]

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.680
yes

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.520
tinfoil is crazy never giving up tin

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.760
foil tinfoil is the fifth element dude i

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.040
was thinking about that the other day

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.000
like how

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.839
how disrespectful it is that we just

00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:12.400
tossed out tin foil it should be reusing

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.560
it until it falls apart that's not a bad

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.400
idea no after you use tin foil you're

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.839
supposed to make a really cool ball out

00:38:17.839 --> 00:38:19.040
of it and just throw it around for a

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.400
little bit that's true every single

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.680
piece of tinfoil you ever use that's

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.880
still a re-use

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.880
yeah like totally true yeah yeah just

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.040
collect it actually oh yeah and then you

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.400
just rub it around on a table for a

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.760
really long time until the table starts

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.680
to have like metal shavings on it you're

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.200
like oh you're looking at the smooth

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.960
edge of the tin foil you know what the

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.880
[ __ ] i'm talking about oh man you're

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.400
like oh dude i've perfectly mirror

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.400
polished this edge of the tin foil ball

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.760
that's that's how you might be a

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.040
different this might be a different

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.720
mineral now

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.760
i've

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.480
is this quartz noun

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.880
what you got

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.040
uh asbestos is naturally occurring

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.640
nobody made it it's just like a

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.880
naturally occurring silicate mineral

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.720
you're a [ __ ] chill dude there's six

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.200
different kinds really yeah it's a

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.880
silicon it's not even a drug dude it's

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.240
like it's a lawn it goes in the air bro

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.240
it could be drugs it's a it's a long

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.400
thin fibrous crystal that's how it grows

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.920
what and they just i guess they just

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.800
like compact it to make like like tiles

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.640
so you tell me it's an earth it's an

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.440
earth

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.839
asbestos is it in earth welcome to earth

00:39:19.839 --> 00:39:20.960
what

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.800
and then someone was like were they did

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.240
they give up on it

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.520
they could have fixed it i'm sure the

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.520
particles are like the silicate gets in

the torso just like eating out a [ __ ]

00:55:23.599 --> 00:55:26.480
torso i would

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.799
sounds amazing

00:55:28.799 --> 00:55:30.480
just randomly throwing your mouth around

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:33.119
no target

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.720
just like fingering that like elbow

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.799
finger in it

00:55:38.799 --> 00:55:40.319

00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:41.040
yeah

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.000
if i could do it all again

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.559
i'd go like four i think that's what a

00:55:46.559 --> 00:55:48.480
hawkeye is it's like it represents like

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.960
going down on fat chicks oh what like

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.079
like in new zealand when they're doing a

00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:54.000
haka what's a haka you know when they're

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.440
like

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.760
you know

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.640
yeah

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.319
and then

00:56:02.319 --> 00:56:03.920
rugby teams dance at each other that's

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.599
what hawke is you know those you've seen

00:56:05.599 --> 00:56:07.119
viral i know now i know what it is i

00:56:07.119 --> 00:56:09.040
mostly know that like when like some guy

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.040
dies his football team comes and does a

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.160
hawkeye at his funeral that makes sense

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.799
to eat out his wife yeah i mean

00:56:14.799 --> 00:56:16.799
to be fair to be fair i think there's a

00:56:16.799 --> 00:56:18.240
biological thing if you went to like a

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.079
country that was just like

00:56:20.079 --> 00:56:21.839
you know not doing that well they just

00:56:21.839 --> 00:56:22.880
the point where they don't have

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.400
beautiful fat women

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.799
and you drop them like a

00:56:26.799 --> 00:56:30.240
like four hunch the men would be like

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.839
i'm i'm getting it

00:56:31.839 --> 00:56:33.200
yeah it would be beautiful to you if you

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.640
were in a place where like i'm above you

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:38.400
to look like ants carrying a grape away

00:56:38.559 --> 00:56:41.680
like from height from the planet

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:48.320
[Laughter]

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.799

00:57:01.839 --> 00:57:03.440
i'm down that that would be a sick

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.760
reality tv show

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.359
but today we found a country where

00:57:07.359 --> 00:57:09.200
there's no fat ladies and we're drunk

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.240

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:21.360
[Laughter]

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.079
documentary people with different

00:57:24.079 --> 00:57:25.599
lifestyles than us and like they pull in

00:57:25.599 --> 00:57:27.520
a giant fish in the whole town just like

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:30.079

00:57:45.359 --> 00:57:47.359
neighboring tribes

00:57:47.359 --> 00:57:48.640

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.720
leader would get assassinated and like

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:51.599
that

00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:55.559

yeah sure no yeah

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.640

celebration though

00:59:06.319 --> 00:59:07.599
yeah you know

00:59:07.599 --> 00:59:09.200

like if you brought up

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:14.880
a celebration

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.920
just a bunch of dudes in like very thick

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.359

different different fat [ __ ]

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.559
celebrations around the world the

00:59:28.559 --> 00:59:30.559
government would intervene dude

00:59:30.559 --> 00:59:32.480
the government would be like we're

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:35.119
getting her out of here

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.240
that was the funniest i mean it's

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.839
actually it's a horrible human tragedy

00:59:41.839 --> 00:59:43.599
but that one book i read about i think

00:59:43.599 --> 00:59:45.760
it was darfur like the government the

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:47.280
government i don't know why people they

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.480
think the government says people made

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.319
this up but they would like come down in

00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:51.839
like blackhawks and just like shoot

00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:53.760
villages from the sky and then like

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:54.960
everyone's like well [ __ ] this we'll go

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:57.200
to kenya then the government's like

00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.880
we didn't [ __ ] shoot them they're

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.559
just walking dude

01:00:00.559 --> 01:00:02.160
they're just leaving and walking just

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.319
because they're being [ __ ]

01:00:04.319 --> 01:00:06.000
like they were coming down and attacking

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.480
and i think i think it was it was sudan

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.240
the government was sending like arabian

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.599
dudes yo

01:00:11.599 --> 01:00:13.119
go take those lands because we don't

01:00:13.119 --> 01:00:14.160
really [ __ ] with those guys because they

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.760
want independence like arabian dudes who

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.680
come and just like chop you up on horses

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.040
then the government was sending like

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.200
[ __ ] helicopters attack you and they

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.960
like they walked all these dudes walked

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.160

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.000
that's that's classic government though

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.400
true remember remember when i was like

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.000
migrants were coming like the caravan

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.960
was walking up north yeah i guess like

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.040
the government mistreating these [ __ ]

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.400
emigrants and they'd be like nah dude

01:00:48.079 --> 01:00:49.839
whooping dude when they get back here

01:00:49.839 --> 01:00:52.160

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.720
we didn't do that to them like they like

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.720

01:01:00.559 --> 01:01:01.760
hovered over them and threatened them

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.119
that we'd have arabian guys cut their

01:01:03.119 --> 01:01:04.640
heads off

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.559

gof or something something like that's

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.040

and with black markers like no one can

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.680
