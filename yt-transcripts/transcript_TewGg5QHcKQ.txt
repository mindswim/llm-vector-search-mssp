00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.480
uh i remember joey scazzola used to say

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.359
if you saw a disembodied vagina he's an

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.880
open micro guy

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.200
but one of his jokes i remember if you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.320
saw a disembodied vagina on the street

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.640
as a kid you'd pick it up with a stick

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.520
and chase your friends with it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.879
he turned out to be

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.440
not only gay but uh uh

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.800
mentally ill

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.559
violently

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.040

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.159
yeah

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.759
but yeah transvaginal measurings i

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.280

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.759
really long vagina no one's ever said

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.280

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.040
transvaginal mesh transfer

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.560
the commercial could come on i remember

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.320
it was always during flyers games for

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.520
some reason

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.360
i'd be watching the game

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.600
and then there'd be a transvaginal mesh

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.200
commercial

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.399
and i didn't know what it was i never

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.680
know what i

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.399
i thought it was to catch [ __ ]

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.000
i thought it was a [ __ ] like birth

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.920
control they just put like i forget

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.600
you're only 15 years old you just put

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.320
like a net in your [ __ ] like a backstop

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.800
yeah i thought it was now that's what

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.080
that's what you thought the other

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.599
[ __ ] diet what a diaphragm was

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.599
basically no a diaphragm isn't it like a

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.760
rubber [ __ ] it's a cap it's a it kind

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.720
of

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.400
covers the cervix it's the opening of

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.920
the surface

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.560
like a [ __ ] unrolled condom

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.400
yeah i know

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.040
thank you ew

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.000
cervix but it was it was it was whatever

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.200
the [ __ ] chemical tasting [ __ ]

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.519
lubricant that they used in 1981 when i

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.840
was minoxidil nine when i was being

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.920
raped oh it's a spermicide

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.040
she was 19 and i was 16. so i i think

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.040
that's rape oh yeah

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.959
we're all victims if we want to

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.920
how does law transcend

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.360
it's too bad the double standard doesn't

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.120
apply to women when it comes to like

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.720
getting raped

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.239
like you know when like a guy gets raped

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.239
by like a teacher

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.959
everyone's like nice kids

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.480
but nobody ever says that to a female

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.480
victim they're never like oh god got you

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.239
in the parking garage

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.120
this is an example of a hot premise that

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.720
is a very legitimate premise yeah

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.120
yeah very hack premise

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.680
and it's demeaning to women where you go

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.159
oh of a a 15 year old girl isn't as

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.519
smart as a 15 year old boy

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.879
to say oh a 15 year old boy [ __ ] a 25

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.400
year old teacher he's cool so what

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.360
you're saying is a [ __ ] woman at 15

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.319
is not as smart as a 15 year old boy

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.120
yeah he can take it she can't

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.319
and that's

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.239
i mean i think i think sexism i think

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.920
the true answer is the people who make

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.400
the laws are men

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.400
so when they hear a story of like a a

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.920
student [ __ ] a hot teacher they're

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.640
like

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.720
there's no way that's a crime i wish

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.519
that was i wish i could see that

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.959
uh and when it's a lady a female student

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.600
they're like we need to protect

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.919
that's my daughter

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.079
that's all it is because either way it

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.759
[ __ ] rocks

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.320
i support both rapes

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.960
it almost

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.840
pardoned me

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.479
i'm not that was chilly's editless

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.759
i'm not defending

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.720
i'm not defending the females uh i'm not

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.880
like oh no boys are just as bad i'm like

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.960
both rule no no

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.120
what what happens is

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.720
we treat adults like children for too

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.759
long

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:52.720
when

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.960
nature says you can have a baby at 12 or

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.320
13.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.720
that's nature so what you're trying to

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.400
do is legislate against nature

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.440
by keeping your children stupid if you

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.639
go hey just don't [ __ ] me this is a good

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.240
thing but you don't tell them that till

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.720
they're [ __ ] 18. it's awkward imagine

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.280
two 12 year olds having a kid

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.759
yeah it happens it's i know it's most of

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.600
the world that's a problem that's a

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.919
problem that's a problem it's a problem

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.240
here because we don't [ __ ] no because

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.840
we realize that would be catastrophic

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.320
for society so we were like that's

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.039
immoral but it's actually just

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.919
bad for everybody yeah and but you don't

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.919
teach kids that you have a weird awkward

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.479

television on

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.120
at the fun house because i'm sitting

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.880
thing we shared yeah and we watched

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.680
movies but i'm behind the bar so i

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.519
you're laughing at something behind me i

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.360
have to crane my neck

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.160
i would yell at kenny and derek for no

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.120
don't put [ __ ] tv on here it's sports

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.480
or music

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.920
that's that's it

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.760
like hockey's on

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.360
so you have something to look at when

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.440
you're bored with derek's conversation

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.600
i have noticed that the second we put tv

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.120
on at night you you go you go to bed

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.760
that's where i watch tv in bed

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.959
not here

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:34.480
in my neck while we're having a

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.959
conversation you should be surrounded by

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:38.800
five flat screens

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.720
and turning your back to them

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.440
well

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.560
as you sit on this side as as you will

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.080

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.160
bar was built

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.160
for football because this used to be

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.720
just the football room so this is all

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.080
for people to watch tv it's not a good

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.480
we should have a horseshoe shape for

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.120
socializing but we didn't socialize we

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.360
watched football and then i

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.160
didn't talk to people

the show's good

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.760
like the office relationship i hate it

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.079

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:49.839

in the warehouse is like fiance yeah

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.920

dude up in the [ __ ] office i don't

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.480

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.800
that's every dude's nightmare

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.160
some lady that's like my office husband

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.760

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.800
hey this is

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.279
men are allowed to cheat women aren't

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:20.240
that's just how it is

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.639
this is something that did not come up

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:25.360
earlier officer bob friendly came over

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.760
to apologize to you

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.760
because he heard the podcast that made

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.240
me you had a spirited conversation he

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.839
left

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.760
i came over here with that a lot i like

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.320
him yeah i came in and yeah we said yeah

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.320
it made me a little uncomfortable

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.000
he's like i i didn't

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.480
like a lot of times we

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.120
ramp [ __ ] up for the podcast like all

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.920
right nothing happened yesterday

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.240
but that's that's something so we ramp

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.320
it up and that's a little i thought i

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.240
thought it was a

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.480
heated debate it wasn't like it

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.160
necessarily a fight but it was

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.959
definitely like a it's fueled by alcohol

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:05.199
yeah it was like alcohol

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:08.720
pro uh conspiracy theories conspiracy

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.639
that's the whole point it's not even

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:12.560
close to a conspiracy

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.480
i think it's common knowledge that's

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.320
what i said to him today he didn't kill

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.000
himself everybody in the whole this was

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
all i was saying was the whole country

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.560
knows he didn't and we're all just like

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.560
all right

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.639
that's what i said to him today i said

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:29.839
uh it's got a lot more legs than flat

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:32.079
earth so that's that was one of my

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:33.759
points i was like i'm not like telling

00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:34.639
you

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:36.399
the earth is flat i'm not even arguing

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.399
jfk or the [ __ ] moon landing i don't

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:40.959
[ __ ] with any of that this one

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.639
this one seems pretty

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:45.440
cut and dry the cameras broke

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.120
and the security guards missed it

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.800
so why did you why did you leave the

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.759
room

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:54.320
when he came in today oh just cause uh

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.160
he was sober and it was awkward we were

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.680
both me and

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.720
officer friendly were sober

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.079
so it was like i didn't want to have a

00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:04.240
real like genuinely concerned i know he

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.639
was worried that i was no i was i was

own

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.600

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.400
funny how he was [ __ ] with me in the

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.760
argument being like well i know you're

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.199
worried about you know your buddy

investigate it because you care about

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
him i was like no that's not why you

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.959
[ __ ] i

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.120
yeah he was drunk talking [ __ ] it was

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.439
funny

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.839
the real conversation happened after he

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:27.439
left

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:29.919
and i explained to tracy why liberals

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:32.559
are racist

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:34.000
for three hours

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
racist i didn't say you were an old

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.919
white you definitely call me racist a

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:40.160
couple of times no i said that is a

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.080
racist way of thinking a couple times

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.520
while i was hammered

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.120
look i'm here right now so i'll defend

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.960
it again

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.880
and apologizing again tomorrow i'll be

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.559
like [ __ ] i wish i didn't say that on

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:53.520
the goddamn podcast it was fun

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.039
no it was uh

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:56.480
like i just think white people need to

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.160
be educated about black people and i was

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.360
like

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.720
do you think black people need to be

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.400
educated like you wouldn't make that

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.600
statement you wouldn't be like black

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.760
people need to learn about white people

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.440
it's like so that's a weird terrible

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.760
there's something weird there

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.320
i understand it sounds like a double uh

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.120
it's a smarter double standard

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.960
anyway i was hammering it's different

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.240
than when people say well why can't can

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.799
they say the n word but they could say

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:25.840
this but no

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.440
you're absolutely correct yeah it was

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.280
just funny to and then the whole time i

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.640
was like oh yeah there's cameras

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.760
everywhere

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.760
this conversation if this conversation

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.600
is recorded this is gonna be one of the

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.840
more embarrassing debates of all time

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.080
the in the scheme of things no probably

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.679
not i don't i don't think

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:45.919
security footage from the fun host will

00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:47.520
ever get into the

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.480
public record

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.280
we're talking about uh

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.120
now

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.760

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.520
lot

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.440
there's been comics i've heard

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.200
that we were talking about that earlier

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.960
because i was i saw doug special i was

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.880

yeah i see why netflix was like nah nah

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.960
uh very cancelable special which is a

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.919
good

00:19:27.919 --> 00:19:30.160
kind of a good thing to be as a comic i

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.640
think uh i've uh

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.520
again no names but i've i know comics to

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.440
put uh this is uh too dirty for [ __ ]

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.640
everything

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.280
you know that's it's just not it's jokes

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.799
yeah

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:46.640
it's just jokes yeah it's not a story

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.080
everybody that's listening knows you

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.200
don't like you're not a part of it

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.280
yeah so they i was talking about this

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.039
one time at comic

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:56.000
uh

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.240
he was talking [ __ ] on me and then his

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.679
whoever was doing the podcast with him

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:00.880
was like how come you haven't been

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.480
canceled and he's like i'm not

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.559
cancelable it's like well because you're

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:06.400
not saying anything you're literally

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.559
saying nothing there's no risk you've

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:10.240
never taken a risk i've never heard one

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.120
risk from that comic yeah but anyway

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.039
because they're jokes

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:17.120
it's not taking a standpoint

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.159
yeah

00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:21.600

if you gave him

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:35.039
an ounce of credit to know what he's

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:37.200

knowing no one's sure

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.000
if he is actually good at manipulating

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.200
to force journalists to be like were you

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.279

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:29.760

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.319
i i worry about that yeah but there's no

00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:02.880
uh there's no shelving

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.359
for a shampoo or something so what i do

00:48:05.359 --> 00:48:07.440
is i put shampoo in my hand put it on

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.839
top of my dry head

00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:13.040
while i'm brushing my teeth

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.280
shower i do brush my teeth in the shower

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.640
it's a good move

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.160
a lot of people

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.400
i had a college roommate that's exactly

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.760
right

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.920
yeah that's what maybe shampoo on your

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.920

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.920
know you'd be alright

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.440
there is a little suction cup thing in

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.760
there that my ear may not work i tried

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.200
it today

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.319
uh the grooves in the actual shower like

00:48:36.319 --> 00:48:39.440
the tile the ground prevent one of the

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.200
sections yes i figured that's why it

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.960

leave a good message

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.440
hey todd glass i just used using

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.040
as an example of people who aren't

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.040
really going to be my friends like shane

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.960
gillis who's probably going to leave my

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.000
house

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.040
and i'm all alone and i'm drunk and we

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.480
do podcasts but no one listens we're

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.880
[ __ ] speaking into the ether isn't

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.880
that yeah yeah yeah

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.119
tracy just verified that's an actual

00:51:23.119 --> 00:51:24.400
expression

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.200
so yeah uh shane gillis

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.440
came out he was gonna be my friend i

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.839
have no friends and i thought you and i

00:51:31.839 --> 00:51:34.240
were gonna be close and i think it's

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.599
trailing off

00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:38.720
but hopefully the pandemic is trailing

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.520
off and friendship isn't calling him all

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.200
right i'll stop calling you

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.079
trail

00:51:44.079 --> 00:51:47.680
tracy says stop calling it

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.400
all right that that i think that went

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.079
well that was a bad one

00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:54.559
that was a very bad voicemail

00:51:54.559 --> 00:51:55.200
i

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:59.240
should i call back

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.000
i'm starting to figure out slightly

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:08.880
ah

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.160
yeah go starting to figure out dogs

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.760
insecurities

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.440
that i can

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.680
exploit

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.000
and i'm pretty excited about it

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
they're pretty easy yeah you make them

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.680
very clear but now that we're

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:26.480
comfortable enough as as as friends

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.920
you know when i first show up i'm not

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.200
gonna be a [ __ ] immediately that

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.720
would be insane

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.079
but now i'm getting like today when i

00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:33.599
was like i i

00:52:33.599 --> 00:52:36.800
watched the special finally

00:52:37.119 --> 00:52:39.359
yeah i enjoyed that

00:52:39.359 --> 00:52:40.720
what was funny though is i closed the

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.520
door

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.359
it went back in and i was like

00:52:43.359 --> 00:52:46.720
i hope that didn't [ __ ] with them

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.920
because if i put a special out and

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.880
somebody was no i i was really special

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.119
i enjoyed that because

00:52:53.119 --> 00:52:55.520
because you have been somewhat timid and

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.760
i had to explain that to officer bob

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.119

00:53:01.119 --> 00:53:04.079

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.480
be itching to get back out there and

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:57.040

and i i want to get it out of my act so

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:44.480
i think i might film this right here

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.799
