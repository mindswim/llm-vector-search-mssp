oh yes yeah i know i thought you're

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.080
picturing her no

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.480
um and then 30 year old mexican activist

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.600
yeah and then dorian vasquez and how did

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.679
he did it

00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:02.480
he was he did fine he's hilarious yeah

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.760
but uh then

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.159
then uh so in the green room before the

00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:10.320
show we're just sitting there talking

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.520
and

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.440
the mexican lady

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.440
was [ __ ] on

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.320
pennsylvania's treatment of immigrants

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.799
illegal immigrants okay that

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:21.840
come to

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.000
when they get to america ice puts them

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.320
basically in like

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.679
facilities

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:30.159
so it's like they're not in jail but if

00:26:30.159 --> 00:26:32.080
they leave they'll get arrested

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.440
because they're illegal immigrants yeah

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.799
yeah and

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:37.360
i was like i used to work for dhs the

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.600
department in pennsylvania and she was

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.039
like oh so you know all about it like

00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:44.320
she [ __ ] hated why she dhs workers uh

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.159
because the conditions she hates she's

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:49.200
like it's what's dhs have to do with ice

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.360
so

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.840
there's like county prisons basically or

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.679
like county they're not

00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:57.039
technically prisons do they split the

00:26:57.039 --> 00:26:58.480
family up from age group or they let

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.840
them all chill well so then dhs

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.840
looks at these facilities and gives a

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.840
to the facilities if they're up to par

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.559
because any child facility in the state

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:13.120
dhs operates yeah

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.240
but then ice and federal funding also so

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.880
sick acronym tail ice yeah yeah

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.120
that's the last acronym i went after me

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.080
nice

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.600
but uh

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.480
she just hated dhs is involved they're

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.720
issuing the contracts these places

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.640
these facilities like berks county berks

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.720
county is the one did you ever go see

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.919
some of the conditions they might be in

00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:35.440
like you're a dhs worker your job yeah i

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.159
did

00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:38.320
my job was to go to condition or to go

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.080
check conditions make sure they're okay

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.760
make sure they have like appropriate you

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.520
know like yeah fire alarms there's no

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.679
space heaters there's [ __ ] no bed

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:47.520
bugs

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.279
like they should just totally be like no

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:51.840
well then she finally admitted well

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.000
she's anti-borders

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.080
globally she doesn't believe in nations

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.720
borders she believes it's a human

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.159
right to migrate

00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:03.360
seamlessly

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.679
okay which so i mean that kind of i was

00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:07.760
i was on that when i was 21 yeah i used

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.039
to do a ton of mushrooms and i thought i

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:10.720
lived in an undisturbed ecosystem in my

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.000
house yeah that's a [ __ ] sick idea

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.600
yeah it doesn't really work that way but

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.440
uh so then i was like yeah my sister was

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.480
the com director for dhs like my sister

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.720
was like high up in that whole thing so

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.080
i started texting my sister and i was

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.919
like well give me something to respond

00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:27.600
to this because this ladies yeah there's

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.200
got to be a reason that

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.880
it can't be evil

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.880
like they can't be locking up immigrants

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.360
and being like treating them horribly

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.399
and like

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:37.679
it's like these are illegal immigrants

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:39.679
that they're waiting for asylum and

00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:41.120
they're giving they're giving them like

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.520
a bed and oh okay yeah yeah yeah they're

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.640
waiting for us

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.399
it's like what uh ayan hershey ali had

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:48.880
to live in so wow so it's

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.240
it was supposed to be a children's

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.840
facility but then they just started

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.159
letting random [ __ ] adults live in

00:28:54.159 --> 00:28:56.480
the same facility as these kids so then

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.679
dhs

00:28:57.679 --> 00:28:59.760
got rid they did not extend the contract

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.120
with them okay they're like you're

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.640
failing you can't have [ __ ] random

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.000
people in there anyway

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.440
so there's a long thing about that but

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.960
this lady starts talking about like

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.520
colonizers and white devils in the green

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.480
room

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.640
i'm just sitting there like oh whoa whoa

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.520
whoa

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.279
dude i mean she might have been joking

00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:17.840
but still that's even joking it's like

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.000
you're you're basically a human rights

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.760
activist but you're gonna sit here and

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.720
use racial slurs yeah

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.559
and it's like i mean i'm not offended

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:29.200
don't worry yeah exactly but

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.960
why don't you i mean that's the lamest

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.520
slur too it's like well your ancestors

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.679
400 years ago dominated territories

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:38.480
through military combat and it's like

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.240
okay she's like what conditions brought

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.159
these immigrants to america it's like

00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:44.240
america destroying the entire hemisphere

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.840

00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:04.320
colonizing

like we never oppressed anybody else and

00:31:06.399 --> 00:31:08.480
it's like yeah you [ __ ] did yeah

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.080
fully definitely

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.840
he didn't become a huge superpower like

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.760
that that's dude i mean anyway but it

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.360

process yeah i'm just so glad my my

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.000
culture never

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.399
you know oppressed anyone else

00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:23.679
yeah if that's uh that's what you're

00:31:23.679 --> 00:31:24.720
into

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.279
like using [ __ ] irish exactly that's

00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:29.039
the thing no one wants to hear about

00:31:29.039 --> 00:31:30.720
and i was like we didn't really set the

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.520
world on fire either yeah i'm sure i'm

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.039

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:36.080
irish people have done throughout

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.679
history but yeah but i mean i don't

00:31:37.679 --> 00:31:39.519

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.519
stand up yeah

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:43.360
but uh it's all cultural man cause they

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.640
tell i mean they do a lot of cultures

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.080
but even irish it's like you don't like

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.360
if i ever complained when i was little

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.880
my mom would offer it up to jesus and

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.240
i'm like [ __ ]

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.679
god damn it it's not like yeah sit

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:53.600
around and [ __ ] cry no i sit around

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.399
and cry um

00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:02.399
we ought to submit articles and [ __ ] and

00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:03.519
in the article

00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:05.279
one article one of the stats in it that

00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:07.200
was pretty interesting was uh the

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.880
average irish man in 1858

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.480
14 pounds of potatoes a day

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.039
what yeah i think i think let me i gotta

00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:18.799
double check that eight fourteen pounds

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:20.480
yeah because they were just absolutely

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.159
like 11. so they're just they're

00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:23.519
adjusting anything they could eat was

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:25.360
potatoes basically holy [ __ ] because all

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.000
the food the english coffee awesome

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.200
yeah i heard about that they took all

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.640
their [ __ ] so what was the deal with

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.840
that what was the potato famine the

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.200
english just went was it one of those

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.399
things where they made them farm then

00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:36.159
took all their food yeah they would i

00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:38.640
mean ireland still had [ __ ] livestock

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.640
and grain and other

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.480
forms of food but

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.120
the english would collect all that it's

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.799
like you owe us that that's ours they

00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:49.039
would take it and store it

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:51.120
like a samurai system with the rice so

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.120
then when the blight happened and all

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.880
the potato crops failed that was all the

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.360
food they had so millions of people died

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.279
because of these food practices yeah

00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:01.600
[ __ ] because of our oppression bro

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.960
didn't you know how impressed we were

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.600
now i do [ __ ] piss they even used the

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.399
same

00:34:06.399 --> 00:34:09.040
ships the slave ships to bring irish to

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.960
america did they really

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.560
former slave ships

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.560
i heard on the slave ships it was like

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.679
it was fun

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:18.240
no it was it was not fun but i heard the

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.919
uh and again maybe this is wrong but i

00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:21.200
heard that

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.440
it was like equal europeans to africans

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.879
dying on the way over like dudes and

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:26.800
those crews were getting statistically

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.399
yeah but there were a lot more africans

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.240
on the boat

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.359
okay significant number more african

00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:34.720
ships gotcha maybe it was

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.079
percentage-wise they weren't rolling

00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:37.040
that deep

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.960
no i mean dude they were packing people

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.960
in like like me and bees are in the

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.320
hotel room that's true they're getting

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.599
that's true dude think of the snore

00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:45.280
damage on those ships that's why when

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.480
people are like

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.079
you know again this is this is just from

00:34:48.079 --> 00:34:50.560
my research but when they say that like

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.000
white people like went into like the

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.159
interiors of africa and like we're

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.599
stealing something i know where this is

00:34:55.599 --> 00:34:57.440
going it was the invention of quinine

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.800
dude they people they couldn't do that

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.400
until quinine happened until people got

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.640
quinine so it was like they're saying

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.720
basically like well you know

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.320
there's networks dude set up that would

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.520
meet people on the shores and sell

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.040
people it wasn't like christopher

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.320
columbus hacking his way through the

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.320
african wilderness yeah be like oh let's

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.560
get him come on so was it

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.160
it was it was just african south

africans dude what's the europeans what

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.760
did you just say i mean it's

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.960

true you got your force field up

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.920
um but he said like before the invention

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.119
of quinine guys couldn't even really

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:32.079
even get off the boats over there

00:35:32.079 --> 00:35:34.800

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.160
next day dude i'm in the nearby hecks a

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.800

try to get my hands on scopolamine

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.839

00:39:07.839 --> 00:39:10.160
volamine is this stuff that like grows i

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.599
think in the jungle in cuba or somewhere

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:12.960
in south america

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.720

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.119
this plant flowering plant you pull the

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:18.640
seeds off and grind them up and if i'm

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.920
getting this wrong it's something like

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.079
this from the plant you grind it up into

00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:23.839
a powder so i could just walk up to you

00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:25.599

the [ __ ] on my hand like that and blow

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.480
it if you breathe in a little bit of it

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.040
you become a walking like zombie

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.400
so like but if i give you too much you

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.200
die

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.640

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.680
be like all right chan let's go back to

absolute dark arts that's that's scary

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.480
so i was watching a documentary on it

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.560
and then this guy ended up killing this

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.240
prostitute killed

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.480
this colombian dude's brother and then

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.320

she's no longer with us he like

00:40:19.839 --> 00:40:21.440
basically says like i [ __ ] killed her

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.480
yeah well here's here's this is not

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.560
this is semi-related but it's like we we

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.760
get all these

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.040
documentaries

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.839
of just freak random things

00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:34.160
and now we're like that's a concern

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.440
you know what i mean so coppola means

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.880
not a concern here at all no of course

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.560
not but i'm saying in general like oh

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.359
yeah

00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:41.040
all these random [ __ ] documentaries

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.400

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.040
like one dude in brazil did some weird

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.240
[ __ ] well apparently it's just like a uh

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.680
it's just like another scam that they

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.119

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:56.400
that kind of plant kicking around yeah

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.160
i'm not competing then when you like

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.520
but then you have like the ancient like

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.040
shamanises too and they're grant like

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.319
imagine if your great grandmother was a

00:41:02.319 --> 00:41:04.000

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.000
their servants

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.680
it's the same drug they blow scapulae in

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.359
your face and they bury you so you're

00:41:15.359 --> 00:41:16.800
just like laying there

dude i was sitting here today

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.160

00:42:31.839 --> 00:42:32.960
i was driving to get something to eat

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.160
with my babe and she was listening to

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.599
rap and i was like

00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:37.599
it's such a weird [ __ ] life

00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:39.680
but just being [ __ ] yeah just like

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.599
being that hype on yourself all day

00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:43.359
every day that's tough

00:42:43.359 --> 00:42:44.960
like imagine having like it sucks being

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.079
like kind of depressed and having to do

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:47.359
a stand-up imagine if you like kind of

00:42:47.359 --> 00:42:48.560

[ __ ] loser [ __ ] kill myself pusha

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.839
t was so mean

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.280
i don't have a kid he lied

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.960
i was dude i was thinking how sick of a

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.040
response it would be if he used clips of

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.800
donald trump in his beat

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.319
like fake news

00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:13.040
he called pusha

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.119
i mean that was like

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:27.040
that was it called the the story of

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.240
adidon whatever yeah it sounds adonis

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.560
but it adidon was the name of his adidas

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.160
yeah and apparently he's gonna be his

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.400
brand they said he was planning to roll

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.560
out his son with a shoe like oh by the

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.240
way i have a son nsu

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.240
here's what i started thinking dude

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.560
i mean again i connect the dots like

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.920
it's my curse but

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.839
kanye has a deal with adidas and he

00:43:49.839 --> 00:43:51.280
heard drake's coming out with an adidas

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.920
shoe i think kanye you know good music

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.680
now you know pusha t is attacking and

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.920
then dude that other [ __ ] came back real

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.800
quick

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.160
what's what other [ __ ] that response

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.000
like they had that couch yeah so i think

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.760
kanye launched like a

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.599
a psy ops against drake to take his [ __ ]

00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:07.760
to [ __ ] the shoe up maybe

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.440
i'm not saying dude i mean that's good

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.760
music dude kanye's at the head of that

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.680
and you tell pusha t like hey man i know

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.119
you haven't had an album in a while i'll

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.480
[ __ ] write you some [ __ ] do you see

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.400
seven songs start [ __ ] with drake drugs

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.000
and then tell this is some [ __ ] i found

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.680
out about him let people know

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.240
so he knocked over kanye's mastermind i

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.160
think so dude which would all that lead

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.000
all the way to trump

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.200
i mean don't get me started i think

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.000
trump don't get me started on the

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.280
kardash and trump and how i think

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.560
they're going to start running i think

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.640
trump kim's got a lot of press recently

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.119
with uh prison reform she's killing it

00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:41.359
so you think kardashian trump is coming

00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:44.079
up yeah well i think a ticket i think

00:44:44.079 --> 00:44:45.839
there's i it's either trump's paying

00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:47.359
them to normalize him just dude just

00:44:47.359 --> 00:44:49.040
like hillary reached out to jay-z you

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.280
know and uh jay-z and beyonce they

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.400

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.319
billion dollars

00:45:56.319 --> 00:45:57.760

about that dude that's what i mean i'm

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.280
saying i think it's coming from the

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.520
executive office that's like here's some

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.839
[ __ ] news i i uncovered trump might

have wrote that rebuttal for pushing i

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.880
think trump did write that i think he

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.960
wrote that dude he's a good lyricist

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.040
yeah dude he's like i'm gonna

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.160
chop the top season dude

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.839
oh man

00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:26.640
where are we at 25 45. oh baby 45 man

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.640
zoo we're sliding into home this is that

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.400
was my conspiracy of the week dude it's

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.079
a good conspiracy yeah

00:46:32.079 --> 00:46:33.599
his new albums take though i do like it

00:46:33.599 --> 00:46:35.200
yeah kanye's album is good but now it's

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.599
so funny i feel like such a boob

00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:38.720
because i was like conor's such a

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.160
[ __ ] idiot he's not even that good

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.520
and as soon

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.599
as he like mirrored my political views

00:46:43.599 --> 00:46:46.160
i'm like he's actually really good i was

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.240
i didn't give him credit

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.920
so that's funny i'm just the opposite

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.079
yes people who are like he's a genius

00:46:52.079 --> 00:46:53.200
but i'm listening to i'm like god this

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.440
guy is [ __ ] good well now it's now

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.720
you also never listen to one of his

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.160
albums i would judge it like he's all

00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.599
right

00:46:59.599 --> 00:47:00.560
i've listened to all his outfits i just

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.839
started his radio hits and i'm like he's

00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:04.720
all right i like kanye but

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.000
when people would call him a [ __ ]

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.240
lyrical it was his lyrics i always hated

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.160
yeah lyrically sucks like they got

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.680
better these ones have been pretty funny

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.200
the [ __ ] he's been saying that's funny

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.359
but they still suck yeah

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:17.280
for the most part yeah i know

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.280
i i could see that i get real into some

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.800
of the [ __ ]

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.119
now i do i only listen to saint pablo on

00:47:23.119 --> 00:47:25.839

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.520
yes dude

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.040
listening to kanye west wearing a blue

uh

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.559
year one of hogwarts was a pretty white

00:58:02.559 --> 00:58:04.640
school again yeah it gets kind of like

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.240

you're like man these guys aren't even

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.960
following any breadcrumbs

breadcrumbs are all around us dude and

00:59:34.319 --> 00:59:36.079
all these [ __ ] hipsters don't follow

00:59:36.079 --> 00:59:37.520
oh this place is a target dude i gotta

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.760

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.760
i don't know bombs and [ __ ] yeah i mean

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.599
that that actually is like a worrisome

00:59:43.599 --> 00:59:45.680
thing yeah i'm like damn now my chances

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:46.640
like how you live in california it's

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:47.760
like well watch out for the earthquakes

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.359
it's like you gotta watch out for much

00:59:49.359 --> 00:59:51.359
in new york but the big one except

00:59:51.359 --> 00:59:53.119
except the boys someone nukes the united

00:59:53.119 --> 00:59:57.920
states or for sure well yeah if russian

00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.319
it's hit in new york do you think with

01:00:00.319 --> 01:00:02.079
the other bomb delaware

01:00:02.079 --> 01:00:06.240
i gotta bomb new york city what about dc

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.799
ah that wouldn't be a bad idea

01:00:08.799 --> 01:00:10.640
well what if they hit the

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.319
west coast

01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:14.880
that would be more like an asian nuke

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.559
well russia's

01:00:16.559 --> 01:00:18.480
russia is just as far west as

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.480
are they japan and i think i think

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.720
russia would bomb new york city

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.960
you got to take that up with putin dude

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.359
i mean dude imagine if they nuked

01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:28.480
dc

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.520
everything's cool but all the

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.280
politicians are dead putin comes over

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.119
here he's like yo boys we're running the

01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:35.520
show now i think that's very plausible i

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.040
would join putin

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.160
you think so i'd be like dude i'm a

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.119
soviet i would soviet union up

01:00:41.119 --> 01:00:43.440
i'd tell him about you let me time you

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.640
out and be like hey there's a guy we

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.319
need to send to a ghoul he probably no

01:00:46.319 --> 01:00:47.520
wait did he probably make me his like

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.200
ministry of [ __ ] propaganda dude

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.839
you just have to send him a copy of

01:00:53.839 --> 01:00:55.119
overlook

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:57.200
imagine this on your side yeah exactly

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.720
instead of just out here maverick

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.480
imagine me in control of the sheep dude

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.079
what would your first book be if you

01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:03.920
were starting to write propaganda in the

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.079
new soviet america russian ghostbusters

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:07.839
russian response yeah that is the key

01:01:07.839 --> 01:01:09.440
dude that's what sparked this whole

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.760
thing what female ghostbusters do you

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.200
think that's what startups start to the

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.799
social no i'm saying that's what started

01:01:14.799 --> 01:01:16.319
started all the [ __ ] marxists coming

01:01:16.319 --> 01:01:17.920
out of caves in america

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.200
people were like yeah what do you have a

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.799
problem with women ghostbusters like we

01:01:20.799 --> 01:01:22.880

i think i think she was trying to hit

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.400
that ocean's eleven divorce money dude

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.599

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.599
top

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:19.520
maybe it could be though they're allowed

01:06:54.799 --> 01:06:57.760
it is funny the outrage of that what

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.359
of everybody being like he's [ __ ] he

01:06:59.359 --> 01:07:01.760

you just stand outside and it was so

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.440
funny

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.280
but uh but yeah so anyway the whole

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.320
point of i was telling you that they

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.719
knocked down her house after she died

01:22:16.719 --> 01:22:17.840
and then

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.600
she died not too long after

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.280
how did she die

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.639
who knows so i was off the block by then

01:22:22.639 --> 01:22:24.800
i got out i moved out of the hood yeah i

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.480
was i was in jersey how old do you think

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.000
she was

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.719
probably 55. all right so she it was it

01:22:30.719 --> 01:22:32.239
was ripe time to die yeah yeah she was

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:34.080
if you if you're running that life 55

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.920
[ __ ] she was redlining pretty [ __ ]

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.360
that's a good run yeah she was redlining

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.199
pretty hard but yeah i'm lucky to make

01:22:39.199 --> 01:22:40.960
it to 55. that's what i'm saying just

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.000
from like meat yeah from nitrates

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.120
but they ended up knocking down her

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.400
house but they had like a whole ceremony

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.400
and they like a pastor come in and that

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.159
area was apparently part of what was

01:22:50.159 --> 01:22:51.440
called like the

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.520
i'm gonna say promise owned by obama

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.960
where he like promised tons of money to

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.320
go into certain pockets of different

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.360
cities

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.639
which you know didn't really happen but

01:22:58.639 --> 01:23:01.679
the uh it didn't happen i mean i i still

01:23:01.679 --> 01:23:03.040
go up there all the time to see my house

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.880
obama you think he went to the back of

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.320
that i'm not saying he did he went into

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.000
that ford once or twice and was like all

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.440
right i think he lost a couple of bucks

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.040
no i mean it's just he threw that dog in

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.560
a government organization you got people

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.239
just people to start taking that money

01:23:14.239 --> 01:23:15.679
comes in they're like oh my we need to

01:23:15.679 --> 01:23:17.199
do this we need to do that and people

01:23:17.199 --> 01:23:18.560
over inflate [ __ ] you know they're like

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.400
well we got to build a new building and

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.320
people are just dude i knew a guy used

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:25.440
to work for pha building houses for them

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.040
and he used to order materials off of

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.520
pha's thing and have the city pay for

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.719

01:23:30.719 --> 01:23:32.480
a house on his on his own that shit's

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.840
happening left and right yeah of course

that's awesome dude well i think yeah so

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.920
they they built across the street

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.360
eventually

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.400
they built like it was just like eight

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.760
section eight houses i think one of my

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:44.400
favorite uh youtube videos or vines is a

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.320
black preacher at a funeral and he's

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.560
holding a dove he's like if i had wings

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:51.679
i would fly like this dove and then he

01:24:51.679 --> 01:24:54.719
throws it and it's dead and it just

01:24:54.719 --> 01:24:56.159
it just lands and all the black people

01:24:56.159 --> 01:24:58.400
are like oh

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.080
i think he's i think i saw that if i had

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.600
wings that would fly

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.920
like dude

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.159
it's like a dead it's great dude that's

01:25:06.159 --> 01:25:08.159
that's just like i mean the catholic

01:25:08.159 --> 01:25:09.440
church ever all of it that's i was

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.639
thinking about that today that's such a

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:12.880
wild business dude yeah to just

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.960
manufacture god and just be like yep we

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.000
got god

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.800
come here 10 it's not manufactured man

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.080
yeah but like to be like you got to

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.600
believe i mean my whole thing is that

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:24.960
like it's a place that then's god yeah

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:27.120
come in here like come on here

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.880
oh yeah i read the bible all the time

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.480
i'll tell you about it people are like

01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:31.920
people pay a lot of money for that no i

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.360
think there's important lessons in that

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.159
book

01:25:34.159 --> 01:25:35.679
yeah but i'm just saying it's a strange

01:25:35.679 --> 01:25:36.880
business that's crazy of course it

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:37.920
doesn't make sense like they said it

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.360
started when people didn't have bibles

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.040
and they weren't allowed to read them

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.480
that must've been tight dude you'd show

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:44.400
up like yo you're ready for church it's

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.840
actually god's word and this guy is the

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.040
only guy who can read he's gonna tell

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.400
him that must've been sick

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.760
imagine that guy being like i have all

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.280
the secrets of the universe i'll give

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.199
him to you once a week you gotta come

01:25:53.199 --> 01:25:54.480
like what's in that book like you're too

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.679
dumb to read it you'll never be able to

01:25:55.679 --> 01:25:57.360
read it and you're like [ __ ] [ __ ] he's

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.360
right gotta go to this damn church must

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.800
have been so sick dude church probably

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:01.679
would have been sick and then he'd be

01:26:01.679 --> 01:26:03.280
like yo we gotta kill this [ __ ] guy

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.960
i'd be like yes

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.840
yeah another public

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:09.440
execution how was your day yeah that'd

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.360
be sick nice i was actually thinking

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.840
about today about uh

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.600
how much

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.040
back in the day before like we fully had

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.239
houses or even like when it was native

01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:20.639
americans here how much like how often

01:26:20.639 --> 01:26:23.520
people would stumble across public sects

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.639
it must have happened all the time in

01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:25.920
like the 1700s you walk through the

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.080
woods and see some guy like oh oh he's

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.360
like humping some chicken behind the

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.639
tree and he's like oh jesus christ

01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:34.880
there's a lot less people but yes yeah

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:37.040
but still by having a lot more probably

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.639
run out that's when you're a kid you can

01:26:38.639 --> 01:26:40.159
only get [ __ ] outside pretty much if

01:26:40.159 --> 01:26:41.520
you see yeah yeah yeah because you can't

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.280
[ __ ] in their small-ass house

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.800
yeah

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.639
take them out in the woods you catch a

01:26:46.639 --> 01:26:47.920
couple kids that's where you find some

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.520
[ __ ] dude you see

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.280
you see some chick plowing some dude

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.639
she's on top you're like that's the

01:26:52.639 --> 01:26:53.920

right down yeah

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.080
that's a [ __ ] dude and then you could

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.840

01:28:40.719 --> 01:28:43.440
nice but these are levels of truth

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.280
thanks to the white society we created a

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:46.880
world where these guys this is how they

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.159
