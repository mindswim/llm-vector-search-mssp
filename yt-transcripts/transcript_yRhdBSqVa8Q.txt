if you give me a second you better

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.560
answer that sky is blue because it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.680
does not it it does not absorb

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.040
it absorbs

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.200
and this guy's dumb as [ __ ] dude yeah

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.560

i got [ __ ] well

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.040
i had a tough [ __ ] time isn't it this

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.479
that's water in the sky isn't there

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.920
something i think it's i don't think

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.680
it's water in this guy but i don't i do

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.159
think there's a lot to do with oxygen oh

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.280
i think that's why i don't like that i

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.920
think

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.560
it's something about it like go ahead

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.920
you know like your blood's blue before

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.200
it hits and it turns red that's what

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.439
everyone says dude i don't believe that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.439
i don't only know i have a phd in urban

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.200
legends dude the urban legend that

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.640
everybody's blood's blue inside until it

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.920
hits the air and then it turns around

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.040
that's why your veins are blue dude what

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.439
a stupid [ __ ]

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.479
[ __ ]

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.880
i believe some of your blood is blue and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.719
then it goes intelligent yeah to your

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.360
lungs some veins are blue yeah yeah

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.960

science

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.280
i know but that's i agree that that's a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.520
funny [ __ ] urban legend yeah that

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.599
your blood is always blue it is until it

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.360
hits the air and then it turns red it

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.720
turns red like it's magma into lava yep

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.200

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.480
dumbest thing i think i've ever said and

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.160
it sucks because my friend who i set it

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.680
to remembers it

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.120

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.560
so

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.200
i know somebody that was very

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.319
important at merrill lynch and when 9 11

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.760
happened

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.599
i came up somebody must have [ __ ]

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.040
told me you remember all those 911

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.800
rumors right

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.720
like there's a lot of urban legends

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.640
around it not just that but i mean like

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.480
it's true people being like there was an

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.920
arab kid here

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.519
on september 10th and he was like don't

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.519
come to [ __ ] work i didn't hear any

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.959
[ __ ] like [ __ ] terrorists like

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.080
somebody's yeah there was a bunch of

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.360
someone's lighting their face over there

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.720
somebody yeah somebody hit me with a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.040
terraced ghost story and i believed it

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.599
what was the ghost story was that

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.319
uh a couple executives

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.680
got out on a helicopter

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.680
it was really dumb i know they probably

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.159
did no exactly it's somewhat believable

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.120
but then

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.159
college

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.440
in college i said this

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.959
not like a classroom but we were just

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.319
sitting there and we were talking about

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.959
it and i was like you know

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.879
my uh my uncle worked at merrill lynch

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.799
and he told me

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.879
it was a couple guys got out a couple of

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.879
the executives got out on helicopters

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.319
this kid was immediately like you're a

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.680
[ __ ] idiot

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.879
he's like that's the dumbest [ __ ] i've

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.000
ever heard in my life i guess they had

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.439
the whole thing on camera the whole time

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.000
yeah definitely and also yeah no one

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.359
launched the helipad well definitely

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.720
that yeah nobody launched the helipad

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.560
there's hillary was seen [ __ ] taking

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.840
off in helicopter

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.280
i heard you could see hitler's face in

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.120
the smoke yeah i heard that too yeah

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.360
that happened but anyway i said that and

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.560
he uh

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.040
he brought that up to me like this year

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.639
he's like actually he was like remember

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.560
you said that that's believable

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.080
guys got to the chopper and got out of

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.000
there yeah but i think i said it like

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.880
pre

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.720
they [ __ ] preemptively

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.080
like they knew something was coming and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.000

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.960
angel

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.600
every time but buck angel is jacked and

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.520
has a vagina i've heard a lot of people

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.000
be like a buck angel i'd [ __ ] if the

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.160
[ __ ] counts and it's like actually it's

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.759
not the truth at all it's really

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.759
terrible i did my research dude it's

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.599
called a uh

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.520
erotical illusion that's what you're

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.080
that's how transgenders make is there

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.759
the transgender porn market is actually

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.080
like exclusively heterosexual man

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.599
i read there's a book a billion wicket

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:16.720
thoughts dude

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.800
it's so [ __ ] fun

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.240
they got into that dude and it's like

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.160
basically it's four heterosexual men and

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.520
they're combining

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.280
breasts hips and

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.360
other men's penis are uh

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.000
like a sexual cue for men because it

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.319
like triggers sperm uh competition

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.880
so that's why like all like dude

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.759
scientific about that

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.360
almost overwhelmingly there's more dudes

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.479
to girls

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:46.240
there's like nine man [ __ ] slams there's

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.639
not like nine chicks one dude that fires

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:51.039
dudes up other dudes come so if you

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:53.919
cross tits a butt and a dick if you're

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:56.240
firing all kinds of crazy brain

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.759
and the only thing that like so the

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:01.280
women's version of that guess what it is

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.680
vampires and [ __ ]

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.520
that's right that's a weird thing of

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.360
like it's a weird combination of like

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.199
supernatural stuff and they like so if

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:11.520
you catch a girl watching that like

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.120
vampire diaries that's their training

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.120
porn dude twilight's training porn for

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.440
girls

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.160
thought that was pretty interesting

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.479
yeah listen i mean i i i think i

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:23.759
remember reading there was like a book

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:25.120

about that well i just i i see you

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.959
recall the idea about like you if you're

00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:36.560
in competition with other males then

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.560
you're gonna have more potent sperm yeah

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.320

all right

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:51.360

watching twilight is their training porn

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.600
i even tested my girlfriend watched

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.959
every episode of vampire diaries i'm

00:09:56.959 --> 00:09:57.920
like do you think vampires are

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.680
attractive and she was like no

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.519
exact same response as a dude being like

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:04.480
did you [ __ ] bailly james

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.880
it was the exact same response

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.120
no no i was like this is your training

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.120
point dude the listeners missed how well

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.040
he pantomimed that

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.360
yeah for sure exactly sort of like yes

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.200
but there's one thing there's one thing

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.279
i do and i think we talked about getting

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:20.880
some cameras down here

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.640
to at least put up some clips but

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.000
there's one thing that the listeners

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.040
always miss out on is when matt goes on

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.440
a rant like he just did and all you can

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.800
see is

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.279
darkness and candles and then his face

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:36.399
lit up by the computer screen and he's

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:38.480
like dead serious like and that's what

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.959
cuckoldry porn is so hot it's like

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:43.040
dude you're a maniac some heavy [ __ ]

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.000
knowledge

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.160
this [ __ ] book a million little

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.480
thoughts a billion wikileaks destroyed

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.000
you it's dude it's the best it's

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.360
literally the best book ever read i

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.279
heard i heard jordan peterson reverence

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:56.640
it in one of his it's such a good read

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.399
i gotta read it that's why i do that's

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:00.640
why like you know why women typically

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.920
you have a girlfriend like you go home

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.959
you usually don't feel like doing

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:04.000
anything they're always like we gotta go

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.240
places we gotta go places they wanna see

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.920
you interact with other males and they

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.920
like judge you on how you interact with

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.880
other men

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.320
it makes sense so that's why i like when

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.760
you're when you're out of the movies too

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.959
they don't if you sit at home with your

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:16.079
girlfriend all the time and never take

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:17.920
her out anywhere she's just like man

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.720
yeah just to see you dominate other men

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.800
she has to see you do stand up i mean

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.360
talk about the [ __ ] the ultimate like

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.440
it's really funny because if i'm just at

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.320
a bar by myself or like with friends not

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.640
one girl is gonna [ __ ] talk to me

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.160
yeah not really

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.760
but if i go do stand-up and do well

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.839
you know yeah it's unreal it's hilarious

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:41.680
i used to do stand-up and it was the

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.079
exact same yeah it's so funny yeah every

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.079
hot chick's like oh my god you're so

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:48.640
funny what are you doing that's like

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.640
social status crazy and then what's

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.800
really funny is you leave that club and

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.160
walk to the next bar and it's like oh

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.480
yeah i'm a [ __ ] zero true you know

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.079
what i mean yeah it's about like when

00:11:58.079 --> 00:11:59.600
you cross here to comedy club and then

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.760
you leave and go to like bards or

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.839
another bar wherever we go and you just

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:05.279
sit there and you're like

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:07.279

a numbers game right to most of it it's

00:20:07.679 --> 00:20:09.360
like if you you got to put yourself out

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.760
there a lot and then you get

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.600
somebody you see what happens that's a

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.840
nice way of putting it

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.200
but it's just hard to do that because

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.400
you do have to

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.240
like either adopt the mentality of a

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.200
sociopath or like not

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.679
not let reality hit you you know it's

00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:26.960
like if you do something ten times it

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.480
doesn't work typically you'll be like oh

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.840
yeah you gotta you gotta put your dick

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.559
out there dude speaking of sociopaths

00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:34.640
yeah there's a guy on the main board

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.159
his name's don't hate me bro he's the

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:38.320
[ __ ] man he likes notre dame he's a

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.000
friend of the podcast

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.320
his tinder game

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.799
is otherworldly i've never seen anything

00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:46.799
like it and he posts some of the [ __ ]

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:48.559
conversations on there jesus christ like

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:52.559
conversations it's crazy because what's

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:55.840
he saying just [ __ ] chicks with like

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.400
he and he's he's smart

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.320
so he's like clearly just manipulating

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.480
people it's crazy like he'll post a gif

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.240
and response and like

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.240

[ __ ] weird and there's other guys on

stock but he's got a sense of humor that

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.720
relates to women right so like he'll say

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.919

nazi dude steve explain antifa

gonna

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:15.360
if you're saying like interpret i think

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.200
like the main

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.919
issue is is criticism whether or not

00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:22.480
you're allowed to criticize ideas or not

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.080
and so like from both ends of the

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.799
political spectrum from like

00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:29.679
you can have the people who this comes

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:30.960
from jonathan roush's book kindly

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.120

00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:40.159
steve does a good job of citing whatever

00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:42.400
the [ __ ] he's saying yep because i'm an

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.720
idiot because i like if you get me

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.360
slightly out of the narrow band of

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.039
something that i've read i don't know

00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:50.880
what i'm talking about

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.559
they're not my ideas but yeah yeah you

00:25:52.559 --> 00:25:55.440

[ __ ] sharia law to matt dude he's

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.720
beheading anybody i just don't think

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.440
dicks plunge watch those plungers dude

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.520
all right sorry steve explain anthony i

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.200
mean uh so if

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.640
let me just try it this way then you can

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.200
tell me if this sucks but if our goal is

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.480
to

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.720
make progress as a culture yeah which is

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.039
like the key right we need to

00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:32.720
we need to make progress we can't be

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.960
stagnant because then we die which

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.919
sounds crazy but that's that's true no a

00:26:37.919 --> 00:26:39.120
problem comes and you're like i don't

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.400
know what to do and then you're dead

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.960
that's how empires fall exactly yes so

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.240
we need to make progress and the way in

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.760
which we make progress is through this

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.120
simple method of trial and error

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.240
correction

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.039
but that it sounds simple but

00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:52.960
there's this important facet to it which

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.000
is like it's dependent on criticism

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.840
so

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.760
here's why criticism matters let's say i

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.919
tell you the statement all swans are

00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:04.000
white okay can i ever prove that

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.279
completely true

00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:07.520
no because i may not have seen every

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.840
single swan that exists i've been what

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.600
should i keep going yeah please this is

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.360
perfect i just thought of a funny swan

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.679
story do it please god

00:27:15.679 --> 00:27:17.760
there were two swans at millersville

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.679
in this pond in the middle of like by

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:21.520
the dorms they had a pond

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.880
and there were two swans and they were

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.880
like millersville's i forget their names

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.159
or it was like black and yellow not

00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:27.679
black and yellow but like

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:28.640
something

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.760
they were named after the school and

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.279
they were like mascots unofficial

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:33.440
mascots and somebody got [ __ ] up and

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.080
beheaded one of them just left

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.559
they painted two swans no no the

00:27:38.559 --> 00:27:41.919
swans were like named like marauder and

00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:44.559
[ __ ] melee yeah yeah and so cut the

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:46.240
[ __ ] head off like i would assume a

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.799
[ __ ] muslim broke in there

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:50.960
[ __ ] one of those they committed to

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.880
sin anyway go ahead sorry i thought it

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.399
was really funny to kill an animal for a

00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:56.480
school that's pretty funny

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.760
well i think it's set

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.399
[Laughter]

00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:03.120
but uh okay so if i say all swans are

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.960
white can i ever prove that

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.279
certainly true no because you know i may

00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:08.640
not have seen every single swan i

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.080
certainly don't know that every swan

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.679
born in the future will be white but if

00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:13.600
i tell you all swans are white and then

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.240
we observe just one black swan then we

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.559
know for a fact that not all swans are

00:28:18.559 --> 00:28:21.840
white but so with the black swans faster

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.799
of course

00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:23.760
shane

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.039
that is racist so so the key there

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:29.679
though is that we can definitely prove

00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:31.679
things false we can't necessarily prove

00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:33.360
things true so

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.279
that's how that's how we separate good

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:37.200
ideas from bad ideas we have we start

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.559
out with a problem we come up with all

00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:40.399
these different ideas to solve it and

00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:42.159
then we systematically go through and

00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:44.799
try to prove our ideas false

00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:46.799
and we do that through criticism it can

00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:49.360
either be like argument or it can be

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.320
peer review or whatever but

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.240
when we get to an idea that tries we can

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.159
we cannot prove it wrong that's new

00:28:56.159 --> 00:28:58.399
knowledge so when we look at like social

00:28:58.399 --> 00:29:00.080
justice warriors a lot of what they're

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.360
trying to do is

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.279
prevent who can criticize ideas yeah and

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:07.440
that's a problem and so it's like

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.960
fascists do that

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.279
of like you know jews can't criticize an

00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:13.600
idea and then social justice warriors do

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.640
it because they'd say well you're gonna

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.640
hurt somebody's feelings yeah and that's

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.159
the whole thing it's like the knowledge

00:29:18.159 --> 00:29:21.520
creation game is not down with your

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.559
feelings

00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:25.440
it's just not it so damn and uh one

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.480
thing that

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.600
like uh because what was it mao in china

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.600
it was his communist

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.080
dictatorship in china one of the things

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.760
that they got a lot of trouble for was

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.840
he was having starvation

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.679
all over china and nobody would report

00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:40.720
it to him

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.480
because they knew criticism resulted in

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.840
[ __ ] death

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.679
so like none of his top aides who knew

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:47.760
about all these horrific i mean

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.080
literally millions of people dying i

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.760
just wouldn't report it to him because

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.279
he'd be like what the [ __ ] because in

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:55.679
those types of governments you can't

00:29:55.679 --> 00:29:57.039
criticize anything you can't be like

00:29:57.039 --> 00:29:59.360
dude your [ __ ] new policy with

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.120
agriculture is killing millions of

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.880
people yeah or you're out

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.720
so do you think they'll ever get the

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.159
like the type that's like i can see that

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:07.279
being a stretch being like well dude

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:09.279
will anti-fog really rise up and become

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:11.200
like a dictatorship it's like

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.120
no of course not probably not but dude

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.399
like imagine them just being [ __ ]

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:16.159
annoying forever that would suck they're

00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:17.279
not they're gonna they're they are

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:19.760
changing little things they'll fade away

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.520
this whole thing will fade away yeah but

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.960
like you're grade school now it's like

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.240
you get like a piece of paper and it's

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.720
like yeah gender rhinoceros and like

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.520
yeah

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.120
that's [ __ ] weird to be like that is

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.880
very weird second grade

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.320
then like i have to tell a second grader

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.840
like yeah i kind of think a lot of that

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.760
stuff's kind of [ __ ] yeah then they

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.960
go in they're like my dad so this is

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.120
[ __ ] yeah so you it's like you know

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.000
your kid is making you be like yeah

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.840
that's how it is no you know your kid

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.000
sent to the principal office with you

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.039
yeah and they're like why did you tell

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:48.640
your kid this was [ __ ] what are you

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.039
transphobic yeah it's pretty weird it's

00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:53.360
an institutionalized version of changing

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.200
the way people think and act and they

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.520
are doing a good job of that but

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.679
i don't think they're a serious threat

00:30:59.679 --> 00:31:01.600
that's threatening that's [ __ ] it's

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.279
weird that's a weird way and that's why

00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:05.200
i think there's a lot of uh

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.559
and i think we're gonna see it a lot now

00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:08.000
of like kids

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.480
being like i'm gay or i'm trans yeah

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.880
like young kids yeah because i mean

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.799
think how impressionable they are and if

00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:16.720
if your parents a [ __ ] lunatic that's

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.200
like look how brave all these people are

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.039
they're so powerful of course the little

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:22.799
kid's gonna be like i'm brave and

00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:23.919
powerful

00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:25.840
i'm actually a girl

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.120
[ __ ] you know what i mean there's a lot

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.120
of that coming up too yeah there are a

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.880
lot more that's the other thing too it's

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.640
like do you think that

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.520
it was frowned upon to be transsexual

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.120
and now a lot of people are becoming

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.960
trans there's like way more transsexual

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.279
people now in the last three years yeah

00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:42.960
like i did like i'll just when i shop at

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.279
whole foods it's like dudes and dresses

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:46.720
everywhere i think it's somewhere in the

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.960
middle like most things like i think

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.120
obviously all this all these new rights

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.799
gay rights and all these all these new

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:54.880
movements like allowed people to be more

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.039
comfortable yeah and come out but i also

00:31:57.039 --> 00:31:58.559
think there's a ton of people that are

00:31:58.559 --> 00:31:59.519
like

00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:01.519
well this is i i have nothing going on

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.640
in my life

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.159
this is something that would gain me a

00:32:04.159 --> 00:32:05.760
lot of attention

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.440
i'm trans

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.960
i think there's a lot of that dude

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.640
that's wild

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.960
i mean that's what i think yeah

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.880
i know but i see a lot of half-assed

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.440
[ __ ] people transit i heard i heard and

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.679
this is crazy i think i heard it on

00:32:19.679 --> 00:32:22.159
joe rogan's podcast which is well

00:32:22.159 --> 00:32:25.600
basically doctrine that's dogma and uh

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.480
i think in canada like if your kid

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.640
yeah this is a stretch this is basically

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.799
like that story i thought but uh

00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:33.679
yeah

00:32:33.679 --> 00:32:36.399
i think if your kid is like i'm

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:37.519
like let's say you have a little boy and

00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:39.440
he's like i'm a girl if you don't start

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.480
giving him like hormone treatments

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.960
i think the state can administer that

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.880
well i think that's where they're trying

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.720
to get that pushed

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.000
and that's a [ __ ] terrifying

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.679
dangerous place where the state is

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:53.039
apparent

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:55.519
you know that's a [ __ ] wild way to go

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:56.720
and i think that's

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.559
so they think they will get they'll get

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:00.480
paid like power like that a gay black

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.600
dude be like you can never understand

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.799
what it's like to be me and then it'll

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:04.399
be like well here's here's how your life

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.440
is and it's like well how the [ __ ] are

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.120
you how did you get everything it's like

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.640
that's the move but it's also the same

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.600
time it's

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.600
pretty possible to ignore all of that

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.919
kind of stuff and just go about your day

00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:15.039
yeah and they hear them pop up and

00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:16.640
you're like huh that's a weird which is

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.039
it's funny anytime i go home yeah that's

00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:21.039
what everyone's doing yeah that's what

00:33:21.039 --> 00:33:23.279
the rest of the country is doing is just

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:24.559
being like

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:26.159
like my dad would turn on the news and

00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:27.600
see like something like charlottesville

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.080
and seeing nazis and [ __ ] antifa and

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.919
just be like these people are [ __ ]

00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:34.240
idiots

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.519
and he would come home and work and pay

00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:38.960
his taxes

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.080
yeah

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.200
it's weird to think that they're going

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.519
to have kids like the anti-fog we'll

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:45.440
meet in anti-foss have kids be like

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.360
everything's [ __ ] up you're [ __ ] up

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.640
[ __ ] this

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.559
yeah there's i again though it's as

00:33:50.559 --> 00:33:52.159
unfucked up as it's ever been in the

00:33:52.159 --> 00:33:53.600
history of the planet it's just as good

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.600
as it's ever been easy for you to say

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.279
steve yeah steve you go ahead give it to

00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:58.559
me

00:33:58.559 --> 00:34:00.559
[ __ ] yeah of course it's easy for you

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:02.960
but we can also look at data yeah yeah

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.159
yeah yeah no what was i saw something do

00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:07.760
you remember that [ __ ] world war ii

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.200
video i showed you about like the data

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.280
it showed you the number of casualties

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.119
in each country and all that stuff it's

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:14.399
crazy it's a really cool thing you

00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:16.480
should check out but at the end of it he

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.320
talks about the period of peace that

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.760
we're in and it

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.000
shows the countries with like the top 40

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.599
gdps

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:25.440
in the world and none of them are at war

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.879
with each other and it's the first time

00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:28.399
that's ever happened and

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.879
as long as humanity's been recorded

00:34:30.879 --> 00:34:32.320
really yeah

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.159
is that there's not a major conflict in

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.320
the entire world

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.800
and it's been that way since

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.200
i don't know world war ii yeah that was

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.960
it

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.480
can i also jump in on like that one

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.919
point that you were making about how

00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:48.079
like if somebody says well you're not

00:34:48.079 --> 00:34:50.000
you know a gay black man therefore you

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.800
can't have any idea

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.599
that just fundamentally misunderstands

00:34:55.599 --> 00:34:57.839
how again knowledge is created and how

00:34:57.839 --> 00:34:59.440
we make progress like

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.320
the whole reason we open ideas up for

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.079
criticism is because we assume that

00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:06.320
everybody is coming with a bias you've

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.800
got your bias i've got mine we test our

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.560
ideas in the marketplace of conversation

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.800
and we see what happens but if you if

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.119
you go the other way and say well you

00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:17.440
can't think of the right answer because

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.200
you're not this then that's just saying

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.280
you think with your blood

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.920
that is like they start to how you want

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.960
to start persecuting jews

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.280
step one you think with your blood so

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.200
you therefore you can't have this

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.760
thought you can't understand this [ __ ]

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.680
so it's like

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.200
again that's what i find frustrating

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.240
about it is

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.880
we've got this incredible system of

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.359
knowledge creation that is protected by

00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:44.560
the west

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.880
and yet these people like

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.880
don't understand how it works yeah it's

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.000
like

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.880
it is a staggering accomplishment the

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.720
[ __ ] that we're able to do

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.440
at some point you know i

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.320
with medicine or flying around or like

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.599
yeah you know all this stuff it's like

00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:03.839
what led to this aren't you remotely

00:36:03.839 --> 00:36:05.680
concerned yeah it wasn't one guy being

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.640
like um thank you but we got this okay

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.040
[ __ ] you right yeah it's true it's like

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.480
if you do something great you kind of

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.760
you try and pick it apart and be like

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.359
what happened why did that work and now

00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:17.040
let's replicate this yeah why why was

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.520
there just a boom of inventions in the

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.960
united states

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.240
at the turn of the senate like why was

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.560
there this why is the united states this

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.400
this place where all these

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.160
crazy inventions are coming out and all

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.800
this crazy [ __ ] and it's like

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.320
maybe we should exactly like you said

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.400
try to replicate that yeah what's going

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.680
on there

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.320
it's free thought and yet and yet

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.040
you'd say we need to go communism are

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.760
you like

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.720
on the face that's insane yeah

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.359
and then like it also

00:36:49.359 --> 00:36:50.880
you know this is a big point from david

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.280
deutsch where again it's just like the

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.040
moment we stop creating knowledge we're

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.520
dead and and most civilizations that

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.359
have ever lived are dead most species

00:36:59.359 --> 00:37:01.119
that have ever lived are dead and it's

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:03.280
just a matter of time then like

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.280
nature's gonna get us in some way that

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.040
we don't know and

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.640
the only thing that keeps us pacing

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.119
ahead of nature is our unique ability

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:13.440
that humans have in the cosmos to create

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.400
knowledge

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.880
and that happens in very very limited

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.320
societies

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.599
and

00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:20.720
for

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.800
right now it is the west and that's it

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.359
yeah so so if we go out on you're saying

00:37:25.359 --> 00:37:26.560
we're about to go out on some [ __ ]

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.160
[ __ ] [ __ ] right now steve like could

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.520
you do this could you check your [ __ ]

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.240
privilege right now

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.280
your white well let me let me let me not

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.280
check it because the whole point is so

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.280
here we go steve

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.160
here's the thing that like i i didn't um

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.040
okay

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.119
this is a raising

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:47.280
tide brings up all ships or whatever the

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.880
[ __ ] however you want to say yeah but

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.359
it's like okay so let's even think about

00:37:51.359 --> 00:37:53.119
immigration and so somebody's coming

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:54.800
from guatemala they're getting there's a

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.640
push right from guatemala which is like

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.480
they've got [ __ ] nothing there's no

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.640
electricity there's just dirt past they

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.920
can't get [ __ ]

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.720
but if you if we could through the

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.800
knowledge creating machine that is the

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.359
west create things like

00:38:09.359 --> 00:38:13.440
solar energy we can um we can have 3d

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.880
printers that are basically working off

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.560
of like trash now you can get them their

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.400
own goods so that there's no longer a

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.680
push they can they can have zero

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.240
marginal cost like a [ __ ] drone flies

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.480
them out a 3d printer yeah you know this

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.720
is all stuff it's like india they never

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.400
put up telephone poles because they just

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.000
kind of skipped over and they had cell

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.400
phones [ __ ] and so like that can happen

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.040
in these these kinds like so

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.320
it is

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.720
the privilege or whatever that means

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.240
is like the thing that's going to help

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.359
people

00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:45.520
yeah in the world we yeah where did we

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.960
discuss this we were talking about we

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.560
were at bards we're at the bar talking

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.359
about this yeah about how like

00:38:51.359 --> 00:38:52.880
so i don't mean to be on a no no no no

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.400
no no exactly

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.079
this is the first [ __ ] intellectual

00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:58.079
episode we've had true smartest episode

00:38:58.079 --> 00:39:01.200
42 we're smart now you gay [ __ ]

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.119
you dumb [ __ ] we're smart all right

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:04.240
uh

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.160
we were talking about how like every

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.000
problem creates another problem but

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.440
we're still building towards them like

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.200
in india when they

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.119
what they do like there was a starvation

00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:15.200
epidemic and they

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.079
ngos and all that [ __ ] with food yep

00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:20.320
they were able to feed everyone

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.839
and now there's an overpopulation

00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:23.760
problem but there's always like you need

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.839
to always keep working to solve the next

00:39:25.839 --> 00:39:26.720
problem

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.240
you know what i'm doing absolutely can i

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.720
say can i almost like re-say that yes

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.880
better say it better no because i think

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.720
it's i think it's a really important one

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.400
because this is another uh thing that

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.160
you'd get so people that are like

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.480
anti-gmo right yeah okay well let's

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.640
understand what what this all came about

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.800
what's a gmo genetically modified

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.640
organism okay uh crops yeah yeah yeah so

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.560
uh what you were alluding to first is

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.160
this aphorism by david deutsch that

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.920
problems are inevitable but problems are

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.640
solvable and then

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.800
like a saying i guess here we go yep

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.160
we're rolling write it down suck our

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.320
dicks listeners everybody who called us

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.079
dumb suck our dicks once again that's

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:05.520
david deutsch yeah we're talking

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.160
deutsche aphorisms

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.839
anything you want to [ __ ] bring at us

00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:12.400
we'll [ __ ] talk good

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.800
so get them stevie so

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.720
so you've got this problem in this in

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.440
like the late 60s and 70s which is like

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.520
india's headed for a mass starvation and

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.640
there was a

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.160
guy named paul ehrlich that wrote about

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.440
it in his book called the population

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.040
bomb he's like there's going to be

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.320
everybody there is going to die you know

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.720
all this like nay-saying [ __ ] and while

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.760
he was doing that norman borlaug the

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.680
scientist was solving the problem he

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.520
created this genetically modified wheat

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.000
crop it grew a higher yield in a smaller

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.119
area required less water and and as matt

00:40:43.119 --> 00:40:44.720
ridley writes he's like before the ink

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.200
was even dry in ehrlich's book

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.119
norman borlaug solved the problem and

00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:50.880
he's credited with saving you can google

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.920
this at a low estimate a billion lives

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.200
yeah a billion and so so then what this

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.400
is what's frustrating when people go

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.800
well [ __ ] gmos and blah blah it's

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.280
like do you okay you can sit here in

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.839
your privileged area yeah and what but

00:41:05.839 --> 00:41:07.920
it's like if you get rid of gmos tons of

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.359
people die yeah

00:41:09.359 --> 00:41:11.760
but they're africans you know or indians

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.440
and so you don't yes you want to talk

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.960
about yeah you want to talk about

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.800
free-range chickens and free-range

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.240
cattle and all that it's like yeah

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.400
that's a nice thing for us to have but

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.240
it's also vital to free range is

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.200
different because that's kind of

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.400
standard in a lot of third world

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.400
countries no no but i'm saying we're

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.319
able to mass produce tons of [ __ ]

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:29.280
teeth

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.760
yeah because they're not free range

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.760
if we went if there was just full free

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.960
range on everything that would be a

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.079
problem

00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:36.800
yeah

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.319
like [ __ ] like that

00:41:38.319 --> 00:41:39.440
what do you think

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.359
it's hard when you

00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:43.839
try and get people in developing

00:41:43.839 --> 00:41:45.599
countries to live to the standards of

00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:48.480
the west and this is like one of the i

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.720
took global warming is a thing

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.800
i think global warming is a thing okay

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.200
but then when you take a country and you

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.119
say well you have to live up to certain

00:41:57.119 --> 00:41:59.200
regulations with the environment but

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.000
they

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.520
this is what they need in order to start

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.720
developing

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.880
you really are conscripting people to

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.400
suffer a lot

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.560
and so what we would what i at least

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.480
think the conversation about global

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.000
warming should be is we're going to need

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.319
a technological solution to that problem

00:42:14.319 --> 00:42:15.599
so we're going to have to cool the

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:16.720
planet

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.040
which we can do like again david deutsch

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.560
had a tweet he was like if aliens showed

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.839
up and they were they were like you have

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:23.200
two years to kill

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.319
cool the planet otherwise we're gonna

00:42:24.319 --> 00:42:25.920
kill you we would do it

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.280
how the [ __ ] do they call the planet oh

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.720
they've got they've already got like so

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.560
many different stop dude

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.480
yeah they can do it yeah yeah we can do

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.680
it why don't they [ __ ] do this

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.720
because they're just wanting to make

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.720
sure the [ __ ] today

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.520
pull that [ __ ] down helium

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.720
the comedy club i don't wanna sweat

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.079
anymore what the [ __ ] what do they gotta

00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:43.359
turn on

00:42:43.359 --> 00:42:45.200
they've got different ideas of how to do

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.480
it they just want to make sure what's

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.000
the safest way just giant air

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.680
conditioner

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.960
maybe

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.880
that might be necessary please do that

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.720
but anyway that's just speaking to uh

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.560
yeah no i agree that's like being like

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.280
hey yemen or [ __ ]

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.480
congo

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.480
move to solar

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.640
it's like they should they can't do it

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.000
yeah well they just can't but if someone

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.440
hooked him up with the tech it was like

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.280
here well i don't even think we're

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.800
hooking ourselves up with the tactics oh

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.720
we got detectives maybe france will

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.160
[ __ ] when we get the green light dude

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.640
we're ready

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.560
we got some good [ __ ] soul there's no

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.760
way they haven't figured out all that

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.440
[ __ ] already yes yeah there is but

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.880

of that [ __ ] that's just really in the

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.560
way of i'm sure

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.079
in the way of that type of production i

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:34.000
love that big money but you love big

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.359
that's in the way i love people i

00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:37.440
thought you're angry about dude no i'm

dude it's good to have you back hell

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.960
yeah capitalism's best solar is not real

solar's fake dude you just saw that

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.839
eclipse coal coal and oil dude

00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:54.640
all i care about is coal yeah

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.400

00:43:58.319 --> 00:44:00.640
jim thorpe pa

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.240
we need some miners that is funny you're

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.839
talking about how people if you if you

00:44:03.839 --> 00:44:06.800
can't talk about stuff the next step is

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.040
just fighting like if you lose the

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.400
ability to be like yeah but here's what

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.839
i if they're like [ __ ] you it's like all

00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:12.880
right now we're going to just finish

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.160
that's it and it's like

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.359
people don't think about that if you

00:44:15.359 --> 00:44:17.200
can't say what's on your mind all you

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.280
all you can do is a strangle a person

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.280
and the implica because right now

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.560
there's so many times that people are

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.720
equating words with violence and you're

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.880
like just play that through in your head

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.200
yeah and again in roush's book he writes

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.960
about this where it was like when salman

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.000
rushdie wrote his book that um

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.880
satanist yeah yeah satanic verses

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.319
it offended the ayatollah so what so he

00:44:40.319 --> 00:44:42.560
was ayatollah was offended so then he

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.839
said you must die because to the

00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:48.000
ayatollah words are

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.839
no different from violence and yet

00:44:49.839 --> 00:44:52.640
that's what exactly what's muslims sjw's

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.000
what do you think of muslims what do i

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.119
think about muslims yeah i think they're

00:44:55.119 --> 00:44:57.040
getting offended by words dude

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.160
yeah i mean they're all dependent on the

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.560
kill over some words dude the hardcore

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.079
ones yeah well yeah obviously i'm not

00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:05.200
talking about [ __ ] mohamed weinberg

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.800
i'm not talking about [ __ ]

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.160
i'm not talking about mecchi trying to

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.000
be head people over the satanic verses

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.200
yeah they get to definitely get the most

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.520
butt hurt about words no doubt and we

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.440
actually talking to islam we had that

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.440
conversation today because i was talking

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.880
about how

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.040
like in charlottesville like the nazis

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.640
apparently all [ __ ] 300 of them yeah

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.920
it's like dude

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.160
that's that's not

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.240
a population we should be worried about

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.200
no what 300 [ __ ] dumb white guy like

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.119
it's such a small population and then

00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:36.319
steve was like what do you think that

00:45:36.319 --> 00:45:38.960
equates at all to islam and he was just

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.480
trying to play

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.119
satanic verse advocate sure saying like

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:45.520
if does the same argument then apply

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.079
to yeah and my argument was

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:50.560
absolutely not because

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.040
white american nazis aren't running any

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.760
[ __ ] entire regions of the world

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.839
and uh and then i was like also a

00:45:57.839 --> 00:46:00.480
liberal [ __ ] would be like uh actually

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.880
donald trump's a nazi so

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.520
they pretty much run america the clan

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.800
and nazis run america and it's like

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.880
why is that where we're at and

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.359
i i don't know this idea is just a

00:46:13.359 --> 00:46:15.040
thought but like isn't it

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.359
taking a photo of a nazi like way worse

00:46:17.359 --> 00:46:20.079
than anything else you can do you just

00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:22.079
some [ __ ] [ __ ] guy in a t-shirt

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:23.680
that has a quote from adolf hitler on

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.280
the back of it

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.400
that should be seen by four people in

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.480
southwest virginia

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.640
his friends his family and the guy that

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.760
works at the gas station yeah that

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.000
shouldn't be a lot of people see that

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.040
true

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.440
but there's a there's a lot of profit to

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:43.200
be made when it comes to uh

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.640
racism

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.000
oh hell and that's that's what's really

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.359
been bothering me about this whole thing

00:46:47.359 --> 00:46:48.240
because

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.000
i think i think and i said this to you

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.400
earlier i was like yeah there's

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.839
like in boston it's like all right

00:46:53.839 --> 00:46:59.359
there's 40 nazis and 900 photographers

00:46:59.359 --> 00:47:00.720
you know what i mean it's pretty much

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.599
we've given these [ __ ] idiots

00:47:03.599 --> 00:47:05.520
the biggest platform we've given anybody

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.160
in our entire country right now

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:08.880
is

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.480
like think of the [ __ ] nazi from that

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.800
vice episode that white nationalists

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.040
yeah everybody knows him now

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.119
the guy who's eating the unknown it's

00:47:17.119 --> 00:47:19.119
true he's a [ __ ] idiot what do you

00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:20.640
think about the protesters getting paid

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.760
to be there

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.720
i don't know about do you believe in

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.800
that at all what about that i've heard

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.200
before that well there was a thing on um

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.240
apparently the the clinton

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.160
administration got caught a couple times

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.520
yeah i saw that one reporter was like

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.119
yeah they've told us like they'll put

00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:34.640
people there to like get it to make sure

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.880
it escalates in chicago particularly

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.880
where that trump trump rally in chicago

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.160
got cancelled

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.920
because there was violence incited and

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.359
apparently a lot of the democrats in

00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:47.119
chicago were responsible for that but

00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:48.960
the whole thing is like

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.240
number one

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.160
the democrats are clearly profiting off

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.200
this

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.680
clearly yeah like this is clearly like a

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.839
we're the right party

00:47:57.839 --> 00:48:00.640
correct party right now look at what the

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.560
look at what the republicans brought you

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.280
they gave you nazis yeah i mean it's a

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.440
good move by them to be like

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.040
and i mean this is going to make me

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.200
sound a little alex jonesy but the

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.760
[ __ ] liberal media just perpetuating

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.680
this every single day because racism

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.280
sells in america

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.000
of like every single day being like look

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
at these nazis here look at that what is

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.200
this

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.640
well there's it's it's like dude they're

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.480
idiots it's slowly they're like it's

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.240
slowly gaining and they're like they're

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.839
slowly getting more powerful and it's

00:48:29.839 --> 00:48:32.240
like it's they're not i doubt it how

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.440
many people showed up to the rally in

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.680
boston how many less than 100 and they

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.000
all hung out in like a gazebo

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.079
boston commons and they were surrounded

00:48:40.079 --> 00:48:43.520
by 20 000 counter protesters dude you

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.040
know how dumb you have to be to be a

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.319
[ __ ]

00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:49.040
one of 20 000 counter protesters to be

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.480
like nazis are coming not in my city

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.040
yeah nazis aren't coming but why is that

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.319
dumb like to

00:48:56.319 --> 00:48:59.200
uh to come out and say you know

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.000
you know kind of we don't want you here

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.760
i mean you're allowed to yeah but you're

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.200
only making their voice stronger if

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.640
that's what you're doing right if you're

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.920
coming out you totally ignore them and

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.640
being like these are nazis it's like no

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.680
these are 40 dumb white guys

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.880
fat [ __ ] idiots standing by

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.720
themselves holding up don't tread on me

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.359
flags just like just let them go

00:49:21.359 --> 00:49:23.119
they are worst be fun like when you're

00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:24.800
with your boys being a nazi or they're

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.480
hanging out and like you go out to the

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.240
people and you're like ah [ __ ] dude i

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.559
don't know if i really

00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:33.839
you see a crowd of people being like

00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:35.520
[ __ ] you guys and it's like we're just

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.040
here for free speech i guess it does

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.359
make you kind of significant it it makes

00:49:39.359 --> 00:49:40.960
them i mean it's like [ __ ] walking

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.800
onto a stage in front of 20 000 people

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.400
they're literally standing on a stage

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.240
you're saying twenty thousand modern day

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:49.359
rock stars they are being modern

00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:51.040
they're the beatles so nazis are the new

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.559
chefs right now

00:49:52.559 --> 00:49:54.640
the chefs chefs are like the current

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.720
rock stars now it's nazis yes sick nazis

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.720
have been given a platform that they

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.800
should never [ __ ] have yeah and our

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.760
whole country is in this hysteria of

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.839
if you're not ridiculous are you like

00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:08.640
just

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.599
basically

00:50:09.599 --> 00:50:10.960
picking up where hitler left off you're

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.040
like we gotta get are they like german

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.960
are they like all about germany still or

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.800
no no no they're all about is that what

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.960
a neo-nazi is they have an american nazi

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.640
yeah i think it's about like

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.960
i think the 14 words or whatever they

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.400
all live by or whatever it's like we

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.079
need to create this isn't going to be 14

00:50:26.079 --> 00:50:27.680
words but the gist of it's like we need

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.079
to create a better

00:50:30.079 --> 00:50:32.319
life for white families and white

00:50:32.319 --> 00:50:33.680
children that's what a nazi is right

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.880
that's what they're doing it's not like

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.480
they're not trying to pick up or they're

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.400
not trying to kill all the jews yeah

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.160
okay i mean i'm sure that's what this is

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.760
that i don't know because i hear people

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.960
call it nazi i don't know the [ __ ] they

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.960
are yeah well if you're well right now

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.480
if you're a republican they're just like

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.079
captain america's dude they just got

00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:49.839
unfrozen in time they're like oh [ __ ]

00:50:49.839 --> 00:50:51.760
we're still gone

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.040
it's also kind of a bizarre thing

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.400
because they didn't lose the war right

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.440
so it's like

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.599
it's almost like playing imaginary guns

00:50:57.599 --> 00:51:00.960
it's like i shot you it's like no oh

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.880
i'm back

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.000
i don't know i just think the whole

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.119
thing

00:51:05.119 --> 00:51:06.240
and here's something that's been

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.440
bothering me let me know what you guys

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.720
think about this is

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.040
both sides in our country like right or

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.000
left

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.240
has zero accountability neither side

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.559
will accept any level of accountability

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:19.200
ever on anything yeah something bad can

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.040
happen to trump

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.680
and you i mean these these tweets and

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.040
all this [ __ ] are interchangeable it's

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.680
like when obama got elected they burned

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.160
him an effigy and all this [ __ ]

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.599
and that was in response to kathy

00:51:31.599 --> 00:51:33.520
griffin holding up trump's head

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.960
and then

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.960
like and you can just reverse that like

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.400
if a liberal was like this is cool and

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.640
it's trump's head somebody can be like

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.079
i don't know there's just no you're down

00:51:42.079 --> 00:51:43.599
in maryland there was a toilet set like

00:51:43.599 --> 00:51:44.880
you'd pee into the urinal and it was

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.400
just obama's mouth and you're just

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.160
peeing on obama's face

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.680
so it's like yeah there was that too

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.079
yeah and but

00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:54.079
that's not acceptable so if you're on

00:51:54.079 --> 00:51:55.920
the right you need to acknowledge that's

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.040
[ __ ] [ __ ] you're trying to think

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.319
of like but

00:51:58.319 --> 00:52:00.160
i've never found maryland i'm like i

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.240
think i peed like over his head i think

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.160
he's out of i don't respect i peed like

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.160
it's like i don't let it rain down

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.640
but yeah that is neither side of ever oh

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.559
no ever accept responsibility for

00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:11.760
anything that's going on well you

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.200
shouldn't ever there's no point for them

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:13.920
to

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.520
they they're every day like we're the

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.040
best we're the best no we're the best no

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.880
they did the best like now you did that

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.240
it's crazy i think you kind of got to be

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.839
dumb and no offense if you guys are like

00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:23.359
either staunch republicans or democrats

00:52:23.359 --> 00:52:24.559
i think you kind of got to be dumb to be

00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:26.400
like oh my through and through and it's

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.720
just like yeah for sure all right unless

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.079
you're just betting unless it's purely

00:52:30.079 --> 00:52:31.280
financial if you're like look whatever

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.480
makes me the most money i don't give

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:33.680
that that's what i you know yeah yeah

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:36.240
but at that point you could still have

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.359
different yeah

00:52:37.359 --> 00:52:38.880
right social

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.559
preferences

00:52:40.559 --> 00:52:42.400
like for example like

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.800
right now the media just destroys trump

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.319
like every single thing he does and then

00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:48.000
trump would come out or somebody would

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.200
come out and be like this is the most

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.119
scrutinized president of all time and

00:52:51.119 --> 00:52:52.559
then the left can be like did you see

00:52:52.559 --> 00:52:54.000
what you said about obama when he was

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
elected yeah yeah and it's like all

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.920
right maybe that was wrong

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.319
if that was wrong let's try to fix it

00:53:00.319 --> 00:53:01.440
well they'll be like well then why are

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.440
you fixing it now because yeah exactly

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.720
and it's both sides and it's always been

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.319
that way and it'll still be that way and

00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:08.319
it's uh but right now it seems to be

00:53:08.319 --> 00:53:10.800
much more

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.440
they're making it seem like so politics

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.680
now come down to race where it's like if

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.040
you're republican you're clearly a

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.960
racist like they're there's not like

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.640
yeah they've done the economy that you

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:21.520
know what i mean the people are thinking

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.200
about jobs and money and they're like no

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.599
it's about the kkk and [ __ ] racism

00:53:25.599 --> 00:53:27.440
and it's like dude that's like

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.119
it's about not people aren't [ __ ]

00:53:29.119 --> 00:53:30.640
most people are not thinking about that

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.160
they're trying to like

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.680
put their kids through school it's about

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.960
getting money and then just go to bed

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.040
and have about all at a high estimate

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.160
all 8 000 members of the kkk at a high

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.559
estimate 8 000. to put that in

00:53:42.559 --> 00:53:44.160
perspective more people will be at the

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.680
cumberland valley high school football

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.520

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.440
how crazy is that yeah that's what we're

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.440
worried about it's like these people

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.680
have no [ __ ] power

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.000
they are [ __ ] idiots the more we are

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
all [ __ ] afraid of them the more

00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.520
we're giving them a chance who was the

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.760
guy who got like real high up david duke

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.040
david duke used to be the head of the

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.640
clan what was his didn't he become like

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.800

what did he do i just know him he

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.319
probably had money and he ran for

00:54:10.319 --> 00:54:11.680
politics i think yeah yeah yeah he was

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.440
probably able to [ __ ] make a run yeah

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.520
a lot of racists have made runs as soon

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.200
as those guys hit the light it's like ah

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.960
[ __ ] david duke you're in the kkk bro

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.319
you can't have a job like that like get

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.480
he's weird trump has a weird tie to duke

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.920
that people like bro denounce him he was

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.160
like no no trump trump had a weird tie

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.480
to him because at first

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.880
david duke came out and endorsed him

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.640
yeah and this was during the campaign

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.000
and someone was like

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.200
what do you think about david duke and

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.559
trump kind of was just like i don't

00:54:44.559 --> 00:54:46.240
[ __ ] know about david duke i don't

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.839

00:54:47.839 --> 00:54:49.680
okay people were like he's a [ __ ]

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.119
klansman

00:54:51.119 --> 00:54:52.800
damn there's a lot of [ __ ] there's a

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.520
ton of fake news back and forth

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.839
and uh yeah i think dude imagine if he

00:54:57.839 --> 00:55:00.079
secretly was in the ku klux klan it's

00:55:00.079 --> 00:55:01.760
like like there's really a way that

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.599
that's his goal i was saying to run that

00:55:03.599 --> 00:55:05.359
through your head to be like at night he

00:55:05.359 --> 00:55:07.520
gets home sits down like slips the hood

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.920
on he's like another day he's done yeah

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.760
yeah that's [ __ ] wild that's probably

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.200
what a lot of people think

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.200
yeah i mean it was it was no it's not on

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.559
some level it's like a cover of the

00:55:16.559 --> 00:55:17.839
[ __ ] new yeah it's like a tiny

00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:19.440
burning cross you keep secret and it's

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.520
like it's on the cover of the [ __ ]

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.599
on the new yorker it was a [ __ ] image

00:55:23.599 --> 00:55:25.359
of donald trump in a sailboat and the

00:55:25.359 --> 00:55:26.880
sail was made out of the hood of a clan

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:27.920
that's what it was supposed to be he was

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.160
blowing it wow yeah i mean there's a

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:33.200
huge [ __ ] push to make

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.839
the current president a klansman

00:55:35.839 --> 00:55:37.200
that's what we're supposed to equate him

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.359
as and i i can't do it it's kind of

00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:41.280
ingenious so if that was someone's

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.240
[ __ ]

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.920
invention like if hillary clinton was

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.280
like yeah you think you beat me watch

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.760
this that's [ __ ] ingenious i mean it

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.160
is the democrats yeah there's i mean

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.680
also it's him

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.160
let's not forget he's clearly [ __ ] up

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.119
almost 24 7. but it's also the left

00:55:57.119 --> 00:55:58.240
that's

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.440
exacerbating every mistake he makes

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.280
constantly i mean it's something the

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.720
entire country

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:05.520
is

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.760
all right so he's [ __ ] up and then

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.359
the rest of the country is pushing him

00:56:09.359 --> 00:56:10.480
to [ __ ] up

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.319
what do you mean

00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:14.240
exactly what i said so he's [ __ ] up

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.520
almost daily yeah as a president yeah

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.720
and then the rest of the country the

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.240
media everyone

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.880
is making it worse

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:26.000
by re by exaggerating his failures every

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.319
single day yeah yeah and it's and we're

00:56:28.319 --> 00:56:30.880
in this state of [ __ ] like

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.720
chaos right now as far as i'm concerned

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.960
it's not chaos but it seems that way

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.720
yeah i mean my day-to-day still fine you

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.720

00:56:56.319 --> 00:56:59.760
subject if you uh one pot like

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.480
what's what's that audible like

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.760
listen to uh them by john ronson yeah

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.480
he's a humorous journalist and that's

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.839
how he describes so he's british and he

00:57:09.839 --> 00:57:11.680
reads his own books and it's just it's

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.280
great but he does

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.200
the in them he goes and hangs out with

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.040
extremists and one of the guys this is

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.359
back in the day it was alex jones yeah

00:57:19.359 --> 00:57:21.200

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.640
heard of alex jones or whatever he's

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.400
like this guy he's describing him as he

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.400
is bombastic whatever claims that

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.880
there's this secret bilderberg meeting

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.720

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:51.680
they told the um cops to stand down in

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.680

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.000
talking to each other like holy [ __ ]

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.760
what happened and like

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.079
but so the crowd breaks out in this usa

01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:12.319
champ my friend's [ __ ] he's a big

01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:14.160
meat head [ __ ] he played defensive end

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.599
at west chester like he was a jack

01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:17.920
[ __ ] guy and uh he was like what the

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.599
[ __ ] happened and somebody was like

01:00:19.599 --> 01:00:21.760
osama's dead and he thought he yelled

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.680
obama's dead

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.960
and he was like

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.720
it's weird the whole crowd is happy but

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.559
and then he joined the chant was like

01:00:28.559 --> 01:00:31.119
usa yeah [ __ ] that guy

01:00:31.119 --> 01:00:34.559
oh that's so [ __ ] funny yeah

01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:36.559
finally we've come to our channel we got

01:00:36.559 --> 01:00:37.359
him

01:00:37.359 --> 01:00:39.920
holy [ __ ] dude yeah that's uh but no

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.599
that's exactly right i mean the whole

01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:43.280
thing of just

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.720
i think that's what annoys me the most

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.400
about the whole and like i end up

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.240
sounding like i'm a conservative like

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.520
i'm right

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.599
like i'm some alt-right [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:00:51.599 --> 01:00:54.400
because i hate what the left is doing

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.559
obviously i hate what the rights doing

01:00:56.559 --> 01:00:58.079
like even like i said during

01:00:58.079 --> 01:00:59.920
charlottesville when i was sitting there

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.160
i was i was watching the news

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.240
it was the day after our live podcast i

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.799

01:01:06.799 --> 01:01:09.040
like i mean oh dude i [ __ ] opened the

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.640

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.280
of we've both been kind of

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.359
tongue-in-cheek all right like jokingly

01:01:17.359 --> 01:01:19.520
like [ __ ] yeah dude trump's the man all

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.720
this [ __ ]

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.480

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.599
us you're a [ __ ] idiot but uh

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:27.599
i was watching the news and like

01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:29.440
i was seeing all that [ __ ] unfold and i

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:32.000
was just like holy [ __ ] yeah and then

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.440
and then trump was gonna give a speech

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.280
at three and i was just like before he

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.440
came out i was like he's gonna [ __ ] this

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.079
up he's definitely gonna [ __ ] this up i

01:01:40.079 --> 01:01:41.839
was like and i was honestly i was like

01:01:41.839 --> 01:01:43.920

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.559
get this [ __ ] right

01:01:48.559 --> 01:01:50.400
and of course he comes out

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.400
20 minutes late there's been like

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.119
it was a veteran's a va [ __ ] bill

01:01:55.119 --> 01:01:56.240
that he was passing that's what the

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.440
meeting was for

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.760
and like these five veterans were just

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.760
standing there for 20 minutes like real

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.839
awkwardly because the camera was live

01:02:03.839 --> 01:02:06.720
and then uh he comes out and he's like

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.200
he just he handled it like a [ __ ]

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.280
idiot he wasn't right that's what he is

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.720
he handled it like a [ __ ] morning he

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.720
didn't denounce white supremacy which

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.000
would have been the easiest thing in the

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.240
world to do yeah again

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.799
you're denouncing

01:02:20.799 --> 01:02:23.440
300 people yeah it's not a hard [ __ ]

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.559
cell

01:02:24.559 --> 01:02:26.400
but then uh

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.319
yeah anything he does it's just like god

01:02:28.319 --> 01:02:29.440
damn it dude

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.240
like please do well i was [ __ ] 70.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.440
please do well i want you to do well

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.200
i do and that's where i think this is

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.799
another thing i think a lot of people

01:02:38.799 --> 01:02:39.760
don't

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.920
you know have a very strong vested

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.079
interest in the president not doing well

01:02:44.079 --> 01:02:46.720
definitely and they want him to fail

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.280
every step of the way well if he fails i

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.520
mean then they can go like told you

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:52.559
straight away

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:54.640
the worst and it's just like

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.400
not even that at least the democrats can

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.040
be like told you yeah we're the best and

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.240
that's what's gonna happen and that's

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.520
what is happening i mean we're

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.920
witnessing a complete failure

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.440
even do you see him [ __ ] look at the

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.799
eclipse

01:03:06.799 --> 01:03:08.799
yeah damn it dude i was watching that

01:03:08.799 --> 01:03:12.000
live too i was like come on donald dude

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.680
get this right and he walks out without

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.200
glasses and stares at it and the whole

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.039
crowd laughs at them dude until jesus

01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:18.480
christ still like the

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.920
even it's like it's not even a complete

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.440
failure until like the like you go

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.280
outside like the grocery store shelves

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.039
are empty of course of course we're

01:03:25.039 --> 01:03:26.720
[ __ ] chilling the economy's doing

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.880
well apparently he keeps saying that and

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.200
i believe him i mean i know construction

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.160
is busy

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.079
good so i mean did he do that probably

01:03:34.079 --> 01:03:35.440
not but no it seems like he's

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.280
piggybacking off the end of the obama

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.400
president but it's still

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.760
he keeps it's funny that he keeps

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.359
reiterating that he's like

01:03:43.359 --> 01:03:45.920
unemployment jobs at an all-time low

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.799
yeah

01:03:46.799 --> 01:03:48.559
and it's like oh that had nothing to do

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:50.720
with you but all right that's good so

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.400
many jobs there's gonna be jobs many

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.359
things many things are going great

01:03:55.359 --> 01:03:57.039
yeah and just the one thing i wanted to

01:03:57.039 --> 01:03:58.480
say from because i don't know if you'll

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.000
use it from earlier but like this idea

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.680
of the democracy of what makes it really

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.240
good because i feel like this is the

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.079
classic point to just drill home so

01:04:06.079 --> 01:04:07.680
sorry if i'm being done you just haven't

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.720
said it but it's like democracy

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.960
is not about us electing the perfect uh

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.640
politician or putting in place the

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.480
perfect policy it's about us being able

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.960
to peacefully remove the bad ones

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.599
and that is like and it doesn't always

01:04:21.599 --> 01:04:24.240
get everybody what they want but it is

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.400
the way to make progress and we've made

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.640
enormous progress and every other road

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.079
leads to tyranny

01:04:30.079 --> 01:04:32.160
so if you if you're not a fan of trump

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.039
like

01:04:33.039 --> 01:04:34.640
all right

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.280
vote them out yeah and show why your

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.680
ideas are better ideas but don't

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.079
yeah don't lose to him right in a

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:43.599
[ __ ] debate

01:04:43.599 --> 01:04:46.079
or a campaign don't lose to him

01:04:46.079 --> 01:04:48.240
how do you lose to him

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.000
well you you

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.160
do exactly what you described earlier

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.920
just in reverse where it's like you

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.920
can't call a spade a spade yeah you

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.559
can't say islamic fundamentalism

01:04:58.559 --> 01:04:59.839
yeah and they really can't how about

01:04:59.839 --> 01:05:01.839
that i mean and here's here's exactly

01:05:01.839 --> 01:05:03.520
the thing that i've been complaining

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.720
about how

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.720
neither side i'll be like well this

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.880
happened or like both sides every single

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.160
time is like

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.520
it's like hey you're wrong and it's like

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.760
well this happened so how about when you

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.760
did it that's what it always is so like

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.880
with trump

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:20.799
not denouncing white supremacy within

01:05:20.799 --> 01:05:22.400
while the thing was taking place in

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.680
charlottesville

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.599
the democrats point to that and are like

01:05:25.599 --> 01:05:26.720
what the [ __ ]

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.440
but then it's like well uh

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.720
obama never

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:33.440
denounced islamic extreme like you know

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.599
he never denounced extremism in islam

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:37.920
for eight [ __ ] years yeah that's a

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.599
similar thing where people were like

01:05:39.599 --> 01:05:41.200
obama's a [ __ ] terrorist yesterday

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.200
and it's like okay so the right needs to

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.880
shut the [ __ ] up about that and the left

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.200
needs to shut the [ __ ] up about that or

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.280
they both need to admit it was wrong but

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.799
instead neither side will admit it and

01:05:50.799 --> 01:05:52.400
they'll just be like yeah but remember

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.160
when obama wouldn't denounce islamic

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.160
terrorism yeah and they'll be like yeah

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.599
well remember when trump wouldn't

01:05:57.599 --> 01:06:00.160
denounce the kkk i don't understand how

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.720
no one realizes or not no one but like a

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.720
lot of them don't realize like all right

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.559
say say i'm like a staunch [ __ ]

01:06:06.559 --> 01:06:07.760
conservative

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.880
it's like you also need liberal thinkers

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.720
otherwise the whole country turns into

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.319
like a mad max bunker with like barbed

01:06:14.319 --> 01:06:15.520
wire fences

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.799
you know what i mean and then if you're

01:06:16.799 --> 01:06:18.079
just if you're just super liberal and

01:06:18.079 --> 01:06:19.280
you run the country then there's no

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.359
borders everyone runs out of food no one

01:06:21.359 --> 01:06:22.640
did any of the [ __ ] math it's just

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.079
like yeah man come on in bro i was sick

01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:26.319
yeah like you need both sides so they

01:06:26.319 --> 01:06:27.680
should even have a pre the president

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.520
should be neither the president should

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.839
have to be like i i like both sides and

01:06:31.839 --> 01:06:33.920
here's my thing with both of that like

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.680
i'm staunch this it's like well no you

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.119
can't [ __ ] no

01:06:37.119 --> 01:06:38.559
you know what i mean it makes no sense

01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:40.079
to be like i pledge allegiance to this

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:42.400
one party and it's like yeah but like

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.680
you kind of need because it does suck

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:46.480
that we're down to two parties so it's

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.119
uh yeah that's right dude i i actually

01:06:49.119 --> 01:06:51.119
think i thought that too but then

01:06:51.119 --> 01:06:52.880
there's an argument that that's actually

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.480
a good thing because

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.400
if you have this more parliamentary

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.000
system which i don't know how they work

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.440
exactly but let's say you've got like

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.119
eight parties

01:07:01.119 --> 01:07:03.280
and what they have to do because nobody

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.680
will get a majority you have to

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.839
form a coalition so what you can do is

01:07:07.839 --> 01:07:09.200
have like one of those parties that has

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.359
like very very few represents very few

01:07:11.359 --> 01:07:14.799
of the people but yet who selects them

01:07:14.799 --> 01:07:17.119
to get them to get their votes

01:07:17.119 --> 01:07:18.720
um will then get in power so it's

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.000
basically like if you have the democrats

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.599
and republicans and they have to vie for

01:07:21.599 --> 01:07:24.160
like the green party this green party

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.839
suddenly has so much power even they

01:07:25.839 --> 01:07:28.079
represent very few people that's

01:07:28.079 --> 01:07:30.160
probably how we got to two parties yeah

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.760
is it probably was like the whigs and

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.079
the bull moose and the republicans

01:07:34.079 --> 01:07:35.599
and the democrats and all these crazy

01:07:35.599 --> 01:07:36.880
[ __ ] parties and then they all

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.839
finally eventually joined forces and

01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:41.760
we ended up with two yeah and the thing

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.760
is like those but the the good thing at

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.760
least is that if the democrats lose for

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.520
a significant period of time they will

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.119
change internally it'll you know kind of

01:07:49.119 --> 01:07:49.920
like

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.839
a different party yeah yeah yeah it

01:07:51.839 --> 01:07:53.920
improves right because of competition

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.039
yeah the republicans are doing that

01:07:55.039 --> 01:07:56.559
they're cool now there's a lot of like

01:07:56.559 --> 01:07:58.319
it's it's almost literally like mac

01:07:58.319 --> 01:07:59.839
versus pc

01:07:59.839 --> 01:08:01.920
like jersey like cool pc commercials

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.000
you're like guys [ __ ] stop

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.520
there's like a dude sitting there like

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.920
in like a blue gray background he's like

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.839
touching all these screens like yeah man

01:08:09.839 --> 01:08:11.680
i don't know what i hate more in a

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.880
politician

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.160
uh

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.119
like

01:08:15.119 --> 01:08:17.600
being super religious or being super

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.759
cool i'm not sure what i hate super cool

01:08:19.759 --> 01:08:22.239
definitely super cool is like

01:08:22.239 --> 01:08:24.319
ah they're both incredibly fake like

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:25.839
bill clinton hitting the sacks and the

01:08:25.839 --> 01:08:28.400
shades on like dude oh dude the

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.040
democrats so trying to be cool pisses me

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.279

social media [ __ ] they never liked a

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.960
politician i mean i've listened as a

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.920
possibility

bush was the best it's like i guess dude

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:23.600
what a push george bush has made as far

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.319
as likability dude he's so funny and

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.199
his pocket where he got shot and then he

01:09:43.199 --> 01:09:45.279

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:47.440
[ __ ] i mean that i mean that's that

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.880

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.799
be a good debate thing you gotta take

01:09:50.799 --> 01:09:54.159
one of the shoulder and there i do now

01:09:54.159 --> 01:09:55.920
or at least a dead arm

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.960
yeah nice

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.600
solid dead arm or like a ball tap

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.960
you hit the nuts and you gotta go in

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.560

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.280
damn it yeah

01:10:06.239 --> 01:10:08.080
yeah that's uh

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.480
what what a podcast dude what apocalypse

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.159
this is where are we at timeless now

01:10:12.159 --> 01:10:14.480
we're 15. we're an hour and 15. yeah bro

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.440
oh time's fine i know time's fine uh

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.440
what else do you know about steve steve

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.880
give us some other things you know no i

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.719
don't know uh can i just ask you guys

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.880
stuff and then like maybe you know if

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.880
you don't yeah yeah go ahead like for

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.239
the talk

01:10:28.239 --> 01:10:29.520
so one of the things about like

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.360
knowledge creation is like what are the

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.840
limits of it and the only limits are the

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.080
laws of physics this is like david

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.600
deutsch's big thing it's like if the

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.760
laws of physics permit it we can do it

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.280
given that we create the right knowledge

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.880
right doesn't guarantee that we will but

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.120
just that we can so i'm trying to figure

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.960
out a way of like doing that for the

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.360
talk where i'm like explain the talk

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.560
the talk is just supposed to be a

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.120
comedic way of distilling information so

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.560
steve has these you can check them out

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.640
on what stevegurban.com or steven

01:10:58.719 --> 01:11:02.640
uh steve gurban steve girvin g-e-r-b-e-n

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.040
dot com steve gerben and uh he's giving

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.560
talks i've seen them they're on youtube

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:07.600
you can check out his website they're

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.600
really funny and informative you gave

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.440
that immigration talk you gave the saudi

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.040
arabian talk

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.719
and i actually got some good criticism

01:11:14.719 --> 01:11:16.480
from david deutsch on the immigration

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.640
talk yeah which is dd hit you up yeah

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.320
yeah cause i i asked some questions

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.320
about this yeah the immigration talk i

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.520
would like to

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.679
it's like i'd like to hedge a few things

01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:27.120
but i don't know if like i can go ahead

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.560
and explain your original health and

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.199
what was the problem with it the pro so

01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:33.760
i think what i the big thing i wanted to

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.360
convey the piece of information i

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.880
thought was really interesting is that

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.360
allowing people to

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.800
so we always think of like goods

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.000
crossing borders but we don't think

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.159
about labor crossing borders as much

01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:47.840
and the thing is is that allowing people

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.400
to move and take a job is the fastest

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.840
most efficient effective way to pull

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.440
them out of poverty

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.040
and so then

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.360
that is something we don't factor in

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.560
right we

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.800
uh we give a lot of money to places like

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.560
haiti and it basically goes

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.159
[ __ ] to a large degree thanks to the

01:12:04.159 --> 01:12:05.920
clinton foundation right

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.600
but you can let them come and take jobs

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.120
now the question is like what happens

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.800
when they come and take jobs

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.199
and you know in the the talk is like

01:12:13.199 --> 01:12:14.080
very

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.480
you know pro like but i don't a couple

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.840
things i don't do i don't tell you how

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.760
many or what kind so it's like do you

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:23.120
want to let in the um you know like the

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.840
college grads or do you want to let in

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.600
you know the people without degrees and

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.440
this is like it's it's an easy thing for

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:30.640
me to give the talk and not have to

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.880
answer that question but

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.880
you have to answer that question yeah

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.880
you know what i mean um

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:38.719
and then the other thing is

01:12:38.719 --> 01:12:40.560
here's can i say something yeah when you

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.280
said pull them out of poverty

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.199
you're talking about the worker yes and

01:12:47.199 --> 01:12:49.440
from an american perspective

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.800
that's where i can see people having a

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.960
problem with that it's like because

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.679
why do i give a [ __ ] if a guatemalan has

01:12:55.679 --> 01:12:58.000
poverty we need to be focusing focusing

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.640
on american poverty sure that that would

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.960
be yeah and that i mean here's my

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.199
response simple response yeah definitely

01:13:05.199 --> 01:13:06.719
my response to that would be that

01:13:06.719 --> 01:13:09.040
there's certainly going to be setbacks

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.640
and it seems like

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.440
the

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.800
and some people would be very upset that

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.520
i said it seems like but that uh it

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.480
would

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.719
lower the wages of low-skilled high

01:13:18.719 --> 01:13:20.480
school dropouts in the u.s because

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.840
that's where the job competition is

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.040
going to come from

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.280
um but a common misconception about the

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.600
economy is that it's a fixed size and

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.400
that's what i talk about in the

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.679
beginning that it's like a basketball

01:13:29.679 --> 01:13:31.120
court where somebody comes in they've

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.800
taken your job but that's not

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.239
necessarily the case like when you bring

01:13:34.239 --> 01:13:36.640
more people into a society those are

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.640
people who need to eat food

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.800
rent houses you know all these things

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.040
that then in themselves create jobs yeah

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.960
so you take like women and you add them

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.560
to the workforce it's not like we're all

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.600
[ __ ]

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.600
yeah um but there are there are

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.679
trade-offs and this is what

01:13:51.679 --> 01:13:52.960
you know

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.760
i

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.400
the boys like that was a that's a topic

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.840
and i don't i don't want to walk back

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.880
too much

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.600
because it's just immigration is a tough

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.440
topic and i yeah

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.440
i but then you talked to david deutch

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.960
and you kind of changed your tune a

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.520
little bit i did i i think here if i had

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.520
to say my opinions on immigration now

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.560
would be this

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.600
kind of what i said earlier namely that

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.719
what

01:14:16.719 --> 01:14:18.000
no go ahead

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.159
i heard our roommate upstairs yell

01:14:20.159 --> 01:14:22.080
about a video game and it kind of

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.360
sounded like he was responding to what

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.560
you were saying like if i had to change

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.880
my mind on immigration i just heard holy

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.800
[ __ ]

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.320
uh again i don't know how much the hell

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.520
helpful is gonna be your listeners

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.320
because i don't know if they're gonna

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.719
watch [ __ ] our listeners okay um would

01:14:34.719 --> 01:14:37.199
be this is that again the the rising

01:14:37.199 --> 01:14:38.640
tide sort of

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.880
idea of like we can do better in the

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.719
world if we

01:14:42.719 --> 01:14:44.239
create more knowledge and so like i

01:14:44.239 --> 01:14:46.320
think that we should

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.159
preferentially pull the smartest people

01:14:48.159 --> 01:14:49.920
here and

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:50.960
you know

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.560
yeah it's it's a tough call to make

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.159
because again it's almost like grapes of

01:14:54.159 --> 01:14:55.040
wraps

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.159
people are getting pushed out and they

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:57.360
have nowhere to go and they're trying to

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.280
provide for their families yeah some

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:02.000
right um yeah some are bailing races

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:02.880
yeah

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:06.159
but but it's hard to say

01:15:06.159 --> 01:15:07.520
you can't come in it's just like it's

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.520
morally a hard thing but i think if you

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.000
had a pick you would pick

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.600
the best of the best which actually

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.400
sounds a lot like trump's current

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.480
it is trump's currency yeah so you're

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.159
gonna watch that and it's awesome he's

01:15:20.159 --> 01:15:21.760
got it

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.520
he's got a plan he's got like a point

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.640
system where it's like if you're a

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.719
college grad you get x amount of points

01:15:26.719 --> 01:15:28.320
huh there's like a point system to get

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.560
into it does so we want we basically

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.400
want all the worlds we want good people

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.239
we don't we want all the nerds we don't

01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:36.480
want the lads dude what

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.719
tech yeah we don't want the lads dude

01:15:38.719 --> 01:15:40.239
didn't they do a thing though well i

01:15:40.239 --> 01:15:41.520
guess that's that's different that's

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.960
like no we want the lads dude we want

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.239
the legal ads

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:46.719
true but i also i would i would still

01:15:46.719 --> 01:15:49.040
say that the the 11 million undocumented

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.520
immigrants like here that they do need a

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.080
path to citizenship yeah because it's

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.239
like if you got people working and

01:15:56.239 --> 01:15:58.480
they're contributing to the economy and

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.480
i mean like what what the [ __ ]

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.280
yeah

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.560
they're here they're working job they're

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.239
contributing the company the economy and

01:16:04.239 --> 01:16:05.760
then they got to worry that they are

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.199
definitely

01:16:07.199 --> 01:16:08.000
uh

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.159
contributing to comedy

01:16:10.159 --> 01:16:12.000
there's mad immigrants contributing

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.600
right now if you have shout out hassan

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.760
minaj your special sucked you [ __ ]

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.000
nah nevermind but if you

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.880
saw us on if you're uh

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.400
if you have a company though and it's

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.719
like you can either hire like

01:16:24.719 --> 01:16:26.239
take for say for instance like a white

01:16:26.239 --> 01:16:28.719
college kid yeah versus like a mexican

01:16:28.719 --> 01:16:29.920
yeah

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.000
nine times out of ten depending on the

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.679
job you're like give me this mexican

01:16:33.679 --> 01:16:35.120
dude he's like a white college kid if

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.640
you're like a restaurant just like

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.080
sitting there like it's [ __ ] sucks my

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.760
future

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.280
most time mexican dudes come in and

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.400
they're just like give me more time but

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.560
you would be good for the economy what

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.640
now your restaurant's running smoother

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.000
more people are likely to come in and

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.679
buy things yeah

01:16:49.679 --> 01:16:50.800
dude yeah but that's the other thing

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.640
it's like if you battle those it's like

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.760
how can you

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.040
get like if those dudes are going to get

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.320
in no one's trying to ban no one's

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.719
trying to ban all the mexicans those

01:16:58.719 --> 01:16:59.840
people trying to kick if they're like

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.440
you're undocumented get out there's a

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.880
lot of people yeah but there's enough

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.199
people to pick up that slack we're not

01:17:05.199 --> 01:17:07.760
going to lose

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:08.960
labor

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.880
over that i don't think i mean

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.480
you gave an example of alabama yeah

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:15.600
alabama i think i i think that would be

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.520
i think it would i think i think it

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:19.440
would not be good to the local economies

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.800
as much as people think because again

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.320
this idea that these are people that are

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.320
contributing to it yeah for sure take

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.159
half the people out you're in trouble

01:17:26.159 --> 01:17:27.280
but um

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.640
this is like one of those thoughts i

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.880
don't know you know you just push back

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.040
on immediately and i'm sure it's not

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.920
right but it's like part of me does

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:38.159
not so much like if we're worried about

01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:40.159
the wages the high school dropouts and i

01:17:40.159 --> 01:17:41.920
know they're americans which is where a

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.199
lot of people draw the line but it's

01:17:43.199 --> 01:17:46.080
like you are born in america you have

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.400
like which is a gift

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.000
and the biggest gift on the planet you

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.040
tell them to check their american

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.719
privilege well and it's like you speak

01:17:52.719 --> 01:17:54.080
the language and the cops aren't after

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:56.239
you and you can't outwork some guy that

01:17:56.239 --> 01:17:57.520
doesn't speak the language who's

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.000
literally be hunted by the guy yeah yeah

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.520
well it's actually like matt said i mean

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.199
there's a guy from guatemala that's got

01:18:03.199 --> 01:18:05.199
a [ __ ] family to feed right versus a

01:18:05.199 --> 01:18:07.679
guy like let's say me at community

01:18:07.679 --> 01:18:08.719
college

01:18:08.719 --> 01:18:09.920
and we're both working at the same

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.199
restaurant

01:18:11.199 --> 01:18:12.320
well dude

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.719
if you spent a week say you spent yeah

01:18:14.719 --> 01:18:16.560
just a week where you're like

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.640
you couldn't find food

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:20.159
and then you found a place that has all

01:18:20.159 --> 01:18:21.120
the food

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.679
you'd [ __ ] work so hard like if

01:18:23.679 --> 01:18:25.040
you've never if you're like there's

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.560
always food no matter what you're kind

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.920
of like man

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.000
whatever like there's food somewhere

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.440
you're gonna get it but like

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.640
don't have food for a while that's

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.040
[ __ ] probably scary as [ __ ] yeah so

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.480
you wake up every day hit the car wash

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.719
dude you're just like yup yup lunch is

01:18:38.719 --> 01:18:40.080
coming dude i'm gonna wash all these

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:43.440
nissans and then i'm gonna get a [ __ ]

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.600
[ __ ] hoe dude

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.280
cheesesteak dude can you imagine getting

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.520
a cheesesteak

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.199
coming from [ __ ] guatemala dude

01:18:51.199 --> 01:18:52.480
you're eating you were splitting

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.640
lunchables with your entire family yeah

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.400
just like [ __ ] the [ __ ] was falling

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.159
out of the sky making each one of those

01:18:58.159 --> 01:18:59.920
little cracker sandwiches for each

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.920
member of your family you get one out of

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.440
the lunch but that's my thing is you

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.280
can't [ __ ] fight that it's like

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:06.719
breaking up the fun stuff someone's like

01:19:06.719 --> 01:19:08.400
i'm gonna die if i don't get here people

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:09.920
are gonna get in there definitely so

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:10.880
it's like

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.719
just gotta not be a [ __ ] dude you gotta

01:19:12.719 --> 01:19:15.120
be like you said you have to just try to

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.360
outperform whoever's coming in at you

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.280
i'm worried that i like

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:21.520
without the context

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:22.400
of that

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.320
talk and i don't think they're going to

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.679
want to listen to it

01:19:25.679 --> 01:19:27.199
yeah they'll listen to some people well

01:19:27.199 --> 01:19:28.400
yeah it's good i'm telling you that

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.159
that's helpful for me like i'll listen

01:19:30.159 --> 01:19:31.679
to stuff like that and i'm like

01:19:31.679 --> 01:19:33.440
it's good to have someone put ideas like

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.800
something that complex in a way that i

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.960
can like hear then be like here's like

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.400
it's a bite-sized thing that i can

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.840
explain now okay you know what i mean so

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.520
i i like yeah i think i think a lot of

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.880
people like about i think your talks are

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.640
great i was hoping that this

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.320
conversation might spur you into

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.520
discussing

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.199
you know common

01:19:49.199 --> 01:19:52.080
current events right now like antifa and

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.000
the alt-right and all that stuff i think

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.199
it would be good to have somebody do

01:19:55.199 --> 01:19:57.120
research and talk about it

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:00.080
well with a rational [ __ ] i'm i'm

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.600
trying

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.120
yeah that would be good it'd be nice to

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.960
have somebody come out and not be full

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.679
[ __ ] like the left is right and the

01:20:07.679 --> 01:20:10.159
the alt-right are nazis it'd be nice to

01:20:10.159 --> 01:20:11.920
have somebody with the intelligence to

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.239
be like this is what it actually is yeah

01:20:14.239 --> 01:20:15.679
but dude the thing is is that that's and

01:20:15.679 --> 01:20:16.400
that's the whole thing you're saying

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.320
about the left they'll just go clearly a

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.560
nazi sympathizer as soon as you disagree

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:22.480
with them you can paint it out you can

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.760

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.120
it's like

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.719

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.679
immediately in checkmate you just have

01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:09.840
to be okay with it yeah yeah that's a

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.880
tough story

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:13.440
that's a tough weird spot dude i had

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.880
that this week so i had that going on

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.719
which i was just like whatever and it's

01:25:16.719 --> 01:25:19.440
the fact that he's a virgin is so weird

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.440
27 year old man

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:23.600
virgin was it a [ __ ] fraternity and

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.679
everything it's like dude how did you do

01:25:25.679 --> 01:25:26.639
that

01:25:26.639 --> 01:25:28.400
like if i don't jerk off for three days

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.800
my [ __ ] loins dude are just like

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.800
pulsing yeah it's like you were telling

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:36.480
me at 18 17 19 21 to all the way to like

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.840
24.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.440
you didn't you didn't come maybe come

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.199
across one thing because i saw him and

01:25:41.199 --> 01:25:42.880
it's not like he's like tremendously

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.560
overweight maybe he used to be like

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.639
obese i don't think so

01:25:46.639 --> 01:25:47.760
because other than that it's kind of

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.199
hard to get they told me about like high

01:25:49.199 --> 01:25:50.880
school stuff with them and i'm like dude

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.840
something's gonna come

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:56.000
up i don't know the mystery defense

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.920

you can get it from jiu-jitsu it's a

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:22.000
perfectly circular rash a lot of

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.280

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.440
yeah so i've got it before like all my

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.120

dick a tiny ring worm on my dick

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:30.880
dude

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:32.320
yes right dude i had to like seriously

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.840
figure out how to get rid of this

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.280
did you think you got it do you think

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.880
you got it from your wax

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:38.320
that's dude that's the question do you

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.159
think it could be your wax and i wanted

01:26:40.159 --> 01:26:42.159
to bring this up to my listeners dude

01:26:42.159 --> 01:26:44.800
if you've been on a heavy dunk

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.719
no no no famous dong that's what i

01:26:46.719 --> 01:26:47.840
thought

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.000
dude like steve jobs same thing like you

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.080
know he had a couple failures so i think

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.239
from keeping my dick constantly moist it

01:26:54.239 --> 01:26:56.639
may have for sure it may have been

01:26:56.639 --> 01:26:58.880
rubbing oil on your dick for a month

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.880
every day how great is that

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.239
how sick would it be if you made a

01:27:02.239 --> 01:27:04.000
commercial like a [ __ ] pharmaceutical

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.320
commercial for your world famous don wax

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.840
then it just ends with like side effects

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:08.800
may include

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.400
ringworm

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.840
but here's the thing dude that's a big

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.520
side effect i think it goes deeper than

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.440
the wax that's my problem

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.800
i think that's

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.880
it you need more it's not that i was

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:19.760
wrong

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.440
you need more because you need to double

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.880
down i didn't even get i didn't get into

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.800
this so i was so i was so [ __ ] up

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:27.679
about my weird [ __ ] ringworm it's a

01:27:27.679 --> 01:27:29.199
tiny little thing it's barely noticeable

01:27:29.199 --> 01:27:30.480
but i know it's ringworm i got it once

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.400
before and then i have this dude sniff

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.520
around so like i can't even we can't

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.440

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.520
scoop to come out dude just in my head

so we couldn't even have sex

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.040
so i went to i try to go tanning because

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.960
i read that sunlight will just crush

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.960
this [ __ ] so you had your dick out in a

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.639
sunbed

01:27:53.679 --> 01:27:55.920
i had a [ __ ] skin disorder that

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.000
required sunlight and it was it was

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.159

01:28:00.159 --> 01:28:01.199
salon

01:28:01.199 --> 01:28:02.880
it's so humiliating i'd rather walk into

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.159
a whorehouse

01:28:04.159 --> 01:28:06.560
dude it was so bad dude so i walk up i

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.480

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.080
thank god two people see me there i'm

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.600

about me being entertaining

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.760

01:28:41.679 --> 01:28:43.040
to lancaster avenue i came to a red

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:44.320
light i'd throw my shirt over it and

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.080
then as soon as i hit the gas dude shirt

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.600
was up the [ __ ] bird was [ __ ]

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.920
tanning so the thing is is like i want

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.840
to start a whole camp dude

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.840
it's over the wax is just a part of it

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:56.400
the wax works

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.120
i'm starting a dick retreat dude you go

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.719
out you just tan your [ __ ] dog you

01:29:00.719 --> 01:29:02.800
want to make tanning beds for dicks no

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.679
it's like

01:29:03.679 --> 01:29:05.440
no but just solar energy just a nice

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.440
tanning bed just for your dog just like

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.679
a pocket [ __ ] solar

01:29:09.679 --> 01:29:11.199
solar pocket [ __ ] that you put over

01:29:11.199 --> 01:29:13.440
here that's a billion dollar idea just

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.960
like that matt and shane's podcast is

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.080
officially done we're done with the

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:18.239
podcast we're on to making solar beds

01:29:18.239 --> 01:29:20.000
for dicks i want a dick retreat dude you

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
wake up you jell you son it out you're

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.520
back to back with your dudes so no one's

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.440
looking at anyone's dong and then you

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.320
wax and you go to bed so like a straight

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.719
just a domino or john retreat dude the

01:29:30.719 --> 01:29:32.480
dong retreat it's oh i've told you it's

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:34.719
bigger than the wax the wax showed me

01:29:34.719 --> 01:29:36.320
like dude there's more to this

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.960
there's gotta

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:42.080
i would imagine though that dick health

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:44.880
has been probably the most studied

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.600
it's not though i bet it is throughout

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.600
ancient history like i bet every culture

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.280
was like

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:54.159
yeah our dick yeah but no one's stuck no

01:29:54.159 --> 01:29:56.239
one does like dick exercises i think his

01:29:56.239 --> 01:29:57.679
dick so you can just you can go work out

01:29:57.679 --> 01:29:59.280
all day long on your arms like yeah i do

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.800
exercises of strength in my dick people

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:02.159
were like what the [ __ ] wrong with you

01:30:02.159 --> 01:30:04.320
well that makes perfect sense why

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:05.760
because i don't think there are muscles

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.239
like this you can strengthen the [ __ ]

01:30:08.239 --> 01:30:10.080
the capillaries and stuff if you're

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:11.520
constantly putting that under stress

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.679
your body's going to respond

01:30:13.679 --> 01:30:14.880
so you're like we know all this stuff we

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.400
know about dicks dude

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:17.840
right it's joking you can do you can

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:21.199
stretch it you can [ __ ] sunbathe it

01:30:21.199 --> 01:30:23.199
you gotta [ __ ] sunbathe your hog dude

01:30:23.199 --> 01:30:24.960
that's my new thing i'm i'm off the

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:26.960
[ __ ] wax for now no more wax i'm

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.880
catching rays in my car when i if i hit

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.239
sunlight i'm like

01:30:30.239 --> 01:30:31.840
next next week

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.679
matt's definitely gonna be getting

01:30:33.679 --> 01:30:36.639
bailed out of jail for a decent exposure

01:30:36.639 --> 01:30:38.639
dude but you it is [ __ ] pretty scary

01:30:38.639 --> 01:30:40.400
like anyone in an suv can definitely see

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.800
your dick i was driving by other cars

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.480
seeing like if i could see their dick if

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.159
it was out it's like

01:30:46.159 --> 01:30:48.000
you can't see dicks you can't unless

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.199
someone's in it

01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:51.040
yeah or an suv and even then that's

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:52.639
tough because of the roof or somebody

01:30:52.639 --> 01:30:53.920
like you get a lot of jaywalkers on

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:55.280
lancaster avenue so if someone's

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.880
jaywalking you gotta dude and it's so

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:58.719
hard to drive and not look at your deck

01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:02.320
while you're driving so i was like

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.840
so that was my weekend in a nutshell

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.520
dude

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:07.440
i was battling black nerds i was trying

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.040
to sunbathe my dick dude so i get hot

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.239
back in the game

01:31:10.239 --> 01:31:12.639
you gotta get rid of that ring worm

01:31:12.639 --> 01:31:14.400
it's almost

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:17.120
locherman sunbathing yeah thank you

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.040
that's the new regimen right now

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.320
that's when you get ringworm anywhere

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.320
dude and my dick i i'm [ __ ] sweaty

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.760
all day i work i go outside and it's

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:25.920
like your dicks get wet dude and yeah

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.600
you chuckle in the wax maybe that throw

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.120
some wax in there

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.120
maybe i'm not sure yet there's coconut

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:33.440
oil on that already sweaty dick

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:35.440
there's gonna be some fungal growth yeah

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.040
i mean [ __ ] so

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.679
i have a what do you think i had a

01:31:39.679 --> 01:31:40.639
product

01:31:40.639 --> 01:31:42.639
that might go along with your like your

01:31:42.639 --> 01:31:44.159
dick retreat it was i mean it's dick

01:31:44.159 --> 01:31:47.120
related uh it was my idea was that you

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.480
would take um

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.719
like a vaginal tightening

01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:51.760
like a

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:54.000
face yeah and then you'd coat the

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.120
outside of the condom with it and so the

01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:59.040
yes it would instead of you worry about

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:00.400
making your penis bigger it would make

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.719
her vagina tighter yeah why don't they

01:32:02.719 --> 01:32:03.840
do that

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.600
that's [ __ ] that's what david deutsch

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.040
[ __ ] problem solving right that's

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.440
dude that's that's thinking about it

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.480
was gonna be called make him feel bigger

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:13.920

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.040
to have it he talks about yeah we've had

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.480
this conversation and i was wondering
