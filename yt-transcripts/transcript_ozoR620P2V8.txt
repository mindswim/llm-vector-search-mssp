00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.160
do yes that's a big difference I've

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.920
encountered between black communities

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.990
and Latino communities like if I do

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.520
something like that in like a black

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.190
community which I've obviously lived in

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.880
my whole life

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.760
that's like hell yeah do you know I mean

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.310
that's that's instant papi status oh you

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.430
play too much etc and you see that like

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.990
they don't they don't catch white boy

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.100
humor like ironic white boy you know

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.680
ingratiating humor like that there's not

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.450
a lot of there's not a lot of like

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.520
busting chops in that community period

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.890
yeah very prideful everything goes to a

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:48.890
fight a lot of passion today I was

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.810
sensitive to much of it there's what

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.820
they probably sends it on me also when I

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.650
wear walk around my neighborhood wearing

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.089
a flannel shirt I look like a serial

00:09:56.089 --> 00:09:59.060
killer either like a very bad like

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.190
plainclothes police officer or serial

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.870
killer so it's like well in prison

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.670
apparently I think it I don't know if

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.350
it's still the case but well I can only

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.520
speak for the California prison system

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.750
because that's the only youtubers i

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.250

roll together in prison in terms of

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.480
number I thought it was like it depends

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.520
it could be especially there's an

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.650
alliance in the California state prison

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.780

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.600
like he almost sounds like a [ __ ]

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.820
Philly dork like wicker with a towel

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.709

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.019

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.709
his whole story

00:11:51.709 --> 00:11:53.899
then he did a clickbait video that was

00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:56.089
[ __ ] West Watson as a fraud so I was

00:11:56.089 --> 00:11:57.800
obviously like I I was doing a full

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.060
investigation like trying to fight

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.380
figure out if he was a fraud or not

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.950
because there's an old there's a old

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.140
homie who's like in if there's another

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.149
guy who's fully investigating West

00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:09.680
Watson trying to take him out based on

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.920
the prison riot he reported on he met

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.390
with a homie that was in the prison riot

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.640
was like yeah Watson was not in it so

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.250

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.190
track somebody in a riot yeah well he

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:23.570
was trying to say the white boys were

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.950
not in the riot at all it was between

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.750

00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:42.279
wearing like a video him wearing

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:44.049
blackface and he wasn't like talking he

00:16:44.049 --> 00:16:49.269
was just like showing like yep I mean he

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:52.179
you did it too many times can I like no

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:54.699

00:16:54.699 --> 00:17:01.360
excuse dopey [ __ ] I'm gonna stop no it

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.850
was he was saying he was like I realized

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.250
it too you know my my you could call it

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:15.699
a habit at this point due to his

00:17:15.699 --> 00:17:18.730
privilege so he's claiming he was so

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.120
rich he didn't know he was like you

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.130
don't understand we were so [ __ ] rich

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.809
so funny because it's only like super

00:17:25.809 --> 00:17:28.690
rich like privileged teens you see that

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.019
even have the idea to do blackface yeah

00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:34.090
like I don't remember ever encountering

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.620
a kid that was like I think we do

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.809
blackface it's also funny too

00:17:40.809 --> 00:17:42.429
like I remember when I was younger you

00:17:42.429 --> 00:17:45.519
were either like a skateboarder a thug

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:46.360
and there was all these different

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.919
cliques and if you were like super rich

00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:52.169
you're just like I guess I'll go buy

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.350
like I don't know you like when we were

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.210
like kids like the the wicker kids were

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.470
like the coolest like if you have been a

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.299
shitty white a red like the winger kids

00:18:01.299 --> 00:18:02.710
that were just like doing a bad

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.450
impression of the [ __ ] they saw that was

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.100
like the coolest kid yeah so these rich

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.210
kids was like I'm gonna do this the

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:17.110
right yeah man he claimed he was so rich

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.749
that he was like he's like I blame it on

00:18:19.749 --> 00:18:21.309
my privilege like I obviously I know

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:26.080
blackface is wrong look we know they try

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.059
to down great at the brown face he was

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:29.649
like that was some [ __ ] because

00:18:29.649 --> 00:18:32.320
around freeze incidents was literally

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.289
black marker well here's here's two

00:18:35.289 --> 00:18:39.009
things one almost 99% of the time a

00:18:39.009 --> 00:18:41.200
white person in blackface is hilarious

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:47.860
to visually dancer something isn't

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.529
tap-dancing the issue stammel hogging

00:18:50.529 --> 00:19:01.539
all the good acting roles I think they

00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:03.789
cancel the role and dress up as the guys

00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:12.159
that applied for it but it has to be see

00:19:12.159 --> 00:19:14.740
the reason I I agree over the term brown

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.749
face yes brown face yeah because it's

00:19:16.749 --> 00:19:20.190
like he's he was mocking

00:19:20.249 --> 00:19:25.749
sure that's not blocking Indians I mean

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:26.919
when you're brown face first of all

00:19:26.919 --> 00:19:30.340
isn't it Middle Eastern photo Aladdin

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.110
was a fake Middle Eastern thing true

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.029
yeah Rabia news Arabian Nights yeah it's

00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:40.090
not Indians dude I mean if you assert

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.779
the apology now

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.000
a high population of Sikhs they live in

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.770
India who claim the nationality of India

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.060
because there in India that wasn't a

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.310
seat casinos let's do you see costume I

00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:05.250
mean I mean it's turban so now see dress

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:06.630
a little more plain that was actually

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:12.890
how they fish that was Sultan garb

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.810
Sikhs rock just like altar boy costumes

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.190
always carry a knife it's by religion

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.570
before they punch you the jewel in their

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:27.240
turban flashes it's their religious duty

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.560
to carry a knife and protect the

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:28.950
innocent

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.740
yeah at all you see a dude with a turban

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.630
yeah they have a knife on them that

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.370
they're religiously required to eat

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:35.850
wield

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.920
in case someone's [ __ ] with people

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.480
and they'll dagger the flock out of you

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.490
they have [ __ ] officer just Indian

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.570
Arabia moist I'll [ __ ] with Sikhs Fe

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.000
first of all I'm still thinking about

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.010
the acting gigs back then so if you're

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.930
like in 1920s black dude you were just

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.580
in the audition room next to a dude in

00:20:53.580 --> 00:21:05.520
black New York I walked in so if you

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.630
don't know what I look like I'm just a

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.190
white guy with a beard and a nice

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:15.360
haircut and I walk into they didn't have

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.120
chairs it was like locker room benches

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.860
with the paint chipping off in like

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.070
midtown Manhattan and it was just like

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.900
15 dudes that looked like a handsome or

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.660
me so I felt I felt like they were doing

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.550
like I felt like the black you know I

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:35.520
was basically you lost privilege yeah so

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.260
what'd you do I [ __ ] nailed it dude

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.030
actually yeah god I got it

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.190

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.870
mean you can't do you can't do Tim face

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.850
it nobody can dude nobody can you can't

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.470
see Tim face so they gave it to the real

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:51.210
one dude I'm so [ __ ] saying I

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.070
empathize with your [ __ ] boys with a

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.950
dude on the bench on 1920s yeah this is

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.750
[ __ ] [ __ ] what are you guys out

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.010
there doing with your privilege though

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.720
me call this privilege that you guys

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.030
have

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:05.020
whose [ __ ] blackface any more [ __ ]

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.390
level I think I call my mom was like mom

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:14.740
delete the [ __ ] photos I don't think

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.810
I have a picture in a yearbook that you

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.250
could find that would be as cool as me

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:22.420
just doing what was funny as I was

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.890
picking out costumes with Brittany and

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.630
she was like we should be Native

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.780
Americans sounds like I don't think I

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.790
can do it I don't the I'm allowed to go

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.320
come on that's when I hit her with like

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.880
I'll be black panther's I get the [ __ ]

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.200
out of here not being Black Panther

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.040
that'd be awesome

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.750
I was like what the [ __ ] is oh you can't

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:38.500
do it was like she said I should

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.960
literally be an Arabian no no an

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.610
Egyptian pharaoh I was like I don't

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:43.900
think I want to do that is she just

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.560
trying to push me up she's tricking you

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.300
just put this icy hot on your costume I

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:54.010
mean yeah I do explain they're like I

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.180
can't be a Native American

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.140
she's like you could be a native I'm

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.940
like no no I literally can't do that

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.330
right now

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.700
they might be easily they might be like

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.160
gold medal privilege Olympics right now

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.920
Native American yeah still people don't

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.470
really give a [ __ ] well obviously no one

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.400
gives I mean no because it [ __ ] about

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.960
any of it like people literally just

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.730
took their land again

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.410
and everyone's like yeah yeah that sucks

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.570
well I think I took they built a

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.610
pipeline on their land again

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:19.990
everything's like you know what's funny

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.930
as I think this is probably just me but

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.370
if you probably just justify cuz it ball

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.720
I mean there's nothing many of them left

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.760
they don't need a lot like they're dying

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.300
off

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.740
I think you'd imagine being the guy

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.570
who's got to sell the pipeline he's like

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:35.110
here's cotton through a reservation we

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:39.220
pay them good he's actually talking

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.600
through a megaphone out of the top of a

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:48.850
tank you got casinos we're adding oil to

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.220
your portfolio just [ __ ] get out of

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.110
the way yeah dude that's well that's the

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.700
thing with reparations people freaky

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.170
they're like that's [ __ ] but it's

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:57.850
like dude we gave the Native Americans

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.220
hard reparations but you have to

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.790
recognize tribe status so it's like we

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.320
gave the Native Americans hard

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.900
reparations I thought so it's like I've

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.960
never heard it put that way yeah I don't

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.090
think I've ever heard what they were

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.080
given

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.820
in like a positive light I think it was

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.210
always like definitely not enough yeah

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.380
it depends on which side you're looking

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.210
at it from right well I don't care I got

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.039
from hearing it likes I mean it's

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:27.669
negative

00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:28.899
you got your you're not allowed to

00:24:28.899 --> 00:24:31.210
practice your identity anymore but

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.370
you're paid if you're in a try it's like

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.909
Oh calm down with all that silly [ __ ] I

00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:39.220
guess I did never question the fact that

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.080
they still like wrap themselves in

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.390
blankets and lived that way whenever you

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.100
see one like you know TV or whatever

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.919
some do somewhat it's like the Amish is

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:49.240
like that's an expensive lifestyle keep

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.789
up if you're not forced to uh you know

00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:54.399
what go to an office every day true I

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:56.230
mean well I was actually thinking I

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.460
think all white people should just live

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.519
off the grid that means take solution

00:25:00.519 --> 00:25:03.269
that wouldn't be on a new grid exactly

00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:06.130
yeah some white person would invent the

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:15.029
grid the post office we have REI Oh

00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:17.260
metropole and it's all white chick in a

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.720
poncho on a Vespa and I was like damn

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.260
dude we should all go off the grid

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.399
poncho uh there are people doing that

00:25:24.399 --> 00:25:26.529
there uh front there's frontiers people

00:25:26.529 --> 00:25:27.909
there's this guy I think it seems like

00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:30.610
winter something on YouTube and like

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.350
people just live in like northern Canada

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:33.789
like off the grid they build their homes

00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:36.159
like yeah that's what I'm saying

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:38.230
that'd be a winter star something like

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.299
that but the jack dude now this guy

00:25:40.299 --> 00:25:42.070
looks like Ray Romano that would be a

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.429
sick I think it'd be tight if it doesn't

00:25:45.429 --> 00:25:46.570
really solve anything it makes no sense

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:48.010
with like alright white people going off

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:51.100
the grid just for like 10 years and just

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.230
tribe DUP lived off me there's a youtube

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.240
community built around it really yeah at

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.679
one point he was watching see I love uh

00:25:56.679 --> 00:25:58.779
I love finding videos of people shutting

00:25:58.779 --> 00:26:02.080
the other channels so I love watching

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.760
like youtubers shut then like but so

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.889
when when a Bitcoin like took a [ __ ] a

00:26:05.889 --> 00:26:07.240
little while back there was a bunch of

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.230
channels were like we're shutting down

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.510
the Bitcoin farm and it just dudes

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.340
crying in empty warehouses anyway the

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.630
reason I found this dude because he was

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.610
like I'm gonna stop making videos for a

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.529
while there have been some comments

00:26:17.529 --> 00:26:19.809
about the state of my homestead and I I

00:26:19.809 --> 00:26:21.789
feel like I'm not doing the job I should

00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:24.060
be maintaining my property and

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.950
yeah like he was taking time off to fix

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.630
his barn and his tools and she went dark

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:35.310
yeah man what are you so you so other

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.070
than like hiding from the minorities in

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:44.280
the woods it would just be like I mean

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.020
it'd be a total oh yeah it'll be a sick

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.900
move because there's no thing you can

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.950

calls so I can't [ __ ] say yeah hey

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.110
I'm [ __ ] help you but it's a little

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.570
it's like you're allowed to admit that

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.460
but like you're not nobody's allowed to

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.130
acknowledge that a black person is down

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:50.190
low right so it's like so no he he

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.600
always brings up this old joke this old

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:18.350
are you

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:35.130
let's be on a book and they're like wow

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.679
so I mean it's the equivalent say it's

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:40.380
like in a racist way right cuz that's

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:53.669
not true like I mean I guess I'm wait so

00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:55.440
and then what do people say typically

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.640
they're like don't say that

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.929
yeah basically if they'd done it

00:28:57.929 --> 00:29:01.470
defended yeah I don't I know that joke

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.150
I'm not going to give that depending how

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:06.120
do you know no I'm saying it today my

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.110
big well how do you know that yeah yeah

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.150
I wasn't about to say that you [ __ ]

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:09.720
[ __ ]

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.640
yeah so what do you so how does that

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.020
translate to white people being not

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.970
hiding but living peacefully off the

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.740
grid definitely I'm not saying anyone

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.240
else can't join off the grid I'm saying

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.530
it would be nice and white people to go

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.030
where are you gonna hide a society if

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:30.179
you want way too much Wes Watson where

00:29:30.179 --> 00:29:32.880

hydrants

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.559

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:39.809
away by themselves for camping forever

00:29:39.809 --> 00:29:42.840

00:29:46.679 --> 00:29:48.360
like walking around a fire like old

lot of black deer hunters huh they would

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:40.559

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:06.570
a demon taking your kids Weiss and he's

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:10.770
like that's a [ __ ] buyers said you do

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:13.290
black people have like a complicated

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:14.940
relationship with ghosts since it's

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.500
always ghosts versus white people and

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.970
horrible yeah superstitious people

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.470
clearly afraid of ghosts in real life

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:25.200
very afraid but like when it's it's like

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.150
when Godzilla turns on the like the

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.830
bigger monster it's like hell yeah now I

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.630
root for Godzilla I'm sorry yeah you

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:32.130
smashed everything but now we need you

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:35.850
to win true yeah I mean I I don't

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:37.770
personally but most of the black do I

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.330
know [ __ ] with horror movies heavy I

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:40.740
said I was saying I was thinking maybe

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.990
like you know yeah moving to the [ __ ]

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.320
woods

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.790
maybe there's a subconscious thing there

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.800
watching final destination it's just

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.360
[ __ ] a little slight people get their

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.910
heads cut off and rollercoaster I will

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.730
say this every time I ask my sister what

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:56.130
a movie was about I swear to god she's

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.080
always like okay so this white boy was

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:07.050
about to get on a plane like this way oh

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:10.140
yeah oh yeah oh harsher yeah so I

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.000
definitely rooting for it you know she's

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.440
definitely out there we laughed at a

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:22.020
point that I was like get out do that

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.500
understand though that that is what they

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.480
like is the first representation of what

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.770
white people are like when you're in the

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.870
hood it's the movies that you like so if

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.460
you like horror movies you grow up

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.050
constantly thinking that white people

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:35.940
never stop doing dumb [ __ ] in emergency

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.280
situations it's like the Dumber it's

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.020
like the Dumber the idea the more likely

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.940
the way person is relevant you know so

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:44.100
yes so he's like seeing that and he's

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.360
just seeing white people just confirming

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:52.050
his bias true that was my weekend I was

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.690
watching a conjuring just kind of being

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:54.930
like

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:57.710
you guys think this is funny huh

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.170
she's based on a [ __ ] true story yeah

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:02.609
how about we put on boys in the hood and

00:35:02.609 --> 00:35:09.210

00:35:31.859 --> 00:35:33.510
watched my entire life why and the

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.890
second time I watched it I had like a

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.390
physical reaction I wanted to take

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.359
myself to the hospital yeah well first

00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:42.299

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.920
swelling everywhere and they're

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.990

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.119
hospital I wanted to think myself the

00:36:06.119 --> 00:36:07.500
hospital why'd you want cuz the first

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.490
time I saw I went to the movies with

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:10.950
rainy and we saw it and I was like man

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:12.510
that was really good and it was just

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.859
like miserable the whole movies so

00:36:13.859 --> 00:36:15.839
[ __ ] miserable but I really liked the

00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:18.329
ending yeah and it was like to me it was

00:36:18.329 --> 00:36:19.859
like kind of poetic and beautiful and

00:36:19.859 --> 00:36:21.950
you know of course big deal about it but

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.030
a fun game it is I mean it cuz you know

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.860
a little to her knowledge I've been high

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.770

yeah I get utility high before I even do

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:35.460

you're talking about yeah like a field

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.820
medic yeah just to deal with this [ __ ]

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.110
I had a key for all her when I took my

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:46.350
two older kids to see Toy Story 4 oh not

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.300
only I was watching I was like this

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.430
might be the best movie ever made I like

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:51.480
in the moment I was like this is the

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.370
this is gonna be the best memory of my

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:54.060
entire life

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:58.710
I can't believe cuz like we're the

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:00.240
perfect agent when Toy Story one came

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.800
out we're like this is cinematic

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.840
breakthrough the marvel of Technology

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.980
it's and it was like a [ __ ]

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.170
sentimental movie and I was like I've

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.900
got my [ __ ] tween children here

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.840
seeing the like the the conclusion of

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:18.870
all oh my god dude this is even think

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.130
about it right now I could cry how'd

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:23.160
they like it really oh well first of all

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.300
they don't even know that like sequels

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.060
are bad but Toy Story 4 [ __ ] ruled

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.850
yeah and they were way into it like

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:31.440
walking back to the car like when you

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.820
get out movie theater and the Sun hit T

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.670
again oh I thought I was gonna ascend

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:37.530
right there the golden hour dude yeah

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:40.170
damn is it weird being stone around her

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:41.940
kids never that's awesome

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.710
I was wondering about that yeah it makes

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:45.240
you a better parent I would say so I

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:50.100
think I said that funny thing is so you

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.720
know when you're when your child's born

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.520
I always tell you yeah the man you also

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.110
have a physiological reaction like when

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.640
you see your child for the first time

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.750
you need to hold it for the first time

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:00.330
and it's true I mean I think I can for

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:01.950
me were you there for the birth of your

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:02.460
kids

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:07.020
Arthur gonna say for your kids no you

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.000
probably felt it [ __ ] you don't I'm

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.740
saying it's awesome it's an amazing it's

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.440
an otherworldly experience right and I

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.330
remember afterwards like right after

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:17.070
experiencing that I put him on the man

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.480
that I've been sick

00:39:22.299 --> 00:39:25.700

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.789

00:39:34.009 --> 00:39:36.170
telling myself like gotta get high for

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:39.859
this one sure it's perfect

00:39:39.859 --> 00:39:44.539
we're going in we have a time you know

00:39:44.539 --> 00:39:45.859
what I mean it's gonna be quit did you

00:39:45.859 --> 00:39:48.319
uh stop about why they do c-sections so

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:52.339
you can get you stopped the doctor on

00:39:52.339 --> 00:39:53.690
his way out like his band just played

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:56.660

oh my god dude how was the section I was

00:40:14.239 --> 00:40:20.450
pretty well it was pretty well it was

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.069
like the cutting muscle when [ __ ] like I

00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:23.329
mean I don't know my wife was Jack I

00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:25.460

time yeah and had to get cut out and

00:40:37.039 --> 00:40:40.940
like I watched that surgery happen and

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.769
like pour acid on it at one point really

00:40:42.769 --> 00:40:45.349
yeah because you have to kill the area

00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:47.420
where it was ingrown so it doesn't

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:47.960
happen again

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.269
so you dead you dead in that and like

00:40:50.269 --> 00:40:54.349
she ended up again in that same spot so

00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:56.359
we had to go back and had to cut it was

00:40:56.359 --> 00:40:59.089
disgusting yeah what are they numbing up

00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:05.450
with I just needles yeah but that's over

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:24.019
gain how do people respond when you

00:41:24.019 --> 00:41:25.999
self-identify as [ __ ] they're always

00:41:25.999 --> 00:41:30.690
a cut now haha why you laughing

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:33.840
I can't put that on P I can't well you

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.970

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:38.310
like I was a fan code switch yeah yeah

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:40.380
yeah I can't act like I can't put people

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.170
in that discomfort it kills me what to

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:45.930
have them be like oh like for me to like

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:47.310
make a joke of them being uncomfortable

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:50.490
I can't commit to it I know oh I'm so

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.410
jealous yeah people get like deeply

00:41:52.410 --> 00:42:00.000
uncomfortable and Rea I either you so I

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.490
think it's hilarious I can't watch oh

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:05.910
yeah yeah it's like burns yeah yeah I

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.760
like that feeling kind of like writhed

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.710
in agony and like mentally he was like

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.920
sucking on a cavity to me really yeah

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.330
between two ferns I feel like I can I

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:18.060
can see like his potatoes of rooting for

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:28.500
the ghosts but no he Zach Galifianakis

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.110
is is a really good act like this is his

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:32.730
thing like being his deadpan character

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.430
the people that he has on they're not as

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:38.730
good as actors at that as he is what

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:40.140
he's doing so you can tell that it's

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.820
with a lot of people you can tell that

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.950
he's not real you just I can watch that

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.350
because this is clearly something this

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:49.620
is a thing that I mean but with the Eric

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.810
Andre show people don't know what the

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:53.670
[ __ ] about to happen yeah you know he

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.290
was like surprising people with [ __ ] and

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:58.050
I really you know I mean so that's like

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.210
it's that to me is like it's hard to

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:01.890
watch I love it dude that's thing I

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:03.480
can't I couldn't watch toe surgery but I

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.430
love watching people when I would do

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:06.960
stand-up and people wouldn't laugh but

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.920
in like the whole room I get

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.360
uncomfortable on my head I'm like it's

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.830
my second favorite thing I'm like yes

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:11.930
well that's different

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:15.780
I can't I think not grows odd of like

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.370
being serious to make people

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:17.970
uncomfortable

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:19.470
I can definitely deal with people not

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:20.760
thinking I'm funny and I'm trying really

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.320
hard not even that it's when you say

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.040
something that people don't necessarily

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.070
laugh at but they go like I mean I love

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.990
that yeah yeah then I grate them and

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:32.700
yeah well that's kind of that's yeah cuz

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.780
I get stuck in that cuz that's kind of

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.270
my style of comedies is a more deadpan

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:38.880
not like not to let you know that I'm

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.390
joking

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:41.040
as I'm joking yeah you do a really great

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.420
job of saying things that

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:43.770
make people really uncomfortable and

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:45.990
ending laughs yeah yeah you're like so

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.640
you're coming at the opposite you're the

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.900
backwards yeah but if it doesn't work

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:53.460
I'm like I didn't mean to do that like

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:57.809
that bring people out of my yes I didn't

00:43:57.809 --> 00:43:59.760
want that I want to go I want to set up

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.030
a tour where I go to just like old like

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:05.819
55 year old bingo halls like old white

00:44:05.819 --> 00:44:07.619
people's stuff and just go and film like

00:44:07.619 --> 00:44:09.900
ten sets of making people supremely

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:15.859
uncomfortable and effectively bombing

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:20.760
laughter just be like ten ten different

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.329
like 30-minute sets I mean I honestly do

00:44:24.329 --> 00:44:28.559
like ten five minutes but right here in

00:44:28.559 --> 00:44:30.770
the guy calling bingo in the background

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:34.890
it's like any time any time that would

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:41.099
do crowd work do you love your

00:44:41.099 --> 00:44:51.900
girlfriend like sometimes when people do

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.640
[ __ ] like that I would have to leave the

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.690
room because I knew they were gonna

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.579
recover but like it was always funny to

00:44:56.579 --> 00:44:58.980
me cuz I math would do card work and

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.450
bring this jokes are like a screeching

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:02.460
halt let me make it really awkward and

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.049
they go right back into a set like it

00:45:04.049 --> 00:45:04.710
didn't happen

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:09.390
like okay whatever and it's just like

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:10.589

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:16.680
the math in terms of like how long you

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.750
guys been together like oh you guys are

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:20.880
only dating there's you know there's it

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.950
best you guys get married and even that

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.540
leaves the only 50% chance of staying

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:25.920
together and that would get people

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:33.000
pretty kind of unconference off but like

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.869
just know that you guys probably

00:45:35.869 --> 00:45:39.420
mathematically won't work out even if

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.010
you guys go even if your relationship

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.809
succeeds in this dating thing you're

00:45:42.809 --> 00:45:45.569
doing even if you win you still have a

00:45:45.569 --> 00:45:48.210
50% chance of falling apart you know

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.510
you're gonna love midsummer

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:51.839
[Laughter]

00:45:51.839 --> 00:45:53.400
I thought that was funny to point out

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.279
and people just be kind of like that's

00:45:56.279 --> 00:45:57.690
no it's not a funny thing to point out

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:58.920
but it's funny that you're saying it to

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.839
a person that is having it pointed out

00:46:00.839 --> 00:46:02.190
to them sure that's funny

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:04.319
that's fine yeah no one agreed though I

00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:06.240
tried it a couple times I should make

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.789
fun of waiters that usually flatlined I

00:46:08.789 --> 00:46:10.920
loved that I always loved food that was

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.319
my favorite thing to do yeah just point

00:46:13.319 --> 00:46:14.880
out what they get paid for my waiters

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:24.539
that were working or go drop those tater

00:46:24.539 --> 00:46:28.109
tots all right you guys comfortable with

00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:30.839
this okay probably worse it's probably

00:46:30.839 --> 00:46:33.210
worse I would break down why waiters are

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:36.000
just like basically absolute like why

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.380
they get paid two dollars and eighty

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:41.490
three why they only deserved whatever

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:52.529
we're giving them is pity this was like

00:46:52.529 --> 00:46:54.240
seven hundred years ago I'd be spitting

00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:03.990
at you guys right now you'd be a [ __ ]

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:06.539
waiters you'd be looking at waiters like

00:47:06.539 --> 00:47:09.690
damn I wish I would just be one of the

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:11.250
extras in Game of Thrones that go

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:12.779
through flea bottom there's one guy in

00:47:12.779 --> 00:47:20.220
the dirt okay [ __ ] all over your face

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.240
for sure

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.200
it was a little heavy line of peasantry

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.170
dude my whole my whole face a were tied

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:29.910
to the you kneel dynasty in Ireland

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:31.380
which they tell every [ __ ] how much

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.839
person on ancestry.com but yeah we're

00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:35.369
from County Cork yeah they're like your

00:47:35.369 --> 00:47:36.960
you kneel dynasty you're tied to that

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.940
it's like well you know whatever but I

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.160
think it's my family lineage is a heavy

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.220
legacy of which we'll call it peasantry

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:48.359
yeah you try to like visit the village

00:47:48.359 --> 00:47:50.099

00:47:50.099 --> 00:47:51.720
anyone catches wind of it they like duck

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.480
you they do not want their [ __ ] fat

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.390
dumb American kin showing up into town

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.069
no they're kind of embarrassing yeah

00:47:59.069 --> 00:48:00.930
yeah I saw I saw where my pop-up was

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:02.309
from and it was like a it was like a

00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:03.720
little cottage like in the woods and you

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.330

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:30.790

my family has been like yeah just like

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:43.660
regular as poor people and this actually

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.130
goes back to like what our Halloween

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:47.140
costumes are I showed my eight-year-old

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:51.340
9 9 year old the original Halloween yeah

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:52.690
and now he wants to be Michael Myers

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:54.700
from Halloween and today he just I

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.380
walked into the gym as he was showing

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.120
Sid he was like I drew a picture of me

00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.860
as Michael Myers what he steps on the

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.630
guy's head yeah when he's [ __ ]

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:03.490
brushes the guy's skull his boot yeah

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:06.820
anyway when I showed ya when I showed

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.170
the original Halloween and got him all

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:09.910
hyped on it there is a part where

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:11.950
they're like showing like the

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:13.270
neighborhood the night of Halloween all

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:14.410
the kids are trick-or-treating and I was

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:16.030
like damn that's one of the nicest

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.509
[ __ ] neighborhoods

00:50:17.509 --> 00:50:19.969
I've ever seen movie Halloween in the

00:50:19.969 --> 00:50:21.349
movie Halloween yeah what's the place

00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:22.880
called again I forget there's a good

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.429
anyway I was like that's so [ __ ]

00:50:25.429 --> 00:50:26.749
picturesque like it made me like

00:50:26.749 --> 00:50:29.719
nostalgic for a place and like people

00:50:29.719 --> 00:50:31.789
that I didn't grow up you know around

00:50:31.789 --> 00:50:33.859
mmm I was like damn I liked it my kids

00:50:33.859 --> 00:50:35.179
don't have that like autumn leaves

00:50:35.179 --> 00:50:37.279
covering the street walking past

00:50:37.279 --> 00:50:38.959
driveways and then like you catch

00:50:38.959 --> 00:50:40.399
Michael Myers like standing in one of

00:50:40.399 --> 00:50:42.109
the yards and I was like and they don't

00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:47.239
you know that many murderers do one

00:50:47.239 --> 00:50:52.309
murderer but it's like they got Michael

00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:57.439
Myers yeah one guy out there just a

00:50:57.439 --> 00:50:58.969
knife don't remember every scene am on a

00:50:58.969 --> 00:51:05.059
motorcycle yeah but they'll never those

00:51:05.059 --> 00:51:07.519
kids will never be called poppy that's

00:51:07.519 --> 00:51:09.679
fair yeah I do think that there is like

00:51:09.679 --> 00:51:12.919
a richness to raising a child outside of

00:51:12.919 --> 00:51:15.139
the privilege that you know I don't want

00:51:15.139 --> 00:51:16.279
to say they deserve but they would

00:51:16.279 --> 00:51:18.049
probably receive if you know their

00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:19.939
station was different and it's like oh

00:51:19.939 --> 00:51:20.809
cool they're gonna have street smarts

00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:23.539
it's like yeah but they're also gonna be

00:51:23.539 --> 00:51:25.189
like definitely at risk of some

00:51:25.189 --> 00:51:27.289
traumatic experiences pretty much every

00:51:27.289 --> 00:51:28.069
day of their lives

00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:30.739
yeah yeah but you're also you're gonna

00:51:30.739 --> 00:51:32.329
know that your kids are capable of

00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:34.369
handling that I mean for me I'm always

00:51:34.369 --> 00:51:36.079
concerned because I grew up in that

00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:37.939
environment my kids are not growing up

00:51:37.939 --> 00:51:40.909
in that environment mm-hmm so you they

00:51:40.909 --> 00:51:42.349
at least get to see when you tell them

00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:44.659
stuff that your paranoia is justified

00:51:44.659 --> 00:51:46.789
yeah you know they look ah yeah [ __ ]

00:51:46.789 --> 00:51:49.130
that's right right like my kids look out

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:50.839
and they're like what's dad talking

00:51:50.839 --> 00:51:52.999
about uh yeah now we have to like

00:51:52.999 --> 00:51:54.349
decontaminate our kids at the door

00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:55.669
because you could just get hepatitis

00:51:55.669 --> 00:51:57.529
from playing outside now you know really

00:51:57.529 --> 00:51:59.989
yeah because of the heroin epidemic ills

00:51:59.989 --> 00:52:01.669
and [ __ ] and the human poop everywhere

00:52:01.669 --> 00:52:03.829
there's a lot of human poop was talking

00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:08.599
about it that's like junk dude yeah so I

00:52:08.599 --> 00:52:10.459
don't know I'm on the fence about it

00:52:10.459 --> 00:52:12.259
it's definitely cool having kids that

00:52:12.259 --> 00:52:14.329
like know what's up but at the same time

00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:16.249
I'm like man I wish they had the

00:52:16.249 --> 00:52:18.499
opportunity to be like near Michael

00:52:18.499 --> 00:52:19.909
Myers and not realize it because their

00:52:19.909 --> 00:52:22.429
[ __ ] night was so nice yeah yeah well

00:52:22.429 --> 00:52:24.169
they're not gonna get any creditor they

00:52:24.169 --> 00:52:25.609
may be over in the hood be like no you

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:28.489
did in in 15 years around like no I got

00:52:28.489 --> 00:52:29.260
I gotta be honest

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.630
and creds overrated yes so much credit

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:34.450
is definitely overrated like I'm just a

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:35.380
[ __ ] loser

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.740
that's all I feel like losers out in the

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:39.610
world ma'am

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:42.100
why because that's how I was raised I

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:44.260
was raised the [ __ ] poor loser and

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:45.900
now I'm trying to figure out how to like

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.240
like backpedal like I gotta raise kids

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.100
now I can't be a [ __ ] I got like I

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.140
got ya I gotta advanced in the world I

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.490
gotta start a business or something I

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:55.990
can struggle with it yes start a

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:58.150
business right but I just figured that

00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:59.680
out after my kids were already old

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.270
enough that I was like oh no I'm Malou

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:05.500
oh [ __ ] oh no sorry like I'm always

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.880
checking in to make sure they don't know

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.650
that I'm a loser like they can know that

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:09.820
they're poor I don't want them to know

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.550
that I'm a [ __ ] just zero how do you

00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:13.000
figure that

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.760
yeah he's no how I figure what but

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.370
that's the thing no I think that's the

00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:20.080
that's the product of my upbringing they

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.190
raised a loser

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:23.740
and I'm like I got it like I'm good now

00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:25.480
sure I got to make sure that they don't

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.000
see through you know you got yeah like

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.710
it's you know the upswing it's a moment

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:38.410

what the [ __ ] just see let's just see

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:52.570
what happens and we'll put what our

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:54.250
people are saying well I'd like to

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:55.630
apologize first of all that you'll never

00:53:55.630 --> 00:54:01.450
know the pleasure that's it I do feel

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.040
like if you went out in blackface and

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.500
someone heard you talk they for a

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:09.880
secondary well see that's the me and as

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:10.810
we were just talking about this recently

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:12.670
that's a funny thing that's always

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:13.300
happen to me

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:15.550
mm-hmm I've always I just talk the way I

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:18.310
talk we because I don't code-switch yeah

00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:20.860
so whoever I'm acclimated to mm they

00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.380
think when I talk to the other race it's

00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:25.780
gonna be a thing yeah so black people

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:29.470
are always blown away to see that I talk

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:32.640
this way to white people it blows me

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.350
know it's just like do I talk like it

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:38.230
does is there like like why does he get

00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:40.000
and then begin like why you talking like

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.210
a ghost yeah why does he

00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:43.770
it's like did I just talk the way I talk

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:45.630
like I've never tried to talk cool I

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:47.880
just grew up in a certain environment so

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.950
I kind of like have a twin that way but

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:53.400
I also read as a kid yes you know so

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:57.119
it's like you don't understand I had to

00:54:57.119 --> 00:54:59.099
switch the way I talk every time I talk

00:54:59.099 --> 00:55:00.599
to someone it's like because you don't

00:55:00.599 --> 00:55:05.700
have anything valuable to say that's

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.710
what it is if you don't have anything

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:10.619
valuable to say at least I sound smart

00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:12.599
you don't mean at least like solo still

00:55:12.599 --> 00:55:14.520
if you're switching up the way you're

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.470
talking it's because what's coming out

00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:18.720
of your mouth is worthless so you might

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.869
as well like at least appease them

00:55:21.869 --> 00:55:24.390
somehow you know it's like the way like

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:25.740
when you when you when you try to talk

00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.570
to a chick you're saying that the way

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:29.190
black people talk is unpleasant to

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:32.400
listen to no I think a lot of black

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.650
people I think a lot of people just have

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:36.630
nothing to say and the people that have

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:39.720
to code switch are those people I think

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:40.950
they're just don't realize that they're

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:43.320
just their personality suck it's like

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.790

there was no bottom on his seat this guy

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:46.550

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:48.560
air having his a season scammer checks

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:53.300

[Laughter]

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.500
dude I was watching this I watched a

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.470
video last night it was um it kind of

01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:10.700
reminded me of the code-switching thing

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.130
so so I forget who the guy was he hosted

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:17.000
a debate it was Candace Owens TI killer

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.830
money vault summit the rules of it did

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:23.870
you watch it was Candace Owens ti killer

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.900
Mike some [ __ ] due to the sweater

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:28.550
that Bob he was so annoying

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:30.200
how'd he suck remember so you killer

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.180
Mike had the big speech that was good

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.800
let's doing like okay he ran that whole

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.420
show pretty yeah he kind of crushed that

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.370
entire time because he he was trying to

01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:39.860
stop TI from talking because TI is

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:44.990
[ __ ] yeah try to save him it was so

01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:48.200
bad no I but I know those two yeah okay

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.180
yeah absolutely trying to save them

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.980
there's there's no black conservative

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.190
that has the charisma of killer Mike

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:57.440
yeah no he's not that's what I'm saying

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.490
it's so yeah I wouldn't want to stage

01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.050
with all them he's gonna [ __ ] dominate

01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:03.950
yeah yeah yeah but killer Mike is he's

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:06.230
smart though because he was he did this

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:09.770
thing where he agreed with what the

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:11.060
things that can his Owens was saying

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.580
that was true yeah but then quick

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:16.550
flipped it somehow so that he was still

01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:18.800
a lipped like on the liberal side he has

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.540
no left red though killer Mike has no

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.309
left Craig because he was

01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:24.170
it's cool with Bernie oh he also didn't

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:26.299
cancel Waffle House so people got mad at

01:01:26.299 --> 01:01:28.759
him that would hit a good [ __ ] point

01:01:28.759 --> 01:01:31.130
his point was amazing wait don't you

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:32.479
think I might have missed cancel Waffle

01:01:32.479 --> 01:01:34.969
House Waffle House so there was a Waffle

01:01:34.969 --> 01:01:36.410
House technically can charge customers

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:38.569
for silverware which is [ __ ] I don't

01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:40.369
know when that goes back to how they can

01:01:40.369 --> 01:01:42.769
so apparently the one lady charged a

01:01:42.769 --> 01:01:44.359
black lady for silver and black lady is

01:01:44.359 --> 01:01:46.160
like you know [ __ ] out here my pain

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.839
rent silverware from Waffle House or

01:01:47.839 --> 01:01:49.130
something like that they can charge you

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:51.410
like 25 cents or something yeah and but

01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:53.630
here okay good so that's what it was

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:55.969
yeah there's always more to a story

01:01:55.969 --> 01:01:56.569
right sure

01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:57.920
so this could have been a customer that

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.539
was coming there frequently just taken

01:01:59.539 --> 01:02:01.549
advantage of the silverware policy and

01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:04.849
then one time a waitress who just had a

01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:07.339
[ __ ] enough terrible day like not

01:02:07.339 --> 01:02:09.589
just pitching today yeah you know

01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:10.249
torched

01:02:10.249 --> 01:02:11.630
how was she taking advantage of the

01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:14.689
silver policy though because for the

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:16.400
most part they don't charge people yeah

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.779
they never really they can they never

01:02:17.779 --> 01:02:19.519
really do so people think so word from

01:02:19.519 --> 01:02:27.429
the wall files oh it's like that's it's

01:02:27.429 --> 01:02:29.989
like there's like lowly like chained

01:02:29.989 --> 01:02:32.029
diners and stuff like nobody respects

01:02:32.029 --> 01:02:33.769
yeah I never taken silver from the

01:02:33.769 --> 01:02:35.089
Waffle House so I definitely like you

01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:48.410
get like a nice steak knife yes

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:50.599
apparently is lady I kicked out asked to

01:02:50.599 --> 01:02:52.579
leave they call the cops yeah they

01:02:52.579 --> 01:02:55.369
called the cops call the cops the cops

01:02:55.369 --> 01:02:57.619
dude just like kick her out nothing

01:02:57.619 --> 01:03:07.309
there was some physical she got yes she

01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:09.890
got beat up in the Waffle House because

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:14.209
she didn't pay for a fork but then the

01:03:14.209 --> 01:03:15.589
whole everyone's like let's all careful

01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:17.150
cancel Waffle House and everyone was

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:18.370
like

01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:22.360
now but the funny part of that was how

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:25.150
many times potato salad was mentioned

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:28.120
that bomb that was fully out of me dude

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.560
it was a I mean I'm gonna side with a

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.510
good potato salad and you know when the

01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:33.160
potato salad shut when that guy with the

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.420
[ __ ] sweater draped over his

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:35.950
shoulders was like you know I'm saying

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:37.510
like we got we bring the flavor like you

01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:38.380
know like when we were doing it like the

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.820
potato salad just right it's like dude

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:41.680
shut the [ __ ] up he was just trying it

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.610
was just trying to own blackness yeah

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:49.690
Rabia nerd yeah he was not like it would

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:54.670
be like my son cornrows talking about

01:03:54.670 --> 01:04:01.330
patina like dude is like stop it God be

01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:02.740
like you know I'm on the side with a

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:04.270
good potato sack was he just trying to

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:06.550
like generate a gift for people to use

01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:07.150
the army

01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:08.950
sort of they all work with the potatoes

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:10.630
oh yeah they all definitely were

01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:13.060
annoying as [ __ ] yeah and that's what

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:14.380
was really bothering me because it was

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.990
like one of the things we want to do

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:19.840
with this revolt summit is prove that

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.240
black people are not a monolith and then

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.770
it was like let's all pass on this

01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:37.270
potato what it's like all his philosophy

01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:39.130
flows around like shitty Facebook

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:40.770
arguments he's like name one time

01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:43.540
America was great and like I met and

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:44.680
then she would start talking all my

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.900
editor was like which is the [ __ ]

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:49.030
premise yeah it's like so especially

01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:50.470
when you made a million dollars and well

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:54.330
no that's also kind of an uncle an

01:04:54.330 --> 01:05:01.450
argument for that so his issue is with

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:05.170
magnet the phrase so he's like when was

01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:06.790
America ever great for black people

01:05:06.790 --> 01:05:08.380
right so he's saying that's a racist

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.630
term because there was never a time

01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:12.460
period it was great for black people so

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:13.600
how are we gonna make America great

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.810
again

01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:23.710
how many call each other [ __ ] on that

01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:26.590
on a stage that's racist because it was

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:29.380
an actual racist term used to demean

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.230
black people so what are we [ __ ]

01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:33.480
talking about what how black people like

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.590
they all call each other [ __ ] all the

01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:38.970
time sure that was a racist word saying

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:42.110
in order to make America great again

01:05:42.110 --> 01:06:01.860
[Laughter]

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.840
[Music]

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:46.619
because like he's wearing blackface for

01:06:46.619 --> 01:06:57.270
being recorded whisper to you it's [ __ ]

01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:00.180
and like oh you may say [ __ ] are not

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.859
calling someone a [ __ ] like yeah [ __ ]

01:07:01.859 --> 01:07:08.430
is like yeah that's not racist when

01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:10.380
that's why that's why it's looked at

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.300
because I was like it's not racist it's

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.040
just like that's what it is but it's

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:22.470
like Spanish wise why is like table like

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:23.820
a feminine noun or something like that

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.000
you mean yeah well they're gonna they're

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.560
gonna take the gender out I'm just

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.359
saying there's no connotation to saying

01:07:30.359 --> 01:07:32.360
the n-word or [ __ ]

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.410
[Music]

01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:36.270
so just to close that loop all I'm

01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:38.190
saying is if you if you so the use of

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:40.410
the n-word is about quite reclaiming it

01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:42.349
right and you're making it your own

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:45.229
in turn reclaimed though are they are

01:07:45.229 --> 01:07:46.249
you arguing that it hasn't been

01:07:46.249 --> 01:07:48.709
reclaimed I'm arguing that it's [ __ ]

01:07:48.709 --> 01:07:51.380
to reclaim it why I'm it's not gonna

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:58.609
pass judgement is not a word I I don't

01:07:58.609 --> 01:08:00.439
refer to anybody that way never heard

01:08:00.439 --> 01:08:03.859
you say no it's not it's [ __ ] one of

01:08:03.859 --> 01:08:13.339
my kids there but ya know it's just dumb

01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:15.439
you're gonna say that the word magnet

01:08:15.439 --> 01:08:17.179
the phrase magnet is racist it's just a

01:08:17.179 --> 01:08:19.460
[ __ ] premise it's coming from a

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.290
group of [ __ ] half [ __ ] people

01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:24.859
yeah you know it's like it's not it's

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:26.770
like a lot of a lot of black culture

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:32.139
dumps itself down non-stop so it's like

01:08:32.139 --> 01:08:35.029
it just it's just weird where it's like

01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:37.579
you got a bunch of people and I don't

01:08:37.579 --> 01:08:43.369
mean hypnotized you guys people like

01:08:43.369 --> 01:08:44.599
calling each other [ __ ] all the time

01:08:44.599 --> 01:08:46.969
right and then complaining about the

01:08:46.969 --> 01:08:50.389
undercover racism and it's like

01:08:50.389 --> 01:08:52.520
something's amiss here so one big

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:59.299
hypnotism none I will dude my

01:08:59.299 --> 01:09:00.650
multiculturalism class was actually

01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:01.400
really funny

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.040
someone we got to write like cards

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.659
basically like for a question and

01:09:05.659 --> 01:09:07.609
someone was like it was the first

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:09.290
[ __ ] question they someone answered

01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:10.549
from the box I already had the class

01:09:10.549 --> 01:09:12.139
fired up about I was like talking to

01:09:12.139 --> 01:09:13.759
people firing people up obviously of

01:09:13.759 --> 01:09:16.130
course and then they're like right we're

01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:17.929
gonna go to the box first [ __ ]

01:09:17.929 --> 01:09:19.819
someone put on the top of the deck why

01:09:19.819 --> 01:09:32.210
can't way people say it was so [ __ ]

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:34.369
funny I started laughing out loud and I

01:09:34.369 --> 01:09:35.929
immediately was like that's not my card

01:09:35.929 --> 01:09:40.250
I'd like to say real quick why I came

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.199
off the hot seat for being like you guys

01:09:42.199 --> 01:09:43.849
are teaching in an institutional setting

01:09:43.849 --> 01:09:46.009
you guys are trying to equate the evils

01:09:46.009 --> 01:09:47.659
of the world with white people I was

01:09:47.659 --> 01:09:48.829
like you can't do that from the

01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:50.449
seventeen hundreds on but this is a

01:09:50.449 --> 01:09:52.130
weird thing to try to teach to people

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:53.869
although you guys are teaching racist

01:09:53.869 --> 01:09:55.590
this is like white why can see

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:58.739
although that that's what so like this

01:09:58.739 --> 01:10:01.080
is what annoys me about you Matt could

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.699
you give them sort of [ __ ] [ __ ] do

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.830
you know me you always it's like no it

01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:08.369
was never racism it was never it was

01:10:08.369 --> 01:10:11.580
never about racism right slavery wasn't

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:12.840
about cuz that's that's an argument I

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.760
get in with a lot of black people where

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.179
they're like white people are racist

01:10:17.179 --> 01:10:20.880
slavery that means I think slavery

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.980
wasn't about racism Owens got jammed up

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.719
when she goes slavery wasn't ubiquitous

01:10:24.719 --> 01:10:27.150
and Ti goes man you open your mouth and

01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:29.460
said some [ __ ] and it's like no

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:34.710
that's like she was a little bit of

01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:37.650
racism is slavery no no okay good

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:39.810
but I make a similar argument how about

01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:42.210
how it was never about sexism I mean

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:43.739
what I mean I think the patriarchy

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:46.170
wasn't like everyone just lived outside

01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:48.210
and like did like society kind of like

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:51.599
fell in line here and women benefited in

01:10:51.599 --> 01:10:55.770
that system but I see so I see you it's

01:10:55.770 --> 01:10:57.150
like yeah it's just the way things lined

01:10:57.150 --> 01:10:59.460
up I guess no not at all I mean well I

01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:03.030
guess you know like in I guess in a

01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:05.520
broader scope that is what I'm saying I

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.860
mean that's like the whole book Guns

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:10.050
Germs and Steel from a broader scope is

01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:11.400
best basically what it's saying right

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.449
but it's like the slave trade the slaves

01:11:15.449 --> 01:11:17.849
slaves built civilization just period

01:11:17.849 --> 01:11:20.880
yeah like all across the world slaves

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:30.960
built like I still do and if you got

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.969
away with slavery right after you finish

01:11:32.969 --> 01:11:36.050
the pyramids like oh this was actually

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.639
true people were living near each other

01:11:38.639 --> 01:11:40.739
enslaving each other for all of history

01:11:40.739 --> 01:11:42.449
and building and that was just the most

01:11:42.449 --> 01:11:45.389
recent one where they're like wait no it

01:11:45.389 --> 01:11:46.739
was like they felt like so white people

01:11:46.739 --> 01:11:49.619
found like a new place needed to build

01:11:49.619 --> 01:11:50.940
us it was their hand was at the top of

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:56.960
the baseball white people didn't go like

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.030
yeah they went to the slave trade and

the ocean like while floating freely I

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.390

what's up yeah no never jerked off in

01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:46.790
the woods I used to but like my

01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:50.390
situation is a little so I used to ask

01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:58.970
now there was an opportunity that I

01:19:58.970 --> 01:20:01.400
could pass through you weren't camping

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:05.630
you're on the way I lived it I lived

01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:06.710
with a lot of people I lived in a

01:20:06.710 --> 01:20:08.840
crowded house that's all used to jerk

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.300
off dry it dry sure that's that's why I

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:16.180
developed that seal and I would Turk I

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:21.290
was there to pull baby powder out of

01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:27.680

and um when she told me that the first

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.510
thing I said to her was I don't think

what it's like it's there well I've

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.160

01:25:30.659 --> 01:25:32.099
that I've had every time I swung a golf

01:25:32.099 --> 01:25:34.139

01:25:34.139 --> 01:25:36.239
the top of the swing and by the end I'm

01:25:36.239 --> 01:25:37.920
just gonna close my eyes and I hope that

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:40.139
it worked out and I'm gonna be

01:25:40.139 --> 01:25:41.940
completely unenjoyable yeah it's also

01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:43.290
something in more you think about it the

01:25:43.290 --> 01:25:46.199

01:25:46.199 --> 01:25:48.960
of my sexuality where where my sexuality

01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:25.139
last day of my dopamine fast I've been

oh no I'm coming

01:27:39.829 --> 01:27:41.959
my thing is now it's like when you it's

01:27:41.959 --> 01:27:43.849
like when you give someone almost like a

01:27:43.849 --> 01:27:46.189
job where it's like look I need to come

01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:48.979

01:27:48.979 --> 01:27:50.659
that's gonna do this for me can I rely

01:27:50.659 --> 01:27:52.729
on you for that yeah it's been a very

01:27:52.729 --> 01:27:54.559
fantastic verse as she's received that

01:27:54.559 --> 01:27:56.809

01:27:56.809 --> 01:27:58.429

that's the way to go that's the way

01:28:08.329 --> 01:28:09.559
that's what I'm trying to say that's the

01:28:09.559 --> 01:28:12.530
way to do it well yeah I mean I think

01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:14.570
once you start respecting each other as

01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:17.179
like humans that have base needs the

01:28:17.179 --> 01:28:19.039
relationship is really easy yeah yeah

01:28:19.039 --> 01:28:21.530
because it's like sometimes I gotta come

01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:22.729
now or like I got a lash out on

01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:24.709
something you know not gonna mean it's a

01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:27.079
couple night when I get in you know one

01:28:27.079 --> 01:28:29.959
of my eventual confrontations with

01:28:29.959 --> 01:28:31.550
somebody or something mm-hmm

01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:33.079
so she understands so you needed that

01:28:33.079 --> 01:28:39.649
you need to come yeah public

01:28:39.649 --> 01:28:45.859
confrontations with people you're one of

01:28:45.859 --> 01:28:47.239
the highest level public confrontation

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:49.219
dudes I've ever been needed I wonder if

01:28:49.219 --> 01:28:50.599
I'm gonna start the rumor that during

01:28:50.599 --> 01:28:52.010
all your public confrontations is like

01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:53.479
the D'Angelo video we're securely

01:28:53.479 --> 01:29:07.609
getting a [ __ ] due tomorrow starts

01:29:07.609 --> 01:29:10.789
the two-month quest tomorrow starts our

01:29:10.789 --> 01:29:13.429
midsummer I haven't seen wait somewhere

01:29:13.429 --> 01:29:15.800
I can't say but yeah tomorrow starts the

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:18.499
[ __ ] beta the beta testing I can't

01:29:18.499 --> 01:29:20.479
wait yeah I'm pretty so [ __ ] excited

01:29:20.479 --> 01:29:23.359
two months for people listening the book

01:29:23.359 --> 01:29:26.539
I'm writing is basically this program

01:29:26.539 --> 01:29:27.919
that I'm putting you putting together

01:29:27.919 --> 01:29:29.869
where it's like two months of micro

01:29:29.869 --> 01:29:32.149
dosing you squad up with a bunch of your

01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:34.070
dogs which is I think the best that's a

01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:35.629
left out part people always talk about

01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:37.969
set and setting but it's like if you can

01:29:37.969 --> 01:29:39.289
get your dog so I'm trying to recreate

01:29:39.289 --> 01:29:41.089
the tribe basically yeah people used to

01:29:41.089 --> 01:29:43.339
take them with their dogs in a tent and

01:29:43.339 --> 01:29:45.649
it was it just takes the edge off yeah

01:29:45.649 --> 01:29:47.059
whenever I try to do this [ __ ] like when

01:29:47.059 --> 01:29:48.829
I'm doing it by myself I just go to

01:29:48.829 --> 01:29:50.780
weirdo weirdo world instantly as kind of

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:51.380
like loop

01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:53.210
I start thinking on my subconscious and

01:29:53.210 --> 01:29:55.310
freak the [ __ ] out so it's like you have

01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:57.110
a group text all your dogs are vibing

01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:58.040
having a good time

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.530
you'd microdose for two months you know

01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:02.920
and then I don't have it it's not very

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.940
agendized yet really it's just kind of

01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:06.050
like pick something you want to work on

01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:08.030
record your thoughts anything that pops

01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:09.409
up that like you're like oh this is cool

01:30:09.409 --> 01:30:11.000
ever thought about this before you know

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:11.960
and I'll send little surveys like

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:14.360
quality of life index and then at the

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:15.949
end of two months there's a two-week

01:30:15.949 --> 01:30:18.080
break then on the Solstice everyone

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.670
takes like a moderate dose goes out in

01:30:19.670 --> 01:30:21.050
the woods chills then we go out for a

01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:25.219
feast after I'm so fine excited I mean

01:30:25.219 --> 01:30:27.889
dude that's a it's a potentially

01:30:27.889 --> 01:30:30.260
life-changing two months and then going

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:31.730
right into winter like that that's a

01:30:31.730 --> 01:30:33.800
nice way to approach the winter every

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.630
time I'm sick done mushrooms or micro

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:36.980

01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:39.679
yeah dude every single time yeah awesome

01:30:39.679 --> 01:30:40.909
except the one time when I had a

01:30:40.909 --> 01:30:42.710
concussion the day before and I'd micro

01:30:42.710 --> 01:30:43.940
dose him I didn't sleep for like three

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:44.989
days but it's because of the concussion

01:30:44.989 --> 01:30:47.290
you probably don't want to sleep then I

01:30:47.290 --> 01:30:50.750

[ __ ] trees on the right and left and

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.739

is just like super loud like shoegaze E

01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:47.690
and an overwhelming sound and I came out

01:31:47.690 --> 01:31:50.210
of the trees to like the most beautiful

01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:52.340
blue sky and like billowing clouds I've

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:55.219
ever seen and then just all I'm looking

01:31:55.219 --> 01:31:57.380
at is like distant hills and farms it

01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:59.420
looks like a Bob Ross painting and then

01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:02.090
just like not even at the top of my

01:32:02.090 --> 01:32:04.159
windshield but directly in my view was

01:32:04.159 --> 01:32:04.469
this

01:32:04.469 --> 01:32:06.389
I was flying one of those like gliders

01:32:06.389 --> 01:32:08.369
that are unpowered like they get towed

01:32:08.369 --> 01:32:09.659
up into the sky and they just [ __ ]

01:32:09.659 --> 01:32:11.460
drift down that's all and he was

01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:14.070
dragging these little tiny vapor trails

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:16.079
behind him and it was another moment I

01:32:16.079 --> 01:32:20.460
was like this yeah dude if I die young

01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:25.139

today for sure yeah man that's the me

01:32:44.699 --> 01:32:45.900
I'm telling you it's the missing piece

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:49.159
of civilization is the reenter

01:32:49.159 --> 01:32:51.059
hallucinogenics backing it in a way that

01:32:51.059 --> 01:32:53.369
doesn't bug people out and freak people

01:32:53.369 --> 01:32:55.800
out it's like we pretty much conquered

01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:58.860
physical necessities for the most part

01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:00.690
of you working out a couple kinks as

01:33:00.690 --> 01:33:02.070
soon as we you know because our

01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:03.780
religions all dead and all that as soon

01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:05.760
as we throw in the psychedelic stuff

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:08.400
that can be the that's the thing we can

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:09.960
put our minds on rather than all the

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.940
dumb [ __ ] like extreme politics that

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.920
are just naturally going to overtake you

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:14.999
know people because they don't have any

01:33:14.999 --> 01:33:16.349
sort of like religious or any sense of

01:33:16.349 --> 01:33:18.150
purpose or anything if you hit it with

01:33:18.150 --> 01:33:20.579
the psychedelics ever all this dumb

01:33:20.579 --> 01:33:21.929
political [ __ ] goes out the [ __ ]

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:23.789
window if we take the material needs

01:33:23.789 --> 01:33:25.229
make it sustainable show other people

01:33:25.229 --> 01:33:27.599

people are closer like they're closer to

01:33:56.369 --> 01:33:58.409
like Caligula than anything else like

01:33:58.409 --> 01:34:00.289

01:41:30.239 --> 01:41:32.910
point where so remember back in the day

01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:35.460
when we first met I used to always stop

01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:39.150
smoking around like rum fall and take a

01:41:39.150 --> 01:41:40.920
long break and then sort of smoking it

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:44.520
yeah and in that time it was like I feel

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:47.820
great when I wasn't smoking but I would

01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:51.420
just I just like being high I just like

01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:55.469
it it's fun yeah and like funny because

01:41:55.469 --> 01:41:57.390
like I would start getting this momentum

01:41:57.390 --> 01:41:59.790
in comedy I was like getting booked more

01:41:59.790 --> 01:42:01.260
I had like the patients that actually

01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:03.210
send emails and sit down and do all that

01:42:03.210 --> 01:42:05.160
[ __ ] and then I would start smoking and

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.320
they're just like all completely like in

01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:11.190
six months like slowing down

01:42:11.190 --> 01:42:14.550
so yeah it's uh I mean I don't again I

01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:16.350
have to stop smoking just so I can like

01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:18.380
buckle down and get things done

01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:20.850
yeah I could see that I have a problem

01:42:20.850 --> 01:42:22.890
when like when I don't have any like so

01:42:22.890 --> 01:42:24.630
I've had like really no weed in my

01:42:24.630 --> 01:42:26.130
system and like I'll get to the point

01:42:26.130 --> 01:42:28.620
where like I can't focus on pretty much

01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.929

01:46:56.820 --> 01:46:59.280
they don't like like he says [ __ ] the

01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.460
gears are spinning Shane's not funny is

01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:04.139
fifteen cogs in that right that's a safe

01:47:04.139 --> 01:47:07.500
way to process that [ __ ] to show your

01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:10.170
side yeah exactly yeah that girl with

01:47:10.170 --> 01:47:12.810
the self haircut that wrote that bullsh

01:47:12.810 --> 01:47:15.840
I mean just shoddy fake news article

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:17.790
about obviously fake news me saying hey

01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:19.949
I'm an alpha obviously got fake news I

01:47:19.949 --> 01:47:21.300
think she said you're not funny

01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:24.210
tried or like Anthony Jeselnik said he'd

01:47:24.210 --> 01:47:24.900
you're not funny

01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:27.710
yeah that to me is completely

01:47:27.710 --> 01:47:30.420
indefensible that's not an argument I'm

01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:32.730
never gonna hear my [ __ ] funniest

01:47:32.730 --> 01:47:35.190
dude in the world my school was on the

01:47:35.190 --> 01:47:36.750
line dude like where'd you learn to

01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:38.040
learn about psychedelic therapy I was

01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:47.489
like in my basement that's what I would

01:47:47.489 --> 01:47:52.860
make fun of you for like your life for

01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:54.420
the last not because you thought it

01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:56.960
would be awkward favorite part of this

01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:59.639
was when we were setting up the joke

01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:01.170
about you making fun of waiters and that

01:48:01.170 --> 01:48:04.050
he did his version which was like

01:48:04.050 --> 01:48:10.739
compare dance thank you for that fine it

01:48:10.739 --> 01:48:12.719
was fun I there was there was one part

01:48:12.719 --> 01:48:14.369
there was that and then there was like I

01:48:14.369 --> 01:48:16.409
was kind of basically telling him like I

01:48:16.409 --> 01:48:18.690
don't adhere to the social or code of it

01:48:18.690 --> 01:48:19.920
I was like oh you know I can pick and

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:21.449
choose because I have my own moral code

01:48:21.449 --> 01:48:24.210
and that was like you know as like I was

01:48:24.210 --> 01:48:25.710
like to be honest like this whole like

01:48:25.710 --> 01:48:27.840
code of ethics thing is kind of like Ten

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.639
Commandments and I'm like more like love

01:48:29.639 --> 01:48:31.770
fulfills all kind of guy dude I saw the

01:48:31.770 --> 01:48:40.770
one guy just go like like what box do I

01:48:40.770 --> 01:48:41.739
check on what

01:48:41.739 --> 01:48:49.389
what the [ __ ] was that realms weights

01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:51.999
you're saying you're not going to uphold

01:48:51.999 --> 01:48:53.619
the code of ethics you sign to uphold

01:48:53.619 --> 01:48:54.760
I'm like yeah I don't really believe in

01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.610
the hold is that I don't recognize

01:48:57.610 --> 01:49:02.800
exactly they're like um okay well you

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:05.170
have to and I'm like nah I don't really

01:49:05.170 --> 01:49:21.849
believe I love the realm of codes Shane

01:49:21.849 --> 01:49:24.070
no I didn't do that at all I didn't have

01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:25.510
to do anything like that oh they asked

01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:27.699
about they were just kind of asking

01:49:27.699 --> 01:49:30.699
about like my like like way to like

01:49:30.699 --> 01:49:32.739
you're you like playing a character what

01:49:32.739 --> 01:49:34.090
exactly are you doing I'm like we're

01:49:34.090 --> 01:49:35.469
just bullshitting around we're [ __ ]

01:49:35.469 --> 01:49:36.789
around I would say everyone plays the

01:49:36.789 --> 01:49:39.219
character obviously the face we decided

01:49:39.219 --> 01:49:41.130
to show the world

01:49:41.130 --> 01:49:43.150
yeah I was like we're [ __ ] around

01:49:43.150 --> 01:49:44.769
we're having a good time we're messing

01:49:44.769 --> 01:49:46.150
around it's just you know it's fun and

01:49:46.150 --> 01:49:47.530
there they were dude they were like

01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:49.510
super [ __ ] nice about the whole thing

01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:52.300
holy [ __ ] like really nice you didn't

01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:53.860
have the coat switch on them anymore

01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:56.829
dude if you listen I have it were you

01:49:56.829 --> 01:49:58.030
code switching when you were talking to

01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:59.260
those types of people before you just

01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:03.309
like I was just casting yeah let's talk

01:50:03.309 --> 01:50:05.349
in role yeah it was so fun I got to

01:50:05.349 --> 01:50:06.880
explain like my beef with the school

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:08.349
they're like three of the you know do

01:50:08.349 --> 01:50:10.719
you offer up so much in your responses

01:50:10.719 --> 01:50:14.170
in that part in the traits in that realm

01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:16.840
like when I'm yes and no if I'm in

01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:19.360
equation like that I guess my knowledge

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.099
Social Work school is just like there's

01:50:21.099 --> 01:50:22.719
no right answer for anything and you

01:50:22.719 --> 01:50:24.489
just have to like talk and sound as sick

01:50:24.489 --> 01:50:28.179
as you possibly can someone okay it's

01:50:28.179 --> 01:50:29.619
pretty tight dude it was fun we got to

01:50:29.619 --> 01:50:31.449
like I got to basically be like yeah I

01:50:31.449 --> 01:50:32.769
don't really because they deconstruct

01:50:32.769 --> 01:50:34.300
everything so guys see what you guys are

01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:35.559
saying with the Code of Ethics but it's

01:50:35.559 --> 01:50:37.239
like I was like he's like we're trying

01:50:37.239 --> 01:50:38.559
to protect the clients I'm like yeah but

01:50:38.559 --> 01:50:39.880
it's kind of like an incomplete fence

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:41.769
because like you guys think you have

01:50:41.769 --> 01:50:43.179
this thing built but there's like all

01:50:43.179 --> 01:50:46.889
this other space that I kind of inhabit

01:50:49.079 --> 01:50:53.070
my flavor of social work

01:50:53.070 --> 01:50:56.460
basically but if I were to like cut the

01:50:56.460 --> 01:50:58.410
parts off of myself that make me me and

01:50:58.410 --> 01:51:00.180
fit into the all these boxes I'd have to

01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:02.280
check I'd become like an automaton where

01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:03.900
I'm basically now like soulless and dead

01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.160
and now I'm no good to anyone and

01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:06.570
they're just like well I see what you're

01:51:06.570 --> 01:51:08.130
saying philosophically but I mean like

01:51:08.130 --> 01:51:09.690
you have to uphold these in like math

01:51:09.690 --> 01:51:10.650
you know what they're worried about

01:51:10.650 --> 01:51:11.610
they're worried you're gonna be too good

01:51:11.610 --> 01:51:13.290
and then there's not gonna be a part to

01:51:13.290 --> 01:51:15.060
you don't I mean like it's to its

01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:17.220
intrinsic to your character I mean and

01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:18.240
then on you're not gonna be able to

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:20.130
train a protege I might read I might

01:51:20.130 --> 01:51:21.950
reinvent Social Work cause nobody'll

01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:24.570
believe it I'm like why can't I just I'm

01:51:24.570 --> 01:51:26.160
like why is it and this they're all and

01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:27.810
this is how they can as like a snake

01:51:27.810 --> 01:51:29.190
eating its tail they're all about

01:51:29.190 --> 01:51:31.380
demolishing power structures but the

01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:34.170
board who licenses social workers is a

01:51:34.170 --> 01:51:36.000
power structure so I'm like why do we

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.220
need this power structure why can't the

01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:40.110
clients just look into whoever it is and

01:51:40.110 --> 01:51:42.480
total transparency McGill here's all my

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:44.280
[ __ ] here's what I do if you're not cool

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:44.640
with that

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.470
no problem and they were just like well

01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:48.180
some people don't have a choice is I

01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:49.770
only ever work places where people have

01:51:49.770 --> 01:51:52.470
a choice what's the problem here yeah

01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:54.000
like does it affect the place you're at

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.010
now and I'm like not at all yeah I

01:51:56.010 --> 01:51:57.240
thought I thought Social Work like

01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:59.340
relied on power structures to like find

01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:01.380
ways to like account for the people that

01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:03.030
are sort of like left by the wayside in

01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:04.170
power structures yeah but you're

01:52:04.170 --> 01:52:05.550
supposed to like bemoan than the entire

01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:07.320
time what I found that sounds like it's

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.870
a waste of time it slows down the work

01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:12.660
it's dude it's it's like I'm a carpenter

01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:14.400
but I also [ __ ] about it the whole time

01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:17.720
dude every time I swing the hammer like

01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:19.860
[ __ ] about the power structures they

01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:21.030
operate in the fact that they're

01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:23.280
basically subsidized by the corporate

01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:27.180
state and you know around that yeah and

01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:28.590
they're just kind of like they'll be

01:52:28.590 --> 01:52:30.750
moan that and then also [ __ ] about

01:52:30.750 --> 01:52:33.630
being underpaid while also be moaning

01:52:33.630 --> 01:52:35.160
capitalism it makes no [ __ ] sense

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:37.230
it's like you guys want money you want a

01:52:37.230 --> 01:52:39.480
cool job so does everybody else you know

01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:41.280
there's this whole like holier-than-thou

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:43.650
aspect to it it's just like guys do you

01:52:43.650 --> 01:52:45.600
should reinvent at the off-the-grid

01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:47.880
social work Wow come in the woods baby

01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:49.500

01:52:50.370 --> 01:52:51.510
licensed oh I might not be able to get

01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:52.710
licensed because in the woods with the

01:52:52.710 --> 01:52:56.220
