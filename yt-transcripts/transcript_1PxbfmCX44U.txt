human being yeah you know like we we get

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.920
along all the time mm-hmm and there were

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.810
there were some times when she was

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.659
pregnant when I was just like nobody

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.460
would even bat an eye if I left her

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.649
there the [ __ ] that was going on you

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.360

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.899
dudes like yes wild must be like [ __ ]

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.060
where it'll be like go do this and I'm

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.500
like yeah I'm doing something it's like

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.790
so you're not gonna do it and it's like

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.189
no you gotta hustle it's like you ever

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.270
dude it would have been like I would

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.189
have been 40 minutes late and we all

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.390
said you had to go pick up a certain

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.259
food like eat something else I I can't I

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.569
can't baby I'm like I will I would if I

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.950
wasn't doing something I will get you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.290
something but jesus [ __ ] christ you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.740
use

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.960
uber eats get something else so you want

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.370
to chick-fil-a here's like your

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.780
chick-fil-a doesn't deliver I'm like get

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.380
something [ __ ] else you got I guess I

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.590
guess you're not but you know you got to

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.090
appreciate the circumstances right

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.370
because you're dealing with woman brain

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.740
later and then pregnant woman brain

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.810
right but not done yet then you have

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.500
what society says are the expectations

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.840
that a pregnant woman is allowed to have

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.200
right so you're dealing with sure they

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.360
are allowed to be so you're saying like

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.240
there's high-octane rocket fuel in the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.860
tank and there's a societies like

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.640
checkered flags like you could be [ __ ]

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.130
go 100 percent keep yeah man and people

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.020
were just like yeah it's that's actually

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.940
true yeah she's just wrong just a dude

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.470
of lazy [ __ ] the particular expectation

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.170
to go oh yeah you should totally stop

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.490
what you're doing and get all particular

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.650
food on a moment's [ __ ] notice and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.900
it's like dude you're not in labor yeah

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.730
eat something else yeah but this they

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.210
they think I again I've never I can't

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.800
speak for sure what a pregnant woman is

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.660
going through here again they they

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.940
[Music]

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.560
literally think that they are actively

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.050
developing a child in them true you know

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.550
like they don't they don't think that

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.860
this is a passive process that is a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.390
biological thing that has happened and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.520
in them they think like I'm doing this

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.940
yeah I'm for unfortunate so like when

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.990
you're like you're not doing anything

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.090
it's a [ __ ] I'm fortune a baby

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.660
right now

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.160
well that's that's the other thing I

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.810
think they should and this is where this

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.030
stuff kind of gets mixed up for me

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.330
because it's like we should totally let

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.030
pregnant chicks chill it shouldn't work

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.920
they should go home they should relax

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.780
again there's people like well you know

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.250
people have babies and war zones it's

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.370
like whatever its sub ideal 100 was a

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.310
sub ideal dude to have someone like

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.200
pregnant and it's like the stress of

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.510
work it's [ __ ] bad it's a bad thing

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.790
to do there on the one hand it's like

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.980
I'm a woman do everything I can you know

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.450
do everything for me I'm pregnant you

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.310
should realize this and at the same time

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.710
like and I'm in no way affected

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.270
negatively by this process and I should

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.540
be able

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.160
do everything I want to do during this

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.360
time it's like you're asking for two

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.870
different things

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.790
yeah so I would like yeah you can't work

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.080
you're pregnant like your thinking is

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.670
all [ __ ] up they're just I'd be

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.530
[ __ ] slapped you live I'm like well

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.910
[ __ ] man up you're just pregnant you

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.860
get you know it's it's like well they

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.840
Ansley had a she knows she kids you know

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.550
she works in an engineering field

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.350
so she's with like construction dudes

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.580
all the time yeah so when she was

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.690
pregnant you know like [ __ ]

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.830
construction dudes they don't know how

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.750
to be around a woman yes like she's

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.490
pregnant it's like [ __ ] caterer you

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.880
know live in a blissful work-life yeah

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.770
well that's that's true and that's you

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.990
know that's how it should be but [ __ ]

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.900
man it's just like some of that [ __ ] is

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.590
just the expectation of like come do

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.030
this right now and it's dude if I wasn't

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.920
doing something I would go do it yeah

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.720
but it's like you have to you have to

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.950
chill but again it's it's you know it's

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.790
one of those things that's impossible

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.180
because if I took maybe to birth control

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.790
pills I'd be [ __ ] up you should try I

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.930
know what you do snorted them in high

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.910
school was he did he get all effeminate

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.770
but yeah dude it was uh yeah that's like

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.220
that's did it really it sounds so cliche

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.790
but idea the mood swings are just like

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.010
[ __ ] wild yeah so dealing with that

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.710
right now yeah man good luck I know I'm

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.560
there's no like it is funny so really

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.690
there's no it's just people laughing at

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.080
you yeah yeah that sucks

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.780
yeah write it all down you know to me

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.040
write it all down and then like when

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.690
she's not pregnant anymore and she

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.070
complains about the stuff you don't do

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.710
things like this is this is the [ __ ] I

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.140
did this is what I put up with yeah this

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.730
[ __ ] I did while I was also putting up

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.470
with how quickly they forget dude yeah

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.120
yeah that would be nice I might I might

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.860
start chronicling I've thought about

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.690
that before but I was like - that would

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.550
if you Khurana if you started being like

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.640
I never did that and if I have compiled

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.700
notes and I was able to like go to like

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.130
an actual yeah compilation of things

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.100
yeah it freaked it women hate evidence

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.080
true dude it's like it's like garlic to

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.940
a vampire with them yeah that's the

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.710
exactly view they like to stay in the

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.160
the

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.590
vague like remember no this was the ego

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.360
well no and they'll go extreme

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.670
confidence on the Vegas thing yeah

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.440
I don't think cuz I have like no

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.120
short-term memory so I'm in a total

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.980
disadvantage so I'm like I don't think

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.480
that happened I just have a sense like

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.490
now that and then like I'll find out it

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.170
didn't it's just like okay well whatever

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.370
you know sometimes making otherwise been

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.220
good though it really has it's just the

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.600
just a couple there's some surges every

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.800
now and again it's funny too because I

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.560
picked up the phone it was just like

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:12.360
hello yeah I had to add two pregnancies

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.830
so that I the second time around I was

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.570
like you know what like let me let me

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.970
see mmm let me see if I can't hurt to

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.530
this let me let me see if what happens

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.660
if I cater cuz it was I didn't know if I

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.010
was causing a lot of my own friction

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.050
yeah you know because I was I was just

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.140
like you it was like like I get it

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.370
you're pregnant but all of a sudden

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.750
you're not a high level athlete anymore

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.870
like you can't get up and do you know I

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.720
don't get what just happened you know

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.400
and I'm not talking about like nine

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.050
months pregnant I'm talking like three

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.040
four months pregnant

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.590
[ __ ] you know like barely carrying girls

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.260
is harder on body yeah especially when

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:56.430
you're carrying two two women in that

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.070
side of a space for nine months man yeah

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.200
not even close but no the first cuz the

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.700
first time around I was a little I was

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.890
combative I mean I'm not gonna say I

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.520
can't

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.380
in my mind say I can't let you think

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.430
that this is what its gonna be like

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.440
forever now that's my that's my thing

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.660
yeah I'm like I'm all about not setting

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.940
bad precedents always so that's the

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.190
thing that I've been I have to I've been

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.380
super like going with the flow with it

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.000
helping out doing my own oh my gosh you

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.750
gotta do it

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.250
yeah there's a certain thing of like

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.500
come to my job I have a thing against

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.240
dudes who go to their wives or

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.730
girlfriends jobs like I hate it yeah

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.230
I not even like like I'll go there and

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.580
bring her stuff but I used to work in a

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.169
pizza shop where a dude would sit there

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.640
the entire time his girlfriend was on a

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.469
shift yeah and I just thought I was like

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:38.969
- that [ __ ] hate the fact of this -

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:41.160
who's doing this dude it'd definitely

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.930
because it's like even if just like I'm

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.339
not trying to [ __ ] your chick I

00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:47.480
definitely am gonna flirt with her leave

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.070
you know

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.540
I'm trying to sharpen a skill too dude

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.790
yeah that's true and it's a good space

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.880
for a dude who's like like I would I

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.650
have and I could be wrong but I would

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.810
say like 80% of dudes are trying to

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.010
cheat on their girlfriends or wives

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.830
that's in my universe and my DC universe

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.720

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.370

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.100
chicks and pressing chicks and chicks

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.020
and pressing dudes exactly and they're

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.790
very exclusive I thought there's cool

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:50.410
chick there's like um there's the female

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.910
league of stuff no one ever talks about

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.000
is like like my my ex-wife would talk

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.830
about how her this is probably why I'm

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.660
[ __ ] up about it too yeah she'd be

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.940
like my ex-boyfriend would come bring me

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.250
a sandwich literally he would he would

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.750
be at the beach or he'd be at the beach

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.670
and I'd be here and I'd be like I want a

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.830
cheesesteak from where you're at bring

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.779
me one and he would drive all the way

00:12:10.779 --> 00:12:12.520
and bring me a cheesesteak yeah your

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.410
boyfriend was a [ __ ] and I heard that I

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.730
was like what a fine I would always say

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.050
to my the guy was a [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.310
like that's insane and then she was just

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.440
like well yeah and it's like just

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.390
knowing just sitting on a [ __ ] dude

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.520
she was sitting there watching TV and

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.660
she was like I can get this guy to

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.130
[ __ ] I can interrupt this guy's day

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.209
and have them bring me a cheesesteak and

00:12:28.209 --> 00:12:30.010
it's like that's something they brag

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.690
about - they'll just call their friend I

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.680
go what are you doing nothing

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.720
yeah Mike's bringing me a Chiefs a call

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.400
all the way from there yeah I can you

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.589
know he's coming dude and they then they

00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:40.000
start go they look at their boyfriend he

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.290
won't bring me a [ __ ] cheesesteak and

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.089
it just sets off this negative cascade

00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:45.339
no one ever talks about this dude no one

00:12:45.339 --> 00:12:47.290
talks about the female ego it's it's

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.860
it's toxic its brutal dude yeah it's so

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.390
it's so intangible that it's like like

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.580
if I'm like if I like the male ones

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.830
traditionally like someone in coming and

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.709
like it's like conquest and like

00:13:02.709 --> 00:13:05.140
domination the female ligo's exclusion

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.810
yeah so it'll be like we're gonna cut

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.209
people out of the circle and then just

00:13:10.209 --> 00:13:12.100
like watch as people are like

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.949
it's yeah that's been my thing in the

00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:18.759
theme of my video you 100% dominates the

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:22.180
world right because if I what dudes out

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.459
there what are their egos really

00:13:24.459 --> 00:13:28.060
conquest in four person right yes all

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.440
you're trying to achieve that's the

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.180
pinnacle to like you know like uh so one

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.440
of the reasons I really like the Ansley

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.389
when we first met you could just tell

00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:40.600
like like structure-wise her physiology

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.300
she was gonna be attractive her whole

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.769
life she's gonna be an attractive

00:13:44.769 --> 00:13:47.079
gray-haired old lady yeah you checked

00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:53.139
out the bones I think they're double the

00:13:53.139 --> 00:13:55.750
situation that's it would be a nice app

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.670
yeah I mean they kind of have that in

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.290
snapchat where you can see like old face

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.509
but if they could do like a timed they

00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:02.889
probably could do it probably we get to

00:14:02.889 --> 00:14:04.000
that point in the future where you can

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.470
do a genetic code and they can tell you

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.579
like this is what you're gonna pretty

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:08.589
much look like using your genetic code

00:14:08.589 --> 00:14:10.630
in your picture now they could probably

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.040
tell you I think they could probably set

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.019
that up in like five years just have it

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:15.850
like that if you if you could do that

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.180
you'd have you have the dating app of

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.550
the world like didn't nobody would go to

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.910
any other dating app but yours yeah just

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.459
like you could see because then you can

00:14:27.459 --> 00:14:29.500
really make a decision on people you

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.509
know you can also like it dude if that

00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:33.579
was on dating apps where it was like you

00:14:33.579 --> 00:14:35.500
swiped and it matched then you just got

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.259
to like DoubleTap their picture dude

00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:40.120
Italian chicks would fall dude you

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.800
double tap and they all look like cherry

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.899
bomb out a lot of it a lot of Italian

00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:46.470
chicks just go like turn to get like

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.420
why'd they just kind of like ball out

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:56.649
yeah Porto Rican stop Italians are

00:14:56.649 --> 00:15:01.089
Puerto Ricans every time they it's like

00:15:01.089 --> 00:15:03.189
the blueberry from Willy Wonka

00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:05.259
maybe the blueberry stuff and just like

00:15:05.259 --> 00:15:07.959
they just become very spherical yeah so

00:15:07.959 --> 00:15:09.250
yeah that would be tight I'm telling you

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.399
could do genetic code from ancestry.com

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:14.290
yeah and then double tap the picture and

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.329
they're just like that would be [ __ ]

00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:18.389
that's tough stuff although I have

00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:21.689
nothing but the utmost respect for

00:15:21.689 --> 00:15:24.939
someone who just shamelessly fat wives

00:15:24.939 --> 00:15:25.640
Oh

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.410
sometimes a big fat wife and is like you

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.120
know this is my I'm like I'm almost kind

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.880
of jealous that's such a sick [ __ ]

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.340
thing to have a big fat wife would like

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.350
to know that that's your thing and to

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.750
have it achieved yeah dude you know I

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.180
have lots of respect if you gave you if

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.920
you just like I say because you can't

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.450
help that dude that's going to happen

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.580
like again I've all I've said this

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.990
before chicks ultimate mission has

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:51.260
become fat and mean I've observed from

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.850
living with two women I've this is my

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.650
two women I've observed well I've

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:56.450
watched their dietary habits yeah

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.770
they're only ever eating the most

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.290
delicious stuff possible console

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.940
although you've shot that theory down

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.290
because yours do you guys have

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.850
attributed that kind of to maybe a

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:06.410
little bit of a racial it is a racial

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.940
thing but a lot of white shakes will hit

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.860
like plain yogurt and cottage cheese is

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.570
like so that's true yeah

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.700
but but that there is there is something

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.960
to be saying still want a [ __ ]

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.570
brownie there's a lot of statement of

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.980
the female population

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:23.150
just overall yeah that they do want to I

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.730
mean like women don't like restrictions

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.460
women don't like I mean accountability

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.350
is what it essentially is yeah right but

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.790
accountability to anything let me don't

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.070
want to have to eat healthy true that's

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.500
the noise so it's you know yeah all

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.810
women and then once they are no longer

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.390
like eating whatever they want like all

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.830
the [ __ ] restriction that they did

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.030
all that time all the eggs that they

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.590
have but I gain I'm gonna take it out on

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:46.040
people

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.190
oh yeah well I have a theory that I just

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.080
formulated that all women are okay with

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.890
slavery one yeah it's like I really

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.210
think if you were to pull them secretly

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.440
if you could do a truth detector a lie

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.240
detector and they it would come off as a

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.160
lot listen you be like listen I think it

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.540
was their idea yes silly hurry

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.910
any time you pay somebody they're like

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.790
how much you bein immune like dude relax

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.800
you really have slaves you know settle

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.470
this if if only you each state or just

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.170
tell you this are you doing if only you

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.440
had a slave though Oh like no woman is

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.680
saying no to that yeah dude yeah I you

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.220
could be like you know it in the slave

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.580
it could be your first ever female

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.240
exbest friend it's basically Game of

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.460
Thrones yeah yeah I mean she was like

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.050
you're free from slavery but you have to

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.030
basically do what I say that was

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.470
Daenerys and that ladies [ __ ]

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.909
the lady who was going after the D with

00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:42.679
no dong oh yeah yeah that was their

00:17:42.679 --> 00:17:45.230
relationship 100% she basically was like

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.780
you're free from slavery but uh their

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.540
slavery yeah you're gonna be my slave

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.559
[Laughter]

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:56.510
because I'm trying to find a play on the

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:01.179
word front of me it's like a slavery

00:18:04.659 --> 00:18:07.970
yeah I've like from being in school I've

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.159
observed a lot of women around food so

00:18:10.159 --> 00:18:12.440
during finals time and this makes no

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.169
sense dude so like imagine if like you

00:18:15.169 --> 00:18:17.539
were like we're mutually stressed and

00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:20.210
I'm like hey I baked us brownies for us

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.559
to eat to kind of take the edge off

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.080
you'd be like all right you ever hear

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.480
amazing brownies yeah they like bring

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.039
each other sweet food when they get

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:30.200
stressed about our finals which are

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.000
again the easiest dumbest [ __ ] things

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.190
yeah they like they congregate and

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.600
there's like all these little treats in

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.980
there and hey dude I'll be sitting there

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.840
like typing something up and now they

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.309
literally all come in and they see like

00:18:40.309 --> 00:18:41.750
a brownie or like some sort of granola

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.419
bar and they go what's this it's like no

00:18:44.419 --> 00:18:45.799
what the [ __ ] this is a [ __ ] cupcake

00:18:45.799 --> 00:18:47.480
you know exactly what this is you're

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.880
like you see me seeing you you have to

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.309
now start this whole process where

00:18:52.309 --> 00:18:54.350
you're like okay what's this yeah

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.150
it's a [ __ ] cupcake you're gonna eat

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.490
it or what what are you doing yeah I'm

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.630
trying to graduate I don't know how to

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.640
play this [ __ ] game now it was it's

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.049
like they had it's like as soon as they

00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:04.669
see it it's like they get hit with this

00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:06.710
you just pick it up yeah eat it though

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.409
like it sets off this thing they'll see

00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:11.390
you brownie like who made this I need to

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.789
make these for me every all day every

00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:16.280
day dude it's [ __ ] uh it's weird

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.750
seeing them interact with food is a

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.080
strange strange thing yeah it is I mean

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.409
like you know I'm healthy and my wife

00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:28.070
we're healthy people and when that girl

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.700
eats so much mayonnaise and butter yeah

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.150
it's not bad for you ah but we you know

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.799
she'll have a sweet treat here in there

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:38.929
like a lot of stuff is bad for you

00:19:38.929 --> 00:19:40.880
unless you start adding sugar to it

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.429
that's true that's too true that's true

00:19:43.429 --> 00:19:46.309
I mean you can eat the all meat diet and

00:19:46.309 --> 00:19:48.080
lose weight but if you eat all beef and

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.059
then cookies too it's like you I'm so

00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:51.260
[ __ ] fat

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.300
very quickly that's that's that is a

00:19:53.300 --> 00:20:00.200
black diet beef in cookies either

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.330
becomes super fat or is unbelievably

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.580
[ __ ] yoked and rift yeah it's one way

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.260
or the other well that we all start off

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:16.310
you that's Ronnie Coleman yeah

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.460
beefing cookies this is not damn but

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.470
yeah that was my damn that's been my

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.860
that's been the main it's been the main

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.210
aggravator for me and it's like dude I

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.890
try to be nice I'm not being an [ __ ]

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.690
but there are some things that are like

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.120
I get it you're [ __ ] pregnant it's

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.250
it's an amazing I have like a whole new

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.740
respect for like our relationship I'm

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.640
like this is crazy

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.890
we're creating a kid it really is like

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.660
in it's an eye-opening thing and you get

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.340
you you said this to me years ago and

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.590
it's like starting to kind of come true

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.840
the world sort of opens up when they're

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.790
finding out you're having a kid you it's

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.080
almost it's not like a secret society

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.790
but people start treating you

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.890
differently yeah and they like they'll

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.990
like like usually go to the doctor and I

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.880
got I'm here my foots [ __ ] up and sign

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.560
of paper we use like having a kid and

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.850
that person starts telling you they're

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.640
like kids stuff it's like an instant uh

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.510
it's an instant thing where you

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.950
empathize with that person so you find

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:11.030
out they have a kid you're instantly

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.710
kind of linked in a weird way yeah it's

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.870
like a fraternity it is dude you know it

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.180
is it's weird because like no matter

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.000
what no matter where you're in that

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.610
fraternity mm-hmm shared experiences

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.250
yeah if we know what this is yeah it's

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.930
crazy yeah it is pretty well it's also a

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.670
really perilous thing you're doing you

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:29.780
know what it means so like you're like

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.890
you see some houses you're doing this

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:31.880
student like alright cool and you're

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.920
like and it's hard to explain but I feel

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.480
like everyone there is like dude like

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.920
everyone we've come into contact with

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.380
with like different offices that they

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.150
all like have to relate therefore before

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.530
it's just like yeah Here sign this and

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.610
sit down and we'll call you and it's

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.760
it's really it's really strange it is it

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.770
is it shows you how nice people can be

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.750
because there's like once you're an

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.550
actual parent when you're about to be

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.380
parents yeah people people treat you a

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.080
lot differently then they treat you when

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.400
you're a person with kids right yeah

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.020
because depending on what your kids are

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.760
like my kids are amazing when we go

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.770
places and they impress people

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.090
these kids our kids are great it's like

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.220
yeah here yeah you know you don't see

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.490

conditioned to get up and move on

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:52.580
right if he starts hanging out with a

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.610

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.110
my wife was with her mom and my

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.299
daughters and like they're both seven

00:25:13.299 --> 00:25:15.399
you know they're boys they get a little

00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:17.649
a little bit of a longer leash you know

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:19.450
we're free-range parents I'm you out

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.570
there so and they wanted often like like

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.100
the other kid doesn't get that kind of

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.980
freedom Finn does yes so the moment they

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.649
got that kind of freedom he started he

00:25:29.649 --> 00:25:35.020
wanted to do crazy [ __ ] and and of

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.210
course like like I I can't let my son

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.159
know that I know that it was this kids

00:25:39.159 --> 00:25:40.960
fought I'm telling my son like listen

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.730
when this type of [ __ ] goes down you're

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.559
also you're an accomplice you're part of

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:46.299
the crime you're a criminal too yeah so

00:25:46.299 --> 00:25:50.500
but uh so he decided that they would go

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.299
to where the cars were leaving his park

00:25:52.299 --> 00:25:55.149
and tell people because there was a stop

00:25:55.149 --> 00:25:57.010
sign windows are down it's beautiful day

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.460
and tell people that they were poor and

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.240
needed money

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.909
[ __ ] yeah right yes so they were out

00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:05.649
there telling people to panhandling yeah

00:26:05.649 --> 00:26:07.750
they're paying him so far away from the

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.840
house was this I mean it was miles away

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.429
like they went and met them like it was

00:26:12.429 --> 00:26:18.669
like you know and yeah yeah yeah and you

00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:20.710
know you know my son was that insane was

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.510
like I didn't want to do it yeah you

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.299
know how much they get two bucks okay

00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:26.679
it's dollar each

00:26:26.679 --> 00:26:29.280
well it is a dollar each right

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.400
yeah so when they went back to when they

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.860
went back to their parents and told him

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.050
what was happening

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.490
his mom was like oh you can't be doing

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.500
that you know give me you know took the

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.710
two dollars what yeah and it's like I

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.660
get it like there's a lesson to be

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.580
learned here about all of that's mine

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.160
yeah that's a dollar that lesson is my

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:56.150
dollar like it should be coming home

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.380
[ __ ] dude I wasn't there though and

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.910
you think the mom masterminded that

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.570
whole scheme

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:11.430
dude she probably what kind of street

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.980
was a panhandling on it was it was the

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.630
parking lot of a park so it was as

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.330
people were leaving apart but the street

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.150
it was you know it was like an inferno

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:22.860
it's like two little kids were walking

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.020
around asking for money yeah it's like

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.910
someone was like didn't call the [ __ ]

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.430
cops yeah yeah well it was I mean it's

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.320
just not safe sure them to be doing that

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.110
sure you know any weirdo could like yank

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.000
them so yeah that's actually really

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.940
unsafe so I say that to my son I'm like

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.990
this is why since eight because anybody

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.310
in a van could just come and grab you

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.410
anybody in any car yeah could come if

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.420
they decide they want a kid today they

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.700
could just take your very easy yes if

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.870
you need a financially motivated

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.790
seven-year-old that's like the worst

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.880
thing you'd have roaming around yeah

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.620
yeah cuz you know that other kid would

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.180
have gotten into a car for sure it's

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.290
like well this I can give you two

00:27:58.290 --> 00:27:59.820
dollars now but if you get in my guys

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.750
would have more than two yeah yeah so

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.540
damn dude who's he said that was the

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.540
kids idea it was so where does a

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.650
seven-year-old generate that idea from

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.090
that's my question

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:15.420
well his his uh so the reason I gotta be

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:19.440
careful his mom is running for like a

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.010
political office ah and she's been going

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:26.430
door-to-door makes sense so he's he's

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.650
been seeing that and she's been

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.450
encouraging him to be able to go meet

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.220
people and stuff like that which is I

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.010
get it this is your life but he's a

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:35.520
child

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.880
ya know you can't you shouldn't

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.960
encourage him to do that now

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.790
yeah you know it's yes

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.890
that's why damn so he was out basically

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:48.580
canvassing yeah for money for donations

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.370
to get his mom elected yeah it's [ __ ]

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:54.130
crazy it is well thank God yeah I think

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.380
are they're fine that could have taken a

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.840
[ __ ] tough turn dude

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.570
yeah but I'm proud of my son for a

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:07.950
couple reasons so when the cops came the

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:14.860
he started hiding his clothes he saw the

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.410
cops going over asking different parents

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.930
questions yeah and he must have maybe

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.060
heard the description but like he

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.500
started trying like he got in a low

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.360
squat and he was like hiding his shirt

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.860
and he's like covering it with his arms

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.040
and his nod yeah and it was and she goes

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.940
up to my wife and she goes yeah have you

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.790
seen a couple kids you know one of

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.680
them's wearing a bright orange shirt and

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.200
she's like like that bright orange shirt

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.600
was you guys weren't that far they know

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.930
well he tried he was like he said he was

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.260
so I talked you know you had that let

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.110
mom deal with it then um deal with that

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.550
tell me the truth is all you tell me the

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.740
truth and after this we can we can yeah

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.750
talk shop right so we're talking about

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:04.180
it and he was going to run right I'm

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.560
actually pretty I was hyped on that it

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.870
he [ __ ] just booked yeah but so he it

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:10.450
was it made more sense he said to like

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.570
hide behind the equipment because if he

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.910
would have ran she would have seen his

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.280
bright orange shirt true yeah so I'm

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.560
like dude you [ __ ] thought that out

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.600
yeah it was the right thing to do that

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.890
you probably should have gotten on a

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.080
slide or in a tunnel or something but

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.730
you know what I mean I [ __ ] with it

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:32.650
yeah you try to disappear into the crowd

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:34.900
yeah yeah I tried doing that once like

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.790
completely ineffectively when I jumped I

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:39.430
was at a concert and I jumped down to a

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.350
lower level and then I was like I'll

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.610
just jump into the crowd and we'll

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.230
swallow me up and absorb me and I jumped

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.220
into the crowd and the crowd

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.440
we separated away from me and I just got

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.380
identified in typical that guy in the

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.390
middle of the crowd I think I also just

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.920
jumped into a bunch of people and

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.970
everyone's natural reaction was like oh

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.280
[ __ ] dude your maniac yeah I was follows

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.590
yeah I was zooming on a hat or all in

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:02.660
[ __ ] balloons and all that other [ __ ]

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.870
I was like doing nitrous oxide adderall

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:07.940
and smoking weed and I was [ __ ] up do

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.100
that jump was so much less graceful than

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.930
you thought it was oh dude it was like

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:15.170
it was base I probably fell I fell into

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.750
a bunch of people cuz I didn't jump down

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.000
and that jump was a lot higher than I

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.950
thought yeah so I was like shocked from

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.140
the jump thing people were like coming

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.160
to get me and I was like I'll just

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.080
disappear into this huge mass of people

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.360
and it was just like it was crazy to see

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.980
this crowd as interact that way and they

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:33.320
all unanimously they won't single me out

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.210
I'm like alright [ __ ] you guys dude it

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.770
would have been crazier if you would

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.240
have just slipped into the crowd

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.760
detected like if they wouldn't tell you

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.690
know what I mean if you would just like

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:45.350
pencilled oh dude they might make sense

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:46.700
but yeah that would've been insane that

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.380
would be crazy I think I've I've told

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.480
this story before I think I have when I

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.180
got uh I was at the Beastie Boys concert

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.810
when I was like 19 that was I was like I

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.480
was delivering beer at the time I

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.390
remember I uh I like I was I was working

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.800
late you ever like whenever like

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.330
specially like when I was like I was

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:06.890
like 19 I would drink a lot and like

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:08.210
your friends are already drinking and

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.500

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.160
work and I just like started pounding

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.810
[ __ ] beers and people had like the

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.660
nitrous balloons and I was like smoking

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.740

cannot handle stimulants dude I go into

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.480
full like manic mode like I just

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.030
instantly go into low mania basically of

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:30.980

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.190
exclusively on horrible ideas I'm just

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.080
like oh [ __ ] yeah and I get like total

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.150
motivation to carry them out yeah so we

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.890
went in that's pretty sick it's pretty

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:47.390
tight actually like don't let no the

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.040
last time I had adderall is in

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.540
Westchester when I was drinking on it

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.940
and I just literally saw a cup of soda

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.980
and it was like from a block away and I

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.110
just like owned in on it and walked up

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.280
and just kicked the [ __ ] out of it

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.050
before sitting there eating food I just

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:02.180
kicked their soda it was like I'm sorry

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.500
like I literally I was like I'd meant

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.660
nothing by it I just saw it there and I

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.090
kicked it was student so I guess I was

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.560
in the concert my brother like

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.150
we were sitting we're kind of close but

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:13.760
there's still like a level to drop down

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.680
and then go up and my brother left for

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.390
like five minutes and I was like dude

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:18.470
he's been gone forever

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.270
and I was like oh it was a moat and I

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:21.770
was like all I gotta do is jump down

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.840
there was literally it was a guy ten

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.090
foot drop then a moat full of security

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.490
yards and then there was if you climb

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.410
the rails dropped in I be on the floor

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.030
right near the Beastie Boys of all

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.710
[ __ ] people yeah yeah so I ended up

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:35.420
do it you know I jumped over got kicked

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.720
out went back in lost my shoe went back

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.940
into the concert with one shoe on and

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.420
then saw my friend getting kicked out

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.950
they mistook us so I was just like I

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.600
walked up I felt kind of bad about it

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.770
and then he saw me getting kicked me

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.600
back out so I kicked my other shoe off

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.030
and then I snuck in with Aramark workers

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.500
I definitely caught those before

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.270
snuck in with the air mark workers and

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.100
then crawled under the bleachers and a

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.600
guy saw me working walking down there

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.460
and I ran away climbed up the bleachers

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.160
and squeeze through a crack like a one

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.570
that would actually fit my head yeah

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.460
squeezed through and just emerged from

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.200
underneath the bleachers and away he was

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.130
like what the [ __ ]

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.620
nothing he'll relax and I just [ __ ]

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.810
watch the rest of the concert that's

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:16.490
that's like literally why I can't sit

00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:17.990
anyone I would've got kicked out and

00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:19.490
been like I'll just get the [ __ ] out of

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:22.070
here but I also had no phone on me yeah

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:23.960
and my uh my phone was dead I had no

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.370
money because I'd sweatpants on so I

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.020
didn't want anything in my pockets so I

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.390
was like just got to Philly didn't know

00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:31.429
my way around had no resources on me and

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:33.200
no sneakers on and I was like I gotta

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.940
get back into the concert dude you're

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.070
seeing this as I see this is a win I

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:39.740
mean it was a win it was a yawn like in

00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:41.899
that moment like you said in that with

00:34:41.899 --> 00:34:44.870
with no resources no shoes yeah you

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:48.190
still found the crack in the security

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.470
then I walked in with aramark since I

00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:53.630
had no shoes on I pulled my sweatpants

00:34:53.630 --> 00:35:09.470
over my feet I got right in and it was

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.780
like holy [ __ ] I'm down here on like

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.000
this I was where like I was close to

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.250
backstage where I was and I remember

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:18.530
thinking to myself like you just gotta

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:20.510
act like you're supposed to be here yeah

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:22.130
and I remember luckily I like I grew up

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.030
listening to the Beastie Boy

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:24.230
so I knew all the words and I'd walk

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.910
past people and I think I'm with the

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.650
band and I was like very confident about

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:29.420
being back there yeah and people were

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.630
letting me slide once I went under the

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.980
bleachers and I was in like the matrix

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.870
of all the weird [ __ ] stands some guy

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:37.430
saw me hit me the flashlight as I hey

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:39.050
and I was like dude you can't catch

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:40.460
someone back you know this stuff so I

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.560
[ __ ] security they never have they

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.900
don't have the right knees for that you

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.490
can't you know you can't catch a 19 year

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:48.380
old kid on adderall dude he's [ __ ] in

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.150
no shoes on I was like spider-man

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.410
dude I was climbing those little things

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.300
it was pretty [ __ ] wild I mean I see

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:57.380
all the different figure I tried the

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.080
first [ __ ] hole my head got stuck and

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.180
I gotta climb back down dude I did the

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.610
same thing at Live Aid I went down to uh

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:06.860

girlfriend who went down there and it

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:10.610
was the same thing it was a backstage

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:13.640
access thing and I was like we were both

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.740
drunk and I was like like they were

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.180
letting press through and I was like

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.410
we're with channel six and I said it

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:20.300
very like very seriously and very

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.340
sternly yeah and they were just like I'm

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.390
like come on seriously I don't have time

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:26.420
for this and like walked past I got back

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.480
there and I saw Rob Thomas from whatever

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.070
the [ __ ] he's from I always say Rob

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.290
Thomas from that song man was he in I

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.510
don't know music man so some Rob Thomas

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:38.780
is a guy from you do this song so smooth

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:44.450
with Santana he did that he had a band I

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:46.040
can't think of a few all me I don't know

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.260
what it was called but I saw Rob Tom

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.940
member walking past Rob Thomas is the

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.130
only person who was like kind of cool I

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.900
saw Chris Tucker and then I was like oh

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.490
hey you know I was in the area I was

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:56.870
supposed to be professionals and

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.580
journalist and I dig oh [ __ ] who's Chris

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.240
Duggar Oh Rob Thomas what's up dude then

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.460
like I watched Chris Tucker gave like a

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.050
speech to a bunch of people and then

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.530
like eventually I went to get like

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.760
directly backstage where people were

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.290
like so I could see performers and that

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:13.910
level of security I got snuffed out and

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:19.850
they kicked me out I know I'm very good

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:22.190
at reaching security yeah very good at

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:23.690
breaching security and also like

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.650
assessing loss prevention systems and

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.000
just completely taking advantage of them

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.680
that's pretty sick yeah but it's

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.450
dangerous dude like the self-checkouts

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:34.640
I've talked about that before yeah dude

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.490
I mean it was like I

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.770
literally scan all the options and then

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:40.690
simultaneously like what the actual

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.580
repercussions would be according to like

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.040
a criminal code because it's like it's

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.630
for Anna it's like I don't know how you

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.100
can't assume I know how to use this

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.830
machine yeah I can make a mistake and if

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:52.480
you bring it to my attention before I

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.160
leave the store that's not stealing yeah

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.070
I made a mistake that's uh I mean I have

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:01.180
I I have ways that I steal but I do it

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.540
at Whole Foods yeah yeah and I always

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.580
see here's my trick because they have

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.320
such an honor code at Whole Foods

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.640
yeah I almost feel bad it's such an

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.840
honor code because I used to pillage

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.119
them well you get the right person trait

00:38:13.119 --> 00:38:14.619
you build up a little little bit of

00:38:14.619 --> 00:38:16.270
relationships here and there and then

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:18.730
you know see I get oh use the small cart

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.350
and always put stuff on that bottom part

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:22.720
of the line oh yeah and I unload all the

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.580
stuff keep the cart close laundry

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.470
detergent is a good one a big fat

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:28.060
laundry detergent and target on the

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.700
bottom it's like 25 bucks dude what are

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.430
these ribs down there it's like oh the

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.940
meats a big I get away with it dude so

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.440
so what I do is I pay for all my stuff

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.580
and then I'm leaving

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.950
and then like I wait till the next I go

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:43.150
slow because I usually my kids with me

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:45.369
yeah so I like go slow and then what's

00:38:45.369 --> 00:38:46.750
the custom the customer starts getting

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:50.560
rung I go oh I'm sorry I forgot in it

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.780
but I got kind of don't make a big deal

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.250
out of it because I don't want the other

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.100
customer to to know what just happened

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.619
yeah I you know like I'm point down to

00:38:59.619 --> 00:39:03.130
the bottom and they'll either say oh you

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:05.380
can go to a different register or

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:09.910
whatever or they say oh just because all

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:11.830
in that moment all that cashier cares

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:13.630
about is the length of its line and they

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:15.280
this customer service and this person

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.930
not getting like jammed up yes if you

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.060
work on a register alright when I used

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.369
to do food you like that like the

00:39:21.369 --> 00:39:23.890
oncoming the onslaught of like oncoming

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:25.540
customers you feel that all that's like

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.550
a no load on your nervous system all day

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:29.650
long so you feel that when like when I

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.090
will be making food and like what are

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:32.710
like doing the registers when we're in a

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.030
lunch truck and you see a line of people

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.410
you're just absorbing all that

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.210
impatience the whole time so they're

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:38.500
doing that too and to them it's like a

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.720
quick easy decision is like [ __ ]

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.550
steak it's not it's nothing away from me

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.200
that's pretty ingenious cuz I'm all

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.050
about foolproof ways like that yeah and

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:48.910
that's what I see my thing is

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.100
so I've never been a good thief because

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.630
I just don't have the confidence for it

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.940
yeah I stole one time remember one like

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.710
those tiny keychains super soakers were

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.660
popular yes I stole one of those from

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.120
Brad like do I cuz I I used to do

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:01.840
sleight of hand

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.500

literally right in front yeah yeah I'm a

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.700
big fan at Home Depot we're like you get

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.170
a really nice paint brush and you just

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.790
leave it carelessly hanging out of your

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.230
pocket yeah it doesn't look like you're

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.400
trying to conceal it you're just like oh

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.440
[ __ ] yeah and then you let the beepers

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.180
go off and you stand there and you just

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.920
look at them like here's my receipt yeah

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.260
you're like here to look through and I

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.400
started digging through the cart with

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.810
them like what the [ __ ] is it yeah yeah

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:48.550
like I just get out of here yeah as most

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:50.770
those beepers are just a nuisance and

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:51.880
everyone's funny because everyone goes

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.620
oh and then you just you stand there and

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:54.940
smile and what the [ __ ] and then like

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.680
tear this so as long as you're cool it's

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.390
it's pretty it's a bad thing to teach

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.030
but dude the whole foods hot bar is the

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:04.840
most like they're [ __ ] up is doing and

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.490
this is this is where I'm like I kind of

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:07.690
hate myself because they're trying to

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:10.060
use like compostable biodegradable

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.280
material and in my head I'm like ooh

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.420
fifty dollar [ __ ] probiotics you get

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.040
a little brown box put a little bit of

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.840
rice in there yeah they dump that thing

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.010
in there so you just pay for the weight

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:26.260
of it rather you know it's $4 $50 but

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.570
it's like some people are trying to use

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.100
like earth-friendly material I'm like oh

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.290
that's perfect I can steal out or I can

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:34.930
steal Pro buy a certificate

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:37.210
yeah you got it man I ended up I saw I

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:39.430
had that Super Soaker for like three

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:42.040
days he came the keychain and I was

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.480
trying to I was spraying his chick and

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.190
she started running and like chaser a

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:46.720
little bit and I got tripped on

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.520
something sprayed my ankle so then I

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.820
developed this superstition immediately

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:55.300
immediately it's like I mean even back

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:59.170
then I was really high on myself from my

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:02.020
impeccable footwork that happened to me

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:02.470
of all

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.450
people it was like nah this is like that

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:07.330
was that was that was god yeah I took it

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:09.609
back I took it back there Bradley's yeah

00:42:09.609 --> 00:42:12.160
my religious code was strictly sexual I

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.109
would steal with impunity when I was

00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:15.580
little but I would jerk off and feel bad

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.400
for like six days a big [ __ ] some reason

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.890
stealing never like that never crossed

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.359
my mind I would steal stuff when I was

00:42:22.359 --> 00:42:24.400
little and just be like yes yeah and

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.349
like I would like jerk off in my

00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:28.720
bathroom and be like [ __ ] dude

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.099
it's coming for me cuz I was in Catholic

00:42:30.099 --> 00:42:32.410
school so I was being fully siapped yeah

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:34.480
on all fronts parent it's funny too

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.980
because even the whole concept of hell

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.530
of like where like the theory like the

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:40.960
Ferno after a wife comes from like Greek

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.970
and I mean I'm sure it comes from [ __ ]

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:44.800
before that but that's also present in

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.130
Roman and Greek mythology yeah yeah I

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:50.770
mean my my mom and my sister stole so I

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:57.250
knew it was like [ __ ] up yeah I know

00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:00.609
that's wrong you know yeah and yeah but

00:43:00.609 --> 00:43:05.470
it was again you know I I like to I like

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:10.599
to make people give me stuff yeah it's

00:43:10.599 --> 00:43:12.880
different yes see I like to see it like

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.099
I said when when the stores did the self

00:43:15.099 --> 00:43:16.270
checkouts it's almost more of a

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:19.030
curiosity thing yeah I'm like you know

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:22.300
like how is this how perfectly is this

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.430
engineered or is this how how much does

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.140
this depend on people's perceptions

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.030
where like if I'm just like jovial

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:30.339
moving around and if I act super

00:43:30.339 --> 00:43:32.619
confident well people think I'm stealing

00:43:32.619 --> 00:43:34.810
and it's like they don't know don't and

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:36.520
those systems are like dude one of the

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.400
classic the key ones is like you go in

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.619
Target you grab you know pop a couple

00:43:41.619 --> 00:43:43.089
price tag you look at clothes and pop

00:43:43.089 --> 00:43:44.530
the price tag off and you get a couple

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:46.510
high ticket items and then you just keep

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:47.980
that price tag in the cart so when you

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.450
lift it you grab the price tag and put

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:51.220
that over the barcode yeah you're

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.839
scanning it and then you just drop that

00:43:52.839 --> 00:43:54.250
little price tag and then here you can

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.450
crumple it up in your hand you put that

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.190
away so they're watching you scan things

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:58.720
yeah that's late Ain and it's pretty

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.280
late actually these big-time sleight of

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.320
hand you walk out and you're just like

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.660

like he's not a wolf he's a boy they

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:41.740
don't tell him he's a boy right just

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:46.030
like do it's like he was always like he

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.630

not worried about dropping the ball nah

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.720
give me this thing like that is your

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.400
ball you don't let anybody get this ball

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.320
yeah that's a huge advantage of like

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.060
there's not like what if I drop it

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.740
what's going on it's just like run as

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.510
fast as you [ __ ] can and all those

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:13.570
people and drew any get past them he was

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:14.170
a fullback

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:17.650
man who's a fullback perfect and then he

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:20.650
was a he was a wrestler but he he did he

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:23.320
was strong but he would get up against

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.880
people that were like way more skilled

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.330
than him sure wrestling

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:28.310
those things were like this the skill

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.230
you ensure it comes to a level like when

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:34.250
strength doesn't matter anymore so you

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:37.730
know so he did he used to get stabbed

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.160
all the time it was [ __ ] crazy he was

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.020
crazy grow your fullback in the world

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:48.050
there you'll end up getting you can't

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:51.160
all stop the world don't but uh so he

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:56.030
got caught stealing an apple [ __ ] from

00:46:56.030 --> 00:47:00.470
Walmart right and they caught him with

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:02.420
it he a call by like a Monsanto drone

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:06.490
[Laughter]

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.960
what's the penalty for Apple thievery

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.980
well he so look at stricter he so he got

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.870
out of the building like somebody came

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:19.070
at him you know yeah you stole the Apple

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:22.640
and he's a big guy

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:32.060
sure he ate the apple whole can't be

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:35.300
stopped do that's the other thing too if

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.010
you got the the [ __ ] gene you're

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:40.690
not scared of eating the apple core dude

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:46.060
[Applause]

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.280
crushes it basically he's forced to

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.270
[ __ ] Apple in front of loss

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:51.290
prevention yeah

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:53.600
also what sucks that guy to be like I

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.040
think I stole an apple you know I can't

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:55.700
damn it

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.700
yeah but he probably just chomped the

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.500
Apple that's probably how he eats apples

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.070
that you know to me that's like he just

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:05.630
started eating it from the top and his

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:07.400
Wendy just put the whole thing in his

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:12.490
mouth and so somebody what happens then

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:20.060
you gotta fight then put some more safe

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:22.130
really you'd have to like refer to like

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:26.120
the like the Koran in order to be like

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.620

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.120
then eats the Apple it's like well I

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:35.390

Yuri caught stealing and

00:48:40.369 --> 00:48:41.869

00:50:15.289 --> 00:50:17.630
good then yeah so my mom my mom used to

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:23.710
go up to Easton and train at like a box

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.660
yeah it was crazy so she would go like

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:29.930
and she would uh so my mom would I I

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:34.309
only saw a few of those fights yeah I

00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:37.309
see my mom get another like like fights

00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:38.839

00:50:38.839 --> 00:50:40.039
mom's like don't be don't talk to me

00:50:40.039 --> 00:50:41.779
like that yeah it kind of dysfunctional

00:50:41.779 --> 00:50:44.869
man in a bar yeah and I I saw plenty of

00:50:44.869 --> 00:50:47.210
those fights yeah

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:50.030
so with those fights it was I like once

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:51.170
the fight was on them they were like I

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:54.230
had no idea it was gonna be this and it

00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:55.580
was like people they're like okay I'm

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:56.420
stuck

00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:00.260
yes please and then but with the the I

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.390
guess the more sanctioned fights yeah so

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.940
I mean my mom would be out there and

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.670
she'd have like this super sharp boxing

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:12.560
form in like like sick jab right and

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.180
women that are like windmilling

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:17.230
ahead of her time way ahead of her time

00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:22.310
do is I mean I saw I saw my mom do some

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:24.320
impressive [ __ ] I wonder if that would

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.730
help girls to let them fistfight each

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:28.430
other I mean my mom was the most

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:29.810
confident woman I knew about to say I

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:31.100
think it would knock off a lot of the

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:33.380
dumb [ __ ] no not not at all now

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:35.900
you're right well then they can then

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.220
they can then after you lose a fight

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.870
they can then hurt you with a relational

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:41.630
aggression and then you lose a fight and

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:42.710
you get his back all to spread a

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:44.960
horrible rumor about her - my mom would

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.920
my mom would beat people up and then

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:53.180
talk [ __ ] at them forever damn she would

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:56.260
break people she people moved away

00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:00.200
because of her damn yeah she chased me

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:03.740
part of town she beat them up and then

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.140
bike just run them down today I beat

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:07.460
your [ __ ] ass I'll do it again

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:26.660
my mom is like although she was like she

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.060
was like since like Luther you're saying

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.900
she would talk trash she was closer to

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:36.500
smokey you know yes she was she was more

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.910
of a smooth operator which is kind of

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:39.890
devastating yes absolutely beat you up

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:42.560
physically then be able to mentally like

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.930
scorned you as well yeah that hurts and

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:46.940
she was like she had the Herstal her

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:49.700
style of fighting is dude this is like

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.620
fun to talk about I never I it's Finn

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:54.020
yes but this is a her style fighting was

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.750
like a mix between a Floyd Mayweather

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:59.360
and like any like one of those like Nate

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.230
Diaz a people I like

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:02.210
overwhelmed you like that Holloway max

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:04.160
Holloway but somebody who doesn't get

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.840
hit if she was a counter-puncher that

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.000
would go on very hard offensive sprees

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.040
as soon as like she would see you wilt a

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.940
little bit she picks up unless she was a

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.310
my mom was also a state champion in the

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:19.359
100 meter dash so she was like she was

00:53:19.359 --> 00:53:21.830
explosion yeah yeah yes so she was like

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:24.650
do I saw some [ __ ] man it's like Jesus

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:26.480
yes it's like she taught me how to box

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.520
like she's she she taught me how to box

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.310
and that's probably why I was like I had

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:34.010
an aversion to like fighting yeah cause

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:36.380
it's like she had me out so she would

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.510
take me out front and with boxing gloves

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:40.760
and we boxing and stuff and then like

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.200
you know people knew about my mom

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.660
fighting so like she was proud of

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:46.490
develop up like peers and so yeah so

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:50.270
then my mom would make me box the kids

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:52.850
that were why yeah so like work on the

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:55.430
[ __ ] we just went over and she'd never

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:58.970
put me with somebody my age yeah always

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:01.609
older kids yeah well it's like it's

00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:03.320
amazing how important that well I feel

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.440
like it's it's not anywhere near as like

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.270
integral to be able to be like fistfight

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:10.250
really well that was like a real point

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:11.810
of pride and like an important one too

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:13.400
yes if you're living in a you know

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.390
living there it's kind of quiet

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:15.619
someone's [ __ ] with you can go beat

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:17.810
their ass before like now it's like cops

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:19.640
lawsuits all that [ __ ] back then it was

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.720
just like someone came and beat your

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:23.300
[ __ ] ass yeah well see I was like I

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.130

00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:26.869
would have liked me to be yeah I mean I

00:54:26.869 --> 00:54:30.890

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:37.030
know like trying to like make me yeah so

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:39.470
that's how judo came in it was we had to

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:41.300
have a sit-down talk this is like a was

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:43.369

00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:46.910
want to fight you don't want to do this

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:49.820
no I was not fighting was not an option

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.310
yeah you know it was how she feel about

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:59.840
judo yeah it was like it was she was

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.700
like a little embarrassed that then I

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:03.500
was doing it she you were martial

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.760
artists you actually thought that I was

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.380
like she thought that it was like me

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:08.640
trying to avoid fighting yeah

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.070
you know I mean it was like you know but

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:14.520
which she didn't know it was like I was

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.990
gonna end up being a little bit of a

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:17.460
legend you know what I mean it was like

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:18.900
yeah and a little bit of a different way

00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.370
so we wanted you to be a classic brawler

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:22.440
yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I've never

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.440
got hit yeah you know it was and that's

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.510
one thing I plan I never started fights

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:29.700
either I was always a counter fighter

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.370
like people would so most of the fights

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:34.680
that I got in well because my mom beat

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.000
up somebody's mom yeah

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.460
kept talking [ __ ] was tearing their

00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:39.570
family apart

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.530
[Laughter]

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:45.600
the sons would just like start develop

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.370
or he's gonna fly me I mean that's like

00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:50.130
classic yeah that's like timeless yeah

00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:51.750
of course dude you guys are enemies you

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:53.610

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:56.340
like I'm gonna [ __ ] you up to you yeah

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.200
but my mom would always fight so my mom

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.300
that would work on me now yeah I was mom

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.830
started bullying my mom I would

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:03.840
instantly start like wanting to fight

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.180
their officers 100% but my mom fights

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:07.680
outside of her weight class so she

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.800
fights big bigger chicks so to have

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.710
bigger kids I mean it's like so it's

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:16.770
like the people she's beating up the

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:20.190
moms of the kids who everybody in the

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.470
neighborhood is afraid of [ __ ] you know

00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:25.830
so it's like stop it mom yes stop doing

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:29.250
that yes so it was yeah what stuff what

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:30.750
stuff the eggs ours were more like our

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:32.520
older cousins would organize us and make

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.290
us fight each other it was more for

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:36.090
their entertainment they like put on

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:38.100
boxing gloves we would fight somebody

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:40.140
would end up crying and then like we'd

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:41.430
all get a parents would they stop knock

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:42.780
that off yeah that was pretty that was

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:45.300
kind of the like we had boxing gloves

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.610
and older kids would organize fights

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:48.930
then as you got older and you had

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:50.280
younger cousins you'd make them fight

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.780
and they fight each other I would have

00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.910
loved that because I was like the only

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:55.470
one of my cousins that was living in

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:58.230
those project housing so I was develop

00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:00.270
in a different way than they were they

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:02.010
were soft as [ __ ] yeah you know what I

00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:03.510
mean I would have loved to be organized

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:05.910
like I would probably thought I was a

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:07.650
fighter I thought I was a boxer you know

00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:08.640
what I mean yeah if you were getting

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.410
forced to fight kids bigger than its

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:12.060
tariff yeah so I had a fight you know

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:13.710
I'd have to box my older cousins and

00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:15.540
it's just like just terrifying

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:16.710
I remember being little and being like

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:17.910
this guy's gonna hit me it's gonna hurt

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:19.860
I'm not going to win yeah this is not

00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:21.840
fun yeah it wasn't there wasn't like a

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:22.370
fight

00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:23.960
to be had it was just like I'm going to

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.790
lose this guy's gonna beat me up and

00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:27.230
everyone's cheering the song but dude

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:29.620
even the older kids outside of that

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.820
isolated neighborhood community yeah

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.650
they just looked different so I was like

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.870
if I was a feral kid to them you know to

00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:37.520
me so even I would have had no problem

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.080
with some of those softer older kids but

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.300
these are like I'm now fighting against

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.910
you know older kids who are forwards in

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:45.620
this [ __ ] environment yeah are you

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.180
kidding me who got like three years

00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:50.300
three years more of whatever dish is on

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.280
me yeah you know and that's with boys

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.110
it's like a couple years older than you

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:54.890
yeah different

00:57:54.890 --> 00:58:02.030
angry already like enjoying I think I

00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:04.580
think I I'm like had the kid filter or

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:06.410
like everything is kind of me it's weird

00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:08.510
that they're drunk like you know really

00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:12.230
interested in science and [ __ ] Christmas

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:17.180
you know fighting kids they're like kind

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:18.590
of paying in the chipping in on the heat

00:58:18.590 --> 00:58:22.850
bill kids come to school with like 10

00:58:22.850 --> 00:58:28.070
lunch pail that's terrifying

00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:30.170
yeah yeah it's terrifying they look like

00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:31.340
when I play baseball and there's like

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:33.380
the big kids who could throw like I mean

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:34.910
I get back then I'd swear it was like 90

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:36.140
miles an hour and really they're

00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:38.840
throwing like 14 it was like oh my

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:41.570
little II quit when I saw the kids who

00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:43.220
were throwing balls really fast I was

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:45.320
like I'm done I'm cool in baseball now

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:48.020
yeah I was I was not into that yeah yeah

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:49.580
that's terrifying is a little boy when

00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:51.560
you see bigger like kids who are going

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:53.390
to adolescence it's just like to [ __ ]

00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:54.710
with them physically yeah they're

00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:56.990
they're on a different gear yeah okay

00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:58.670
hold different gears so once you've

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:00.080
already felt their wrath - that's the

00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:00.440
other thing

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.880
yeah felt the wrath of someone who's

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:03.590
physically much bigger than you do I

00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:06.110
didn't [ __ ] I never even took a clean

00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:07.610
shot from one of these dudes but I'll

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:08.840
never forget this man

00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:16.220
it's um I think is Gilbert - he took a

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.060
swing at me

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:21.950
and I got just out of the way but I felt

00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:24.170
the wind you know what I mean and it

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:26.420
felt like so did here's how the best way

00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.890
to describe it felt like my wind was

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:32.350
like just and his win was like

00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:35.570
you know who's like hope like it was

00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:37.250
like the wind pushed me back a little

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:38.000
bit yeah

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.720
I didn't I there's no notice putting my

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:44.180
head completely 360 horrible idea yeah

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:47.000
so was that was that was a I was like I

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.860
gotta learn to something else yeah I got

00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.200
the switch to judo sick yeah one that's

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.030
so funny your mom's disapproving say

00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:56.840
this is [ __ ] gay didn't even know

00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.990
what judo was thought judo was karate so

00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:01.700
she she even told people that I did

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.290
karate she thought so she thought karate

01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:04.850
was gay yeah she just thought all of

01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:08.930
that yeah and what's MMA came around and

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.160
kind of show like karate is kind of

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.870
what's kind of gay you know that was

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:13.960
kind of the test yeah yeah right II was

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.490
there's the one nerd self-defense it's

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:18.980
the [ __ ] I never can remember the name

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:21.590
of it it's the one where it's just about

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:24.200
like evading attacks it's not you judo

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.310
you're like actually flipping stuff

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:27.740
that's the one it's not judo but it's

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.540
like an offshoot of Judo stock Kappa

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:32.030
where Aikido Aikido yeah Aikido is the

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:34.220
one that's like you know Aikido is the

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.270
one where it's it isn't it the whole

01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:36.530
idea of Aikido to like completely

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:38.240
neutralized and like not fight it off

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.680
well that's all yes but it's without

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.240
joking someone out or like [ __ ]

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.980
sewing up it's also with Steven Seagal

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.320
doesn't in his movie I saw him he does

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:45.710
Kido

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:47.690
he does Aikido so it's it can be a

01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:49.250
brutal it can be a brutal or but it's

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:52.520
supposed to be the the striking answer

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.650
the striking version of Judo so judo is

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:57.710
like the the reverse and your momentum

01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:59.780
and like taking you down sure and so

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:01.940
it's like all of those principles in

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:05.030
striking so it's like it's hurt you know

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:07.790
really like I mean their joint locks

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:09.500
gotcha you know what I mean and it's

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.690
like like a lot of throat chopping and

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:19.880
[ __ ] neutralizes like a quick quick I've

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.350
definitely been hit by nerds in high

01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:22.880
school and they always would give me a

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.190
quick shin kick and then like in a hard

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:28.310
L but like a [ __ ] elbow yeah they

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.290
find out they find a thing that gets

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:32.450
them all you know everybody has a thing

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:34.070
everyone has like a go-to thing that was

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:36.470
that was a funny thing to see growing up

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:38.720
the different kids had their like if

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.340
something goes down I'll just do this

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.500
yeah I was actually thinking about today

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.910
I was trying to think about

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:47.250
what would happen if you took a kid you

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:48.570
know I don't think anyone's ever done

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:50.640
this obviously but like if you were to

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.210
put a kid and like it totally uh they

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.500
might die actually I'm trying to think

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.940
but if you were to put a kid in an

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.190
isolated environment and let them kind

01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:01.260
you know you fed them you monitored all

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.010
their biological you know their needs

01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:07.440
and necessities and so that it's that

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.700
they didn't feel alone you were caught

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.110
you were communicating with them through

01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:12.150
like you know like all do you some audio

01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:14.130
components apparently that I think if a

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:16.560
kid never encounters like another person

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.870
during it's like formative attachment

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:20.160
years they day and up like going nuts

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.990
and freaking the [ __ ] out yeah but if

01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:23.940
you were to like complete so you gave

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.200
the person all they need it you gave

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.730
them all the instructions they needed

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:28.260
and like you were like there but not in

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.240
spirit you were just kind of like or you

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.590
were there not physically but you're

01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:33.030
like instructing them telling them what

01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:34.680
was going on have it narrating what was

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.900
going on and then seeing what kind of uh

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.690
what they what kind of like worldview

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:40.980
they would they would come up with like

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.270
what their mythology of the world would

01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:44.790
be interesting so what we are we talking

01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:46.350
about in a community or is this almost

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:48.120
like part like it's been the allegory of

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.270
the cave like the cave yeah I would kind

01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:53.220
of to have a kid in total darkness but I

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:58.610
don't know if they let you do this but

01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:00.750
that was like reading I was reading a

01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:02.130
book today about the origins of

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:03.360
consciousness and they went through all

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.370
of the different explanations like the

01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:07.500
first explanations like consciousness

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.210
comes out of matter and then there's

01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:10.620
like no consciousness comes out of

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.050
cellular organisms like no consciousness

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:15.060
comes out of learning and like no

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.950
consciousness is this weird metaphysical

01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:19.080
property so like then that I haven't got

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.880
into the meat of this book yet yeah but

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.770
in my head I'm like dude I wonder what

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:24.060
the [ __ ] would happen if you just like

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.610
let a kid in like a dark room and just

01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:28.590
like just see what the [ __ ] comes like

01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:30.210
what they started thinking of but you

01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:31.530
have to give them language because if

01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:33.090
you don't it's like if there's like a

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:34.560
window of you don't teach kids language

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.600
they'll be mute they'll just be I know

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.220
they'll still just make like the aunts

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.900
an animal noises I want to see it

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:43.200
because I feel like it would almost be

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.600
like competing with a foreigner right

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.160
because like you put them out into the

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.450
world I hope be American like he'll

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:49.770
speak English and stuff yeah yeah but

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:52.290
then like you can instill just values in

01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:55.920
them and like not let them see how even

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.390
though cuz you're stealing values and

01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:58.299
kids is

01:03:58.299 --> 01:04:00.009
you're grown-up but they're also seeing

01:04:00.009 --> 01:04:03.429
people like alive not living up to those

01:04:03.429 --> 01:04:05.199
values and ideals that you're instilling

01:04:05.199 --> 01:04:07.509
in them so it's like they start to like

01:04:07.509 --> 01:04:09.339
a la carte this [ __ ] you know I mean

01:04:09.339 --> 01:04:11.769
it's like well I don't have to I'm not

01:04:11.769 --> 01:04:13.989
the not steal I said the knocking call

01:04:13.989 --> 01:04:17.459
yeah you know what I mean so it's uh

01:04:17.459 --> 01:04:19.839
[ __ ] I lost my train of thought yes it's

01:04:19.839 --> 01:04:21.640
always a tough it's yeah I'm trying to

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.729
think I can capture this kid kids like

01:04:24.729 --> 01:04:27.039
them but you'd have to give them you

01:04:27.039 --> 01:04:28.150
have to give them something cuz I'll

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:29.709
just totally lose their minds or just be

01:04:29.709 --> 01:04:31.569
like the littlest revert into like total

01:04:31.569 --> 01:04:33.429
like and so if you're only so if you're

01:04:33.429 --> 01:04:36.489
givin them just the instructions on how

01:04:36.489 --> 01:04:39.099
to be I think they'll buy into it

01:04:39.099 --> 01:04:42.219
a lot more true in that environment so

01:04:42.219 --> 01:04:44.140
then you like release into the world so

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.519
let's just say what you're telling them

01:04:45.519 --> 01:04:49.329
is like even program them eventually

01:04:49.329 --> 01:04:51.189
you'll be out in society with other peer

01:04:51.189 --> 01:04:52.839
writing you late listen you gotta work

01:04:52.839 --> 01:04:55.900
hard you got a you know this only finger

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:59.219
Porto Rican chicks before they're 30

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.979
that's your thing when you get out there

01:05:02.979 --> 01:05:05.140
you see that highly respected way to try

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:06.729
to race I'm gonna be like happily fat

01:05:06.729 --> 01:05:09.009
white yeah that's the [ __ ] move dude

01:05:09.009 --> 01:05:10.989
I've always said if I ever came into

01:05:10.989 --> 01:05:13.809
like a real serious sum of money I would

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:16.689
pay a large fat Asian lady to drive me

01:05:16.689 --> 01:05:18.759
on a motorcycle everywhere that would be

01:05:18.759 --> 01:05:20.319
the first thing I would do if I came

01:05:20.319 --> 01:05:21.910
into like you know money where I can

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:23.469
arrange transportation I would do that

01:05:23.469 --> 01:05:25.660
and I would just [ __ ] just gripper

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.880
yeah I don't want to love her though I I

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.579
just I more so just one show off yeah I

01:05:30.579 --> 01:05:32.229
feel like I'll show off with her I want

01:05:32.229 --> 01:05:33.249
to get now I want to get like a vehicle

01:05:33.249 --> 01:05:34.929
that can like really like I so I'd have

01:05:34.929 --> 01:05:36.309
to get like a costume build motorcycles

01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:38.499
I'm going for like crane out I would

01:05:38.499 --> 01:05:40.569
basically maybe I'll get an asian lady

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.249
and I'll raise an Asian lady from

01:05:42.249 --> 01:05:47.319
infancy to be my fat I would disappear

01:05:47.319 --> 01:05:49.179
like anything I am God and then just

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:50.469
make her think the world is an illusion

01:05:50.469 --> 01:05:52.029
don't fall for any of it and have her

01:05:52.029 --> 01:05:55.719
dance for me around that transporter man

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:57.429
just like and I would just dude I would

01:05:57.429 --> 01:06:00.219
raise a fearless motorcyclist so I'd be

01:06:00.219 --> 01:06:01.869
able to like hold on to this like big

01:06:01.869 --> 01:06:04.029
soft fat lady and have her fly on a

01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:06.189
motorcycle I going that thing with a

01:06:06.189 --> 01:06:10.140
skid and go to the sauna understand

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.650
oh you sick

01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:16.329
yeah I've seen about the dude also in

01:06:16.329 --> 01:06:17.260
that book they're talking about how you

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.329
can cut a worm in half mm-hmm and it

01:06:19.329 --> 01:06:22.150
becomes two worms yeah that's crazy

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:23.890
that is pretty sick so I mean I know

01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:25.150
worms don't think about much because he

01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:27.069
was saying how like we project all of

01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:28.480
our consciousness that's why we think

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.400
animals have consciousness as we project

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.050
although with dogs I'm not convinced

01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:33.670
they don't have it but with a worm

01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:34.930
you're like you'll cut a worm in half

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:36.970
and like its writhing in agony but it's

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:39.130
like it's not technically what they say

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:40.750
it's not feeling anything yeah and if

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.099
you cut it in half you're actually doing

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:44.230
the worm population and the bird

01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:46.119
population in favor because if you cut

01:06:46.119 --> 01:06:46.900
them right in half

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:48.640
they eventually grow back and now it's

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:51.369
two worms so is that two distinct worms

01:06:51.369 --> 01:06:54.250
or all worms all the same thing so

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:55.450
there's like no distinction in worms

01:06:55.450 --> 01:06:58.630
basically so that is to say that worms

01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:00.430
don't experience consciousness of any

01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:04.300
kind yeah but that's according to what

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.880
if we if we haven't been able to define

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.230
consciousness can we really say that a

01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:10.119
worm is an experience in it that's a

01:07:10.119 --> 01:07:11.920
thing exactly yeah

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.540
but again if you cut a worm in half and

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.150
it's like [ __ ] ah and then it's just

01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:18.280
like now it's another warrant like the

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.650
worms [ __ ] each other or do they just

01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:21.970
like wait to get caught in half by

01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:25.810
shovels oh god yeah

01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:28.569
but I you like like a full a bird that

01:07:28.569 --> 01:07:29.920
didn't realize how fool it was until it

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.960
tried one extra bite it was like it

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.589
snaps away I don't want that if Birds

01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:37.030
were smart they'd eat half worm it would

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:40.000
just be never any yeah but maybe they do

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.339
like but like birds figure out some [ __ ]

01:07:42.339 --> 01:07:45.430
man like that's the thing so it's really

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:47.619
interested in how we try to say that

01:07:47.619 --> 01:07:49.119
different things don't experience

01:07:49.119 --> 01:07:52.390
consciousness yeah but then we see these

01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:53.740
animals like these creatures these

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.140
lower-level creatures they figure [ __ ]

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.760
out in their environment that's it and

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.020
that's the other thing too that like is

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.970
learning consciousness but then again

01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:03.790
there's so there's like you can have so

01:08:03.790 --> 01:08:05.950
you can teach like a dog like a or even

01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:07.930
a person you can have loaning lis like

01:08:07.930 --> 01:08:09.400
do like pavlo knee and conditioning to a

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:12.430
human to wear like a bell sounds they're

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:13.750
getting shocked and then they hear the

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:15.280
bell annoys us like that's learned

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.540
people say it's consciousness but then

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.469
there's a whole part of that where

01:08:17.469 --> 01:08:20.020
humans being like what the [ __ ] why is

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.730
this happening why is this happening I

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:23.989
mean maybe animals do that too yeah

01:08:23.989 --> 01:08:26.119
I mean is again it's like we don't even

01:08:26.119 --> 01:08:27.409
have like a working definition for

01:08:27.409 --> 01:08:29.119
consciousness in a conversation but if

01:08:29.119 --> 01:08:33.829
you have if you have a problem and you

01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:36.650
come up with a solution somewhere

01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:38.269
between there there was consciousness

01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:40.639
right yeah like not necessarily at

01:08:40.639 --> 01:08:43.339
point-a not necessarily at point B but

01:08:43.339 --> 01:08:44.349
in between

01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:46.159
yeah and that's where it gets confusing

01:08:46.159 --> 01:08:47.630
because people talk about that is

01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:49.130
learning and then the consciousness is

01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:51.949
more imagination the ability to be able

01:08:51.949 --> 01:08:55.130
to like understand the future different

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:57.589
phases of time all that weird stuff yeah

01:08:57.589 --> 01:08:59.989
technically you learn that but there's

01:08:59.989 --> 01:09:01.249
also you didn't do this stuff's like

01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:03.409
super [ __ ] complicated so I'm excited

01:09:03.409 --> 01:09:05.509
to read the book is apparently the

01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:07.609
writer posits a theory on where it comes

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:07.909
from

01:09:07.909 --> 01:09:09.440
mm-hmm and if he says it's from the

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.329

so the dweller on the threshold is this

01:09:48.199 --> 01:09:50.389
idea we're like and this comes from all

01:09:50.389 --> 01:09:53.119
these weird like alchemy occult things

01:09:53.119 --> 01:09:54.739

01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:41.869
a lot of this stuff is birth lined yeah

01:10:41.869 --> 01:10:44.360

01:16:57.139 --> 01:17:00.260
[ __ ] like that was my ethos carrying me

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:02.899
all the way through like my dude to like

01:17:02.899 --> 01:17:06.260
basically 28 mm-hmm so like I and I

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:07.820
wonder if chicks who can find out feel

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.919
that out because I never had like the

01:17:09.919 --> 01:17:11.689
offers of female friendship or the

01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:13.099
opportunity was always it would get

01:17:13.099 --> 01:17:14.410
muddled up with some weird [ __ ]

01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:16.030
yeah and then it was off it recently

01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:17.380
because I just I guess I don't put that

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:20.050
out really anymore yeah it's like women

01:17:20.050 --> 01:17:21.730
women want to hang around a tiger that

01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:24.880
doesn't want to eat him yeah you know

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:25.270
what I mean

01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:28.900
so it's like like one of the one of the

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:31.840
things or like even like in a

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.120
relationship like a woman wants what a

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.430
woman wants to want to be with the tiger

01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:40.090
she wants a killer that doesn't kill you

01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:42.670
know so it's like you know you you they

01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:45.070
want a guy that like you said it's

01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:46.420
desirable to other women like said

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.830
earlier like you know she calls her

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:48.910
friends up like could you believe he's

01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:50.080
being bringing me a cheese thing like

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.910
that so she wants a [ __ ] tiger to do

01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:54.070
to bring cheese steaks while they were

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:57.640
having fun somewhere that is the that's

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.140
when you get into a lot of like animus

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:00.640
possession [ __ ] we're like you get

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.080
chicks who like her just getting off now

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.090
I'm like boosting their ego by being

01:18:04.090 --> 01:18:06.130
like I'm commanding this dude rather

01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:07.330
than being like I had like there's some

01:18:07.330 --> 01:18:08.680
dude here he's nice we do nice things

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.990
it's like you have to then like capture

01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:13.300
and control the male spirit and then let

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:15.670
it show how much you do that it's it's

01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:17.800
kind of sick man it's much more of a

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.170
it's much more coveted for them to

01:18:20.170 --> 01:18:23.890
control like a guy like you then you

01:18:23.890 --> 01:18:26.440
know like it's [ __ ] Aaron Evans or

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:27.940
you know you know what I mean it's like

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:30.220
it's like did your win for them you're

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:32.320
you're you're a masculine like don't

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.270
trip don't tread on me tattooed on you

01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:40.180
some girls girls sees that tattoo and

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.990
she's that's a challenge to her yeah

01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:46.750
yeah well I mean it's what I what I've

01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:48.370
always experienced with dating is that I

01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:53.410
feel like women want to it's weird it's

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:56.170
like they want to get it do like you're

01:18:56.170 --> 01:18:57.430
saying like a dude who would like they

01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:59.440
think might who's not gonna like date

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.720
them and be like oh thank god I'm dating

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.980
a girl I'm so excited to date a girl

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:03.970
what do you want me to do that have a

01:19:03.970 --> 01:19:05.530
little bit of push back yeah you know

01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:07.090
and then but they want to eliminate the

01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:08.470
pushback but they also don't want to

01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:10.030
eliminate the pushback yeah yeah so they

01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:12.400
seek to eliminate the pushback it's call

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.810
it or like you not doing giving them

01:19:13.810 --> 01:19:15.360
their way every time they try to

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.650
absolutely [ __ ] that whole man the

01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:19.210
whole regime of that's you and you're

01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:21.190
like own independent personality it

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:23.680
seems kind of bad they'll try to like

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.690
you were your will

01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:27.820
I guess they try to like

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:29.829
take that out but as that leaves they

01:19:29.829 --> 01:19:31.659
start to like you less it's really weird

01:19:31.659 --> 01:19:33.429
they do that's the paradoxical thing

01:19:33.429 --> 01:19:35.130
about dating I found out that it's like

01:19:35.130 --> 01:19:37.630
just in any relationship it's like a lot

01:19:37.630 --> 01:19:39.520
of times I mean I just might have a type

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.270
- I don't know

01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:41.889
yeah a lot of times they try to like cut

01:19:41.889 --> 01:19:43.599
off the thing that makes you you that

01:19:43.599 --> 01:19:45.040
they originally they like they try to

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:45.820
stop dude

01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:47.260
I don't think guys you smoke weed it's

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:48.639
like I was smoking weed the night you

01:19:48.639 --> 01:19:50.349
met me yeah you know this this isn't

01:19:50.349 --> 01:19:51.429
what with Brittany but those other

01:19:51.429 --> 01:19:52.780
people being like I don't think I smoke

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:54.400
weed I don't and then like you would go

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.869
along with that a little bit or if it

01:19:55.869 --> 01:19:57.429
was like [ __ ] it and you know it's weird

01:19:57.429 --> 01:20:00.489
it's a very weird a yeah thing they try

01:20:00.489 --> 01:20:01.719
to completely deconstruct your

01:20:01.719 --> 01:20:02.920
personality and then if you actually

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.360
give in to it they're just bored and

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:06.880
they leave you yeah I found so I was I

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:11.349
was yeah it's like you can um it was

01:20:11.349 --> 01:20:12.730
easier I just learned how to be honest

01:20:12.730 --> 01:20:16.000
right yeah yeah dedicate you dedicate

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.710
your life to loyalty but if you're not

01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:19.270
being honest and you can't truly be

01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:20.829
loyal because you're always gonna cuz if

01:20:20.829 --> 01:20:23.560
I it's like I can't especially early on

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:26.020
when it was like so we were together for

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.190
so we've been together for like 20 years

01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:29.170
right and so for like the first six

01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:31.900
years we were young and you know I

01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:33.699
didn't know anything about being in a

01:20:33.699 --> 01:20:34.780
relationship you know I was still

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:37.360
cheatin and [ __ ] so but when we were

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:37.869
deciding okay

01:20:37.869 --> 01:20:41.079
the dumb shits over just put it on the

01:20:41.079 --> 01:20:43.150
table for a little while I had to be

01:20:43.150 --> 01:20:45.790
honest about like you know I saw a girl

01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:48.219
today typically I would have yeah

01:20:48.219 --> 01:20:50.139
try it you know and I really had to not

01:20:50.139 --> 01:20:51.909
yeah you know what I mean like she was

01:20:51.909 --> 01:20:54.670
giving me you know wasn't wasn't easy

01:20:54.670 --> 01:20:57.520
you know yeah I mean you were Christian

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.409
you would come and be like I wanted to

01:20:59.409 --> 01:21:04.329
bone but I did it yeah I had a good boy

01:21:04.329 --> 01:21:06.310
points to be like I wanted to [ __ ] this

01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:09.429
chick so bad yeah the SIOP dude yeah and

01:21:09.429 --> 01:21:11.860
it was like in you know I just want to

01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:15.010
throw anything mix more well you see now

01:21:15.010 --> 01:21:18.429
it's no it's gotta be it's gotta be from

01:21:18.429 --> 01:21:22.540
the other end because we're too deep

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.630
into a relation a for me to be like man

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:27.639
I've I've conquered that to some degree

01:21:27.639 --> 01:21:29.440
yeah I know how to handle that without

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.550
bringing her into the fold

01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:34.420
sure yeah so but what you can do now is

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:36.849
be like man there was a woman at a place

01:21:36.849 --> 01:21:40.480
that would not leave me alone

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.790
yeah it's like I get it I'm in shape but

01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:45.640
