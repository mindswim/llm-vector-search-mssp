the galaxy dude it's just [ __ ] like

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.759
weird [ __ ] lesbians with like blue

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.199
hair being guardians of the minorities

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.560
and they top out of a thing like get in

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.840
the [ __ ] dude they didn't like that

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.600

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.680

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.759
joke saying like paula dean got fired

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:51.759
from saying the n-word so long ago or

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:52.960
whatever he's like everyone says yeah

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.560
this is just something no no let me tell

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.720
it so that's not just

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.879
so

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.360
so like paul teen

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.599
it's funny to me that like when

00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:09.199
like paulding got fired for saying the n

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.960
word like 15 years ago or whatever

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.479
that's the gist of the joke that's i

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:13.840
don't think that's a cooking show that's

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.280
not exactly what happened no she didn't

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.879
say it on the cooking show

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:18.479
i think she was having like a sweet

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:19.759
potato i think she was having like a

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:21.520
slavery themed wedding or something

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.520
insane i don't know the actual the

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.440
actual reason i don't know okay but for

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.199
the joke it's that paul dean said the n

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:28.879
word 20 years ago she just burnt

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:30.960
something and yelled it and uh

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.039
i was just like it's funny it's just

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.880
funny that white people are like yeah

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.200
that's a fireable offense for sure and

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.200
it's like oh is it white people yeah

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.560
like if you're getting fired for saying

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.560
the n word 20 years ago

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.760
pretty much every white person is

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.440
getting fired and then the joke is i

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.519
would be fired and i'm 29 yeah which

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:50.160
means i said the n word when i was nine

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.839
and there was this lady

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.600
that was sitting in the front that's my

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.760
point sour [ __ ] there's a white lady up

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.160
front being like sour puss in behind her

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.399
a row of like four black people howling

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:03.120
laughing yeah exactly that's the [ __ ]

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.440
that's what i [ __ ] want

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.000
entirely is for these white [ __ ] up

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.519
front to be like i can't believe he's

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:11.440
saying that because they don't get it or

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.360
they don't know like she said that she

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.920

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.839
indian arabian boyfriend

00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:19.120

their girlfriend

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.880

i mean that's hilarious it's just a

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.520
hilarious way to handle an argument

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.280

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:22.559
trading black miles for [ __ ] axe

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:24.880
but uh the south is like

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.360
they have a they have a swoop their hair

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.760

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.880
down

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.320
yeah they're weirder than that pretty

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.559
boys they'll wear

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:35.360
with

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.240
button-down shirts and then short shorts

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.559
like pastel colored short shorts and

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:41.760
boat shoes

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.120

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.679
[ __ ] sweatsuit like yeah i gotta get

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:48.320
the [ __ ] out of here dude i when i was

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.880
down south suck when i got a taste of

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.679
the dudes down south of like i was

00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:55.679
unaware of like country music culture

00:20:55.679 --> 00:20:57.120
yeah and like you would be at like bars

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.960
and stuff they do karaoke and like a guy

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.240
would come up and sing country karaoke

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.080
which is dude if you're going to be like

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.320
and they they will go up and be like i

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.760
don't know there's a thing in like the

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.360
south cowboy culture where it's like i'm

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.520
the roughest tumblest wild man you ever

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.760
did see this guy would sing a song and

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.480
like

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.360
dude

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.720
and they were like hot they were these

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.000
hot guys

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.240
karaoke country and i'm like dude

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.679
these guys are [ __ ] doris but it was

00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:24.000
cool down there it definitely is weird

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.679
it was almost like asian culture where

00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:28.240
like you try it karaoke

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.600
you know i think that ties back into

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.280
your theory about england how like

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.280
english dudes are so weird because

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.320
there's not black people chatting you

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.000
need black people to check this i think

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.919
it is kind of really separate down south

00:21:37.919 --> 00:21:40.000
still so white guys can go like if there

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.760
was karaoke in philly there's going to

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.440
be a couple black people there and if i

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.559
go sing like [ __ ] burke williamson or

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:48.640
whatever whatever country music guy and

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.840
off they're like nah i'm not rooting

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.320
this teariness and if you spit in my car

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.679
i'm gonna spit the backer and it's like

00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:57.919
oh my god while i said hey pretty lady

00:21:57.919 --> 00:21:59.600

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.400
rode downtown and i fingered her [ __ ]

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.000
it's like dude

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.520
yeah you need black people to keep you

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.039
in check you need a cooler that's why

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:08.880
[ __ ] conor mcgregor thinks he's floyd

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.919
mayweather

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:11.840

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.159
mean

00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:35.919
but i'm irish mayweather's a piece of

00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:38.880
[ __ ] so he's an [ __ ] but it was just

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.919

00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:41.280
black people i'm like god damn it

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.640
actually you know what it's that is a

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.080
sick move though he is a piece of [ __ ]

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.120
but i think

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.360
we do we do throw that around quite a

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.960
bit what

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.320
someone tells a piece of [ __ ] someone's

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.320
always evil someone says the worst i

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.559
don't know we never really say evil

00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:56.080
evil because i'm saying that piece of

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.360
[ __ ] it's like

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.960
yeah maybe he pushed his girlfriend the

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.720
same way that kid did did he oh

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.480
mayweather pushed a couple girls he got

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.559
in trouble for it yeah except he was not

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:05.840
just pushing

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.280
he's giving him some [ __ ] little

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.280
giving he gave him the johnny gage split

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.360
punch to the [ __ ]

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.840
mayweather's on the record as throwing a

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.919
couple combos at least wow

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:17.919
yeah i'll be i'll be he

00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:19.600
screamed [ __ ] at the last press

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.520
conference so he's allowed i'll be

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.600
curious on the totem pole

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.679
yeah well dude that's guy worth 400

00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:29.679
million dollars is worse than gay people

00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:31.919
he's low he's he's higher on the you

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:33.200
think it's because i'm total money he

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.720
has no no but i'm just saying it's

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.760
ironic that he's considered a victim

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.559
socially while he's worth 400 million so

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:42.080
he's still allowed to say [ __ ] and

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.080
have 500 million dollars yeah that's

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:44.880
true

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.159
it's funny too because i was talking to

00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:48.000

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.240

a little bit you're having sex you hold

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.000
the butt and you go spread it out and

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
they go oh when you go you like that

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.599
sometimes they do that or sometimes then

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:43.119
you push outside of the ring you go like

00:37:43.119 --> 00:37:44.400

touching your butt if you ask to touch a

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.640
butthole the immediate answer is no but

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.240

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.320
