00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.119
of having us step one yeah it's one of

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.360
the harshest side effects sourpuss he's

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.460

keep it up nothing was fine nothing's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.090
funny when you got a hemorrhoid oh man

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.369
nothing's funny nothing nothing's funny

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.810
at all do you have anything stinks

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.550
you're sitting on like a painful golf

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.289
ball dude it's nothing in paint

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.620
nothing's funny you know Oh

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.659
[ __ ] message you about was it a Hemi

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:14.920
or was it something else

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.310
thrombosis or some I don't know I just I

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.959
stopped so I'm looking at that thing was

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.299
I've never seen a Hemi like that if that

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.459
guy's right which I think he might be if

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.470
you've never had a hemorrhoid yeah and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.590
then you just got that thing yeah right

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.970
I think there's then there was

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.409
definitely like three doctors who were

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.319
just totally wrong which is very doctors

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.269
a lot of times don't give a [ __ ] no no

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.920
especially when I my health insurance

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.579
show you have health insurance and they

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.049
would like bring it bring like a nurse

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.940
and be like yeah you check this guy's

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.579
[ __ ] like literally pull my pants

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.200
down right there yeah whatever

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.480
whatever it is call back yeah call us if

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.769
anything happens and if anything doesn't

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.209
happen you say whatever yeah I wonder if

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.620
there'd be a difference in how they

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.230
treated it Hemi or thrombosis or

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.299
whatever that was I'm sure they

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.859
literally were just like it we could

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.239
call it whatever we want imagine your

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.680
doctor who's constantly coming and

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.030

girl issues in Louisiana when he went

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.110
like pouring out to see him because I've

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.560
vampires to go down to you guys roll

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.760

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.290
[ __ ] it's the original family these guys

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.510
are [ __ ] bad itself you got so much

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.920
vampire so she wouldn't get anyone

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.150
watches a vampire so if y'all think

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.760
you're the only one can almost guarantee

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.860
all of our listeners you're the only one

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.430
who watches not true dude so tick-tock

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.230
bad boys out here there's a big time

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.240
putting in the fangs getting ready dude

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.160
it's my favorite part of vampires oh

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.170
dude I can't get over that wouldn't move

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.350
real fast oh yeah when they just yeah

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.170
that's [ __ ] why somewhere when they

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.330
drive too sometimes just occasionally

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.310
the wheel always driving like Porsches

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.750
and [ __ ] I wonder if it's exhausting

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.400
the flying around they never seem

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.050
exhausted so they should be doing that

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.640
instead of driving making like a

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.990
dramatic blur and getting out of there

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.340

00:18:59.809 --> 00:19:02.090
of the mentally handicapped and disabled

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.729

00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:12.609
that's terrified no no it's not [ __ ]

00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:14.989
I'd be you get really good you are

00:19:14.989 --> 00:19:16.759
getting nudged by a backhoe although it

00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:18.769
is funny you know we get nudged by like

00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:20.389

00:19:26.119 --> 00:19:27.289
flying Oh

00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:29.599
so same thing same level of power

00:19:29.599 --> 00:19:31.940
exactly both a million horsepower for

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.929
sure tiny guy with Down's it's at least

00:19:35.929 --> 00:19:41.029
80 horsepower easily easily so basically

00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:42.080
this is where you could read an ad

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.019
whenever we flat it's like alright [ __ ]

00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:45.229
it

00:19:45.229 --> 00:19:49.190
my question is so you stopped you had

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.389
the panic attacks and you're like you

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:51.879
know what this is not for me

00:19:51.879 --> 00:19:54.249
yeah I'd rather do it though cuz ever

00:19:54.249 --> 00:19:55.690
thought about coming back on the horse

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.009
yeah yeah because I've been off booze

00:19:57.009 --> 00:19:59.619
like with the recent you know sort of

00:19:59.619 --> 00:20:02.319
arthritis flare-up I got off booze I

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.450
from day one his name was Marion Francis

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:05.570
Marion good bull showed us what was up

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.490
yeah he started guerrilla warfare in

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:09.470
them unless it's so funny they all stand

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.910
in a straight line on their knees like

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:11.900
that's not fair

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.450
what is this gentlemen don't fight from

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:20.450
the trees very ungentlemanly all right

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:21.170
you got me

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:22.610
yeah that's someone got like a hard

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.740
choice and more frightened Indian /

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.420
revolutionary you like that Warren

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.190
Indians [ __ ] sit that's when they

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.110
love good colonial powers fighting it

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:34.120
out just like fighting over like Ohio

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:37.640
yeah like that sick that's so funny hire

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.590
Indians to go [ __ ] kill the other guys

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:43.360
now is a huge power up - yeah what I

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.920
mean being a French gentleman running

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.410
into like some Iroquois Oh cut your

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:50.880
[ __ ] head off how it suck

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.939
[Music]

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.620
let's go Davey Kirby's so yeah we were

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.610
playing wiffle ball

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:02.150
I love wiffle ball that it can't put any

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.340
little pebbles in the ball no sure see

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.240
when someone gives you a little funny

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.460
ball yeah well knuckleball you throw a

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.450
little you can put a little something in

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:10.880
the ball dances only a little

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.160
yeah little drop-down on Rizzo County

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.570
pitching and you were just batting it

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.790
out of the park we were switching that's

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.160
nice yeah nice how many strikes I'd love

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.110
to see some shirtless strikes some

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:22.580
shirtless wiffle ball strikes hard

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.080
pretty accurate but the problems my

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.760
technique is terrible so I'm like

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.980
working on cuz I kind of like whip it

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.350
from that here why you're the wild thing

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.960
as opposed to got you yeah you got a

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.010
real tight tight release I do I do

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:43.220
so who won if somebody went yard once I

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:48.540
did make a contact

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.589
[Music]

00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:54.159
SiC is at the end you start dialing

00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:56.110
inside you were dealing though there's

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.529
nothing you could do about it you were

00:30:58.529 --> 00:31:01.509
what about frisbee so I mean Little

00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:03.100
League you're picking your spot so you

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.330
were [ __ ] climbing the ladder

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.750
throwing him sinkers

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.630
he got up to play a little too close he

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.409
said back off that's my plate put him in

00:31:17.409 --> 00:31:19.720
the dirt he fell down his helmet got

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:27.009
back up so Dan how many with a chick the

00:31:27.009 --> 00:31:33.929
chicks had to be flocking masturbating

00:31:34.139 --> 00:31:36.730
it would I when I was a pitcher in

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.049
Little League so it was coach pitcher

00:31:38.049 --> 00:31:41.289
than the first kid pitch yeah I was

00:31:41.289 --> 00:31:43.779
deadly I made the league all-star game

00:31:43.779 --> 00:31:44.889
okay

00:31:44.889 --> 00:31:48.100
I take quite well and then the next year

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.889
I just got lit up and when you look at

00:31:50.889 --> 00:31:53.440
the footage of me throwing a ball and

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.549
the reason I think it was so successful

00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:56.409
I was accurate but I was just throwing

00:31:56.409 --> 00:31:57.970
like a crescent moon because I was

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:06.309
throwing him so slow I thought I was

00:32:06.309 --> 00:32:09.940
wait and then it's just like this like

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.110
Ron Gardner and Rookie of the Year

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.850
you're just floating it at the end I

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.500
guess yes great reference yeah you're

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.809
just doing [ __ ] javelin yeah it's a

00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:20.860
nice little parabola and then what you

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.360
started trying to sling it in there and

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.440
you start getting rock no no maybe maybe

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.519
the other team's got the footage that

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:29.320
happens a lot yeah I think they study

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:29.919
the tapes

00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:31.750
usually here too like if somebody is a

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.730
good receivers a quarter like first half

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.200
of the season usually the tape gets out

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.940
and defenses catch up okay I think

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.080
that's what happened to you in Little

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.029
League I think the other team started

00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:42.190
studying your films yeah we can hit we

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.519
can hit this guy yeah I could see that

00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:46.269
what do you think you were throwing like

00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:53.139
20 miles now you were slinging it at the

00:32:53.139 --> 00:32:54.789
vet you were trying to get velocity so

00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:56.799
you're also catching some of that 9.8

00:32:56.799 --> 00:33:00.309
m/s^2 with the way down yes yeah that's

00:33:00.309 --> 00:33:01.740
how we just died

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.710
catching that gravity dude Wow your

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:07.530
dive-bombing that's that's crazy through

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:10.290
32 I could have been older when that was

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:13.580
tested I mean that's so that's fast

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.530
32 is it would be difficult to throw

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:24.390
that slow [ __ ] school zone they'd

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:26.730
write your ticket true it's double the

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:30.330
school zone speed limit I can't throw a

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:31.679
baseball let's say well I could throw

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:35.429
more than 32 maybe 40 till you can throw

00:33:35.429 --> 00:33:39.020
Tommy yeah of course how fast you throw

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.210
you could probably hit I mean Tommy

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:48.679
emits 90 played baseball forever

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:53.150
[Laughter]

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:56.880
I bet Tommy could hit 80 80 somebody

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.160
gets thrown the 70s yeah you can [ __ ]

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.640
that's heat yeah you toss it up high and

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:12.210
have it sink down he though no listen

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.040
the park throwing [ __ ] wiffle ball

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.200
well how the frisbee go frozen is good I

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.250
mean O'Connor

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:20.159
he played lacrosse and so he's like very

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:23.369
athletic and yeah those two definitely

00:34:23.369 --> 00:34:27.149
go hand in hand when I see a lacrosse

00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:34.020
player I'm like definitely an athlete so

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.240
I was having trouble just like you

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.290
inches taller you could have played a

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:40.109
real sport could play football you know

00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:41.909
but it was great because I just like

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:43.109
throw it as hard as I can they're just

00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:45.179
running after it really your [ __ ]

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:50.340
treat him like a dog well no I can't I

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.810
can always curve the frizz I can't get

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:52.830
that thing to go straight well that's

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:54.359
because it's a ladies sport trails

00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:58.140
ladies and evil hippies sport sport of

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.690
cure no people play disc golf I do

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:04.230
Chris O'Connor yeah he's got some evil

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.720
head being him yeah if you play back you

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:11.820
really can't help it they're like the

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.670
pinnacle of evil heavy you're right

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.319
pinnacle oh you taught him at lacrosse

00:35:16.319 --> 00:35:19.079
lacks bros you're running risk they do

00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:21.359
run the same definitely sex without a

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:23.490
condom in terms of an evil hippies but

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:27.329
sick evil yeah but don't work on them

00:35:27.329 --> 00:35:30.089
evil hippie Empire that mean at its

00:35:30.089 --> 00:35:32.460
source is like Disco Biscuits I mean you

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.500
could end up yeah it's a gate it's a

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.420
portal for sure yeah supporter one of

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:37.859
the many portals actually that's that

00:35:37.859 --> 00:35:39.119
isn't offshoot people don't talk about

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:42.569
that the blacks are evil hippies yeah

00:35:42.569 --> 00:35:44.250
tend to be super-chill but there's a lot

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:48.030
of date rape yeah they do get I mean

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.549
it's very public that they're rapists

00:35:50.549 --> 00:35:52.920
true but probably that's probably the

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.140
most rape every sports across I would

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.440
argue football man yeah that's true I

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.119
guess the in the arena of sports pretty

00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:02.670
well football yeah I just don't think

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.140
you should get the bad rap that it does

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.900
because to me it's like I love catching

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.069
popups and it's like catching a

00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:14.040
horizontal pop up if you like tracking

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.690
the ball and like yes any anything in

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.119
this one it's just like run full-speed

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:22.980
track in this thing I'd love to put

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.690

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.559
yeah of course it's the best you're like

00:37:13.559 --> 00:37:16.470

time we got into a little bit you've

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.920
been getting some head getting getting

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.200
something yeah a little bit that's tight

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.030

guy who could not faster off head yeah I

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.960

the head real quick you gotta be kind of

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.100
stupid a lot like the feeling I get when

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.870
I'm high is very similar to when I'm

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.000
getting head really I'm like this feels

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.590
good but also I'm in my head the whole

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.170

of them are [ __ ] stuck too

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:52.490
because the electricity yeah like [ __ ]

01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:54.170
you works with electric you're supposed

01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:55.250
to have someone with a piece of wood

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:56.990
like a two-by-four on you because then

01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:58.100
if they get hung up you can just nudge

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.480
in with a piece of wood or you hit them

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.650
on the head and knock them out and then

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:04.550
they they let go yeah that was to keep

01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:06.050
the two boys working people in it I was

not someone the [ __ ] pop on the head or

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.630
just push them off of it because it

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:12.560
won't travel through the when you

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.600

84 did a pro anti-trump they were

01:20:11.679 --> 01:20:14.860
anti-trump which is kind of surprising

01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:16.400
yeah that's weird

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.659
oh they also might be tied in with like

01:20:17.659 --> 01:20:19.190
the unions and stuff problem is a pretty

01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:23.719
anti-trump good dude roll them up dude

01:20:23.719 --> 01:20:28.969

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:36.320
what do jjz unions right although I

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.489
thought Jays were Bolsheviks and

01:20:37.489 --> 01:20:39.080
Bolsheviks loved unions this whole

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.380
thing's confused dude being a bigot is

01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:44.260
[Laughter]

01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:49.060
from what I've understood that the Jews

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:51.520
push the plain little both sides

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:55.070
Bolshevism to create social unrest to

01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:58.719
then the flames little playing both sigh

01:20:58.719 --> 01:21:01.340
yeah Jays are using that Russian

01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:03.260
playbook of just like make them fight

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:09.710
each other we don't know just that it

01:21:09.710 --> 01:21:12.830
doesn't allow for a lot of error

01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:14.869
correction sometimes yeah they were good

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:16.070
when they came out really hard to get

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:17.780
rid of bad stuff that's going on there

01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:18.969
yeah

01:21:18.969 --> 01:21:21.320
yeah that's the yeah I don't know [ __ ]

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.150
about unions yeah they're pretty bad man

01:21:23.150 --> 01:21:24.920
they were good back in the day back when

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.020
like people how to work like 14 hours

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:31.280
yeah it was your [ __ ] 11-year old

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.450
show up for work today and you're like

01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:36.050
yeah sorry I'm gonna rape your wife yeah

01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:37.910
so they came out they were good and like

01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:39.500
all other human organizations they fall

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:42.320
into state of more human organizations

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:46.000
we think about organized religion I

01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:51.650
don't hate you do hate God

01:21:51.650 --> 01:21:54.650
I don't hate God it doesn't exist so

01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:59.260
there's nothing to hate okay so I think

01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:02.300
I'll state my idea here which is that

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:05.090
tell you what God doesn't like panty

01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:07.730
jobs all those dirty games you've been

01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:15.770
playing God doesn't have sex what are

01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:18.800
you stupid true that he doesn't have sex

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.110
but he's not asexual yeah he [ __ ] me

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:23.000
straight exactly but he doesn't [ __ ] you

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.530
can we [ __ ] as much as he needs to God's

01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:27.130
definitely straight sure all right

01:22:27.130 --> 01:22:31.670
some would state your position appeals

01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:33.860
to the supernatural is what I reject and

01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:36.590
the reason for that okay and that could

01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:38.750
come in different only you had the power

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:40.490
to reject it but go on what do you mean

01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:43.430
it's in building you it's like a you

01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:45.530
know like sea turtles when they they get

01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:48.350
laid in the sand and then like they come

01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:50.150
out and gotta do a mad dash the ocean

01:22:50.150 --> 01:22:51.440
for they're scared all the predatory

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.660
birds they come out in grain you could

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:55.340
take a baby turtle and paint a picture

01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:57.140
of a hawk and there's like dangle it

01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:58.430
over its head and it'll like try to take

01:22:58.430 --> 01:23:00.440
cover and hide from it okay what is

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.360
inborn thing that you you can't escape

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.600
so if you take that energy out of what

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.220
you call God you just put that same

01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:09.340
energy another thing you just you know

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:12.560
but you're saying so the idea that

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.390
there's an ingrained thing in me that I

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:16.760
can't escape but I think we do escape

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.560
that constantly we kick away the

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.780
evolutionary ladder and so far as using

01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:23.080
protection when we have sex

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:26.420
what know it there you believe in God in

01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:28.280
use Conant we don't know because your

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.570
argument is that there's an ingrained

01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:32.750
thing in me that I can't escape yeah my

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:35.420
genes have given me a mental state and

01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:37.700
then I'm unable to you'll deify one

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:40.400
thing or the other yes no no we don't go

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:40.940
to the DF

01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:42.920
I think I just want to disagree with the

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:45.140
premise what's the premise that my jeans

01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:47.930
are going to cause me to think certain

01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:49.850
things and I can't escape that can I say

01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:52.730
something in this because you're you

01:23:52.730 --> 01:23:54.290
made Matt's argument with your condom

01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:56.449
argument go ahead because he's saying

01:23:56.449 --> 01:23:58.820
you're gonna you have in your condom an

01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:00.890
argument condom argument is that you

01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:04.219
want to fill up a vagina with [ __ ] so

01:24:04.219 --> 01:24:05.510
you're taking that energy way and you're

01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:08.150
just filling up a condom with [ __ ] exact

01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:09.370
that's all he's saying with religion

01:24:09.370 --> 01:24:12.710
like you want to believe in God you want

01:24:12.710 --> 01:24:13.460
to come in a [ __ ]

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:15.320
and then you're like I want to take that

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.550
energy somewhere else you end up just

01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:24.140
nodding in a [ __ ] condom throughout

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:28.190
history that we like what like burning

01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:32.690
cats for fun people still do that

01:24:32.690 --> 01:24:34.370
constantly not in this country

01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:38.890
[ __ ] Avery did it and making a murder

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.920
that the extent of cat burning parties

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.710
is Laura that there are human behaviors

01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:51.980
that we decide to change sure so yeah

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.410
and you think we I mean religion not

01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:55.910
necessarily religion but believe in God

01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:58.250
has been in every single culture in

01:24:58.250 --> 01:25:00.280
every like what are you talking about

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.540
well of course it has but there's all

01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:04.460
different hat burning wasn't there's all

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.650
different types of God exactly built-in

01:25:06.650 --> 01:25:08.719
it's built into the human structure it's

01:25:08.719 --> 01:25:11.180
come out supernatural same types of gods

01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:13.880
and God figures have spread across all

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:16.580
the civilizations that's why people

01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:18.350
think it's an inbuilt mechanism coming

01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:20.330
from like the substratum of your

01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:22.130
perception this is being your you got

01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:23.449
your thinking on a conscious level but

01:25:23.449 --> 01:25:24.949
you don't you're not need like thinking

01:25:24.949 --> 01:25:26.630
about the stuff that's occurring below

01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:28.130
that that's where it's popping up to

01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:31.100
your conscious thoughts okay so now you

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.489
worship Mars

01:25:33.489 --> 01:25:36.140
you went from worshipping the Sun is

01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:39.980
stupid I worship Mars don't blame the

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:41.750
worship you dirty [ __ ] all about the

01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:49.640
[ __ ] III lost my train of thought there

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:52.640
I guess I guess the the general idea

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.950
here though that you

01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:56.650
can't escape this idea of like you're

01:25:56.650 --> 01:25:59.170
saying it has to be a deity and what I'm

01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:02.470
saying is that you can escape ideas like

01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:04.210
that that's actually what makes humans

01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:06.460
so unique what about it's that we try to

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:08.620
come up with explanations for reality

01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:11.950
okay that no other animal does and so it

01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:13.660
makes sense that we would come up with

01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:15.910
the idea of a deity and all different

01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:18.280
types of cultures would come up with

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:19.630
their different forms because you're

01:26:19.630 --> 01:26:22.090
trying to explain what's going on mm-hmm

01:26:22.090 --> 01:26:25.180
but then around we we we now realize

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:27.520
that good explanations and bad

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:30.700
explanations differ in particular ways

01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:32.470
like good explanations are hard - very

01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:34.300
bad explanations are easy - very and one

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:35.800
of the reasons are the supernatural or

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:38.200
appeals to God as bad as because you can

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.090
vary it as it has been done with

01:26:40.090 --> 01:26:42.310
Poseidon or this God or any different

01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:45.670
type of God and in general my problem is

01:26:45.670 --> 01:26:47.320
when you appeal to the supernatural and

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.210
this could also be it doesn't have to be

01:26:49.210 --> 01:26:51.360
religious it can be scientists do this

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:54.100
when they would say there are some

01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:55.540
things we'll never understand

01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:57.700
right so there's an appeal to a

01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.140
supernatural thing that there's things

01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.370
that we'll never understand them hmm

01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:01.960
that you're essentially putting a bubble

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.300
around human knowledge so it's like The

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:05.770
Truman Show where there's just this

01:27:05.770 --> 01:27:09.010
limit and then the problem with that is

01:27:09.010 --> 01:27:11.380
that everybody is gonna claim to have

01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:14.080
hit that limit at some point yeah and if

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.430
they're in power then you're you're in

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:17.380
trouble that's the end of progress sure

01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:20.170
and so that that's again where I would

01:27:20.170 --> 01:27:21.910
say that my position is I just reject

01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:26.230
appeals to the supernatural that's fine

01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:27.280
I mean that's fair enough

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.770
but I mean yeah I mean anyway yeah you

01:27:29.770 --> 01:27:31.150
could say that but there's also you can

01:27:31.150 --> 01:27:33.520
reject appeals to the supremely

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:38.410
objective sure sure can you can you

01:27:38.410 --> 01:27:40.570
clarify what supremely objective we mean

01:27:40.570 --> 01:27:42.100
just being like it's all it's science

01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:43.900
this is proven by science Bob at some

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:45.430
level it does break down and just kind

01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:48.790
of yeah yeah I think that's a bad way of

01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:51.460
going about it that people do nowadays

01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:56.530
that they're like yeah yeah did they

01:27:56.530 --> 01:27:58.090
think philosophies dead

01:27:58.090 --> 01:28:01.290
mm-hm and they think science is this

01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:04.870
this thing exactly it's like infallible

01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:06.610
when really the whole thing of it is

01:28:06.610 --> 01:28:08.169
that it's fallible but

01:28:08.169 --> 01:28:11.590
you know what so yeah I think it's a new

01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:13.809
religion that's all okay can't get away

01:28:13.809 --> 01:28:14.289
from it

01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:17.439
scientism is a thing yeah and I agree

01:28:17.439 --> 01:28:18.399
with that but that's not my position

01:28:18.399 --> 01:28:21.010
you're og popper yeah yes yeah you're

01:28:21.010 --> 01:28:22.449
popper yeah yeah that's sick

01:28:22.449 --> 01:28:25.360
what you think about that Shane I think

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.749
the Vatican has some good scientists

01:28:27.749 --> 01:28:32.949
well why because it's the same thing

01:28:32.949 --> 01:28:36.189
it's that the Vatican claims certain

01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:37.929
truth it claims the final answer but the

01:28:37.929 --> 01:28:39.429
role he knows where the edge of that

01:28:39.429 --> 01:28:41.949
bubble is I think those scientists would

01:28:41.949 --> 01:28:45.309
tell you they don't okay I think they'd

01:28:45.309 --> 01:28:47.590
be very open that they don't okay

01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:49.869
what about Tommy acquaint Tommy

01:28:49.869 --> 01:28:51.219
acquaintance you'll prove good boy don't

01:28:51.219 --> 01:28:52.599
[ __ ] come down look I'm just saying

01:28:52.599 --> 01:28:54.820
there's we got half a J in here trying

01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:59.260
to tell us God's dead very Bolshevik God

01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:01.030
look at the cultures that haven't had

01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:04.479
God how are they doing well I don't

01:29:04.479 --> 01:29:06.610
think they're not what they're not

01:29:06.610 --> 01:29:08.169
chillin dude well I don't think that's

01:29:08.169 --> 01:29:10.659
fair to say not chill I mean we we have

01:29:10.659 --> 01:29:12.550
the separation of church and state here

01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:15.669
and we're doing Purdue e yeah one nation

01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:18.669
under what that was added when we were

01:29:18.669 --> 01:29:22.869
fighting the kind all the J's were

01:29:22.869 --> 01:29:24.340
trying to be that God's not real God's

01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:29.229
dead yeah is another example of somebody

01:29:29.229 --> 01:29:31.510
claiming to know certain truth about the

01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:32.709
world it said how do you organize

01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:35.079
political and economic institutions this

01:29:35.079 --> 01:29:37.780
way it's perfect you cannot challenge it

01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:39.519
and then of course what happens right

01:29:39.519 --> 01:29:41.139
because they'd say this is gonna lead to

01:29:41.139 --> 01:29:43.719
a utopia yeah you want to challenge you

01:29:43.719 --> 01:29:45.999
topia you're getting in the way of it so

01:29:45.999 --> 01:29:47.889
then what do they do to you kill you

01:29:47.889 --> 01:29:49.030
really put you in a war camp

01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:52.059
so there's appeals to certain truth or

01:29:52.059 --> 01:29:54.189
final knowledge is what I'm just oh for

01:29:54.189 --> 01:29:57.489
sure 1% right that's why I push back in

01:29:57.489 --> 01:29:59.860
science doing that but you're right

01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:01.899
here's my question I know you didn't

01:30:01.899 --> 01:30:04.119
call immigration talk yeah what was your

01:30:04.119 --> 01:30:05.289
what was your overall stance on

01:30:05.289 --> 01:30:05.919
immigration

01:30:05.919 --> 01:30:09.579
well that's changed recently and keep

01:30:09.579 --> 01:30:11.260
him out David to which I thought I made

01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:12.999
a great point about this what what did I

01:30:12.999 --> 01:30:15.280
say about it he said that well he would

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:17.439
agree with the general idea that we you

01:30:17.439 --> 01:30:19.389
know we want to create as many Western

01:30:19.389 --> 01:30:21.760
Minds as possible in degrees

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:25.090
we're dangerous this is a Hellenized the

01:30:25.090 --> 01:30:27.010
world best way to do it but critically

01:30:27.010 --> 01:30:31.000
we can't hate ourselves so in the West

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.119
we cannot be so self-loathing less we're

01:30:34.119 --> 01:30:37.570
not able to convince people of like the

01:30:37.570 --> 01:30:39.730
force than to assimilate culture not

01:30:39.730 --> 01:30:41.889
force but they do it on their own here's

01:30:41.889 --> 01:30:45.250
here's Microsoft with the like global

01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:47.739
poverty numbers no it's like I think

01:30:47.739 --> 01:30:49.989
three three billion people or in like

01:30:49.989 --> 01:30:51.610
less than two dollars a day okay

01:30:51.610 --> 01:30:53.469
I think another two or I'm glad poverty

01:30:53.469 --> 01:30:55.239
so the majority of the world is like

01:30:55.239 --> 01:31:00.309
super poor right mm-hmm so if we were to

01:31:00.309 --> 01:31:02.530
westernize all of them and they were to

01:31:02.530 --> 01:31:03.880
live like the United States and the

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:05.829
Western the world would explode there's

01:31:05.829 --> 01:31:07.179
no way the world can handle everyone

01:31:07.179 --> 01:31:09.579
living like that well why do you say

01:31:09.579 --> 01:31:11.619
that third if everyone was like

01:31:11.619 --> 01:31:13.630
generating as much trash as us all

01:31:13.630 --> 01:31:15.219
throughout if you took we have three

01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:17.139
billion people who are primarily

01:31:17.139 --> 01:31:18.369
responsible for like a ton of the

01:31:18.369 --> 01:31:20.230
pollution so if we were to triple our

01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:22.449
the population people who live like us

01:31:22.449 --> 01:31:24.130
yeah maybe five Indians started

01:31:24.130 --> 01:31:31.539
podcasting dude here's what I would

01:31:31.539 --> 01:31:33.190
disagree with that just philosophically

01:31:33.190 --> 01:31:35.500
sure which is that that locks in our

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:37.150
current state of knowledge and then just

01:31:37.150 --> 01:31:39.099
runs the clock forward with population

01:31:39.099 --> 01:31:40.840
and wealth growth but the whole thing is

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.329
that you don't know you can't predict

01:31:43.329 --> 01:31:45.070
future knowledge and so people have done

01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:47.800
this a lot Thomas Malthus was the first

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.900
yeah and then this other guy I forget in

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:51.880
the 70s he was a he wrote a book called

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:53.380
the Population Bomb I think was Erlich

01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:55.210
and he said there's no way we're gonna

01:31:55.210 --> 01:31:56.320
feed all these people

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.179
hmm we're literally just there's gonna

01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:00.340
be mass starvation and death and then

01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:02.110
Norman Borlaug was a scientist that

01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:03.760
figured out how to create a genetically

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.590
modified wheat crop yeah and it turned

01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:07.150
India from a place that was going to

01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:09.849
have massive death to a net exporter of

01:32:09.849 --> 01:32:12.579
wheat in like a decade and net exporter

01:32:12.579 --> 01:32:15.090
of dm's

01:32:17.219 --> 01:32:21.460
food and they need the Bob so I think

01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:23.980
you weren't trying to he you're not

01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:25.599
saying that they need to be westernized

01:32:25.599 --> 01:32:28.480
in consumer like consuming [ __ ] they

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:29.739
need to be westernized in the white

01:32:29.739 --> 01:32:31.599
man's way of thinking which is what

01:32:31.599 --> 01:32:34.110
Steve wants

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.730
I am and for Bob women deserve equal

01:32:37.730 --> 01:32:39.230
rights although all the white man's

01:32:39.230 --> 01:32:41.540
thoughts white men hate women three no I

01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:47.150
mean the westernized minds coming on

01:32:47.150 --> 01:32:48.380
board would be the greatest thing to

01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:50.660
ever happen on the planet because all

01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:52.760
the problems that you are articulating

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:54.860
would probably be solved by them the

01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:56.780
only thing that we know in this universe

01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:58.340
that's capable of solving problems as

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:00.080
humans mm-hmm and we know how that

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.580
happens is through trial and error

01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:03.890
correction and there are cultures that

01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:06.140
explicitly inhibit that through

01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:09.230
corruption like Islam yeah you think

01:33:09.230 --> 01:33:12.890
your Sam Harris guy you hate Islam does

01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:14.660
either but I hate the aquatic Monarchs

01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:16.730
yeah I love Islam and you just said you

01:33:16.730 --> 01:33:26.270
loved monarchs so chic

01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:30.110
give me a good salt what about what the

01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:32.030
hell is going to say and let me just

01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:33.500
clarify it doesn't guarantee that we

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:36.130
would solve that problem but yeah and

01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:38.360
problems are inevitable so we want as

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.830
many oh that's what I stand dude I'm

01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:42.620
saying we in order to do that we'd have

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:43.880
to like you'd have to get rid of like

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:44.660
the will money

01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.640
put in all clean energy in order to

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.810
actually do that you'd have to have

01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:50.180
total clean energy otherwise winter is

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.800
coming someone hit me you received

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:53.960

the guy does jars yes going like the

01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:56.720
population

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.120
yeah dude winters [ __ ] coming yes

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.070

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:07.370
extreme poverty they just disintegrate

01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:09.950
for like decades the diseases and [ __ ]

01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:11.560
coming out of that are gonna be horrific

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:14.090
that's why we need to make them as

01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:16.130
wealthy as possible skip it if you've

01:34:16.130 --> 01:34:17.660
been under the current system of welfare

01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:20.030
the world would explode unless we go

01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:22.580
full solar full everything agreed but we

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:25.010
can do it herbs okay

01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:28.370
bust it out oh it takes it takes getting

01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:30.290
is any people working on the problem as

01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:32.300
possible yeah if it's not happening well

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:34.190
that's that's where we want to inspire

01:34:34.190 --> 01:34:36.170
our culture to understand what makes it

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:39.470
great again there's not self-loathing

01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:40.520
well you trying to make America great

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:46.890
again still I'm very great still

01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:49.800
just have like a high mind but you're

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.450
still like a white you're like a white

01:34:51.450 --> 01:34:55.470
supremacist David Deutsch isn't David

01:34:55.470 --> 01:35:02.400
Duke still what more immigrants you want

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:08.750
more immigrants to act white Western

01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:17.700
Jews pull their pants up take off those

01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:23.400
flashy shirts yeah I mean that's what

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:26.430
the prow boys say yeah like everybody

01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:27.900
can be a problem with their Western

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:31.350
chauvinists yeah yeah I mean I don't I

01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:33.210
don't know what the proud boys say or

01:35:33.210 --> 01:35:35.700
stand for me what I do with them okay

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:38.130
your promise pausing their beliefs I

01:35:38.130 --> 01:35:39.900
don't think that they would want more

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:42.690
immigrants here they do okay they do

01:35:42.690 --> 01:35:44.880
yeah boys love him against if they start

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.170
acting AK and white

01:35:46.170 --> 01:35:48.840
yes I act in Western Western European

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.370
that's the that's the only thought that

01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:52.530
matters well let me ask you this like so

01:35:52.530 --> 01:35:54.510
would you want somebody here that was

01:35:54.510 --> 01:35:58.800
like you know the to told you there's

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.920
certain things you couldn't say you mean

01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:11.970
like self loathing that's a

01:36:11.970 --> 01:36:16.590
self-loathing so everyone I run into it

01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:20.640
is bad so we need to get rid of 23 year

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:21.840
old white chicks you know expel them

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:23.910
they actually do fantastic over there

01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:27.330
they would love like autocratic rule it

01:36:27.330 --> 01:36:29.190
is it's really upsetting to see when you

01:36:29.190 --> 01:36:30.660
see that because it's there is an

01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.790
incredible thing going on here that it's

01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:34.560
still like in London not not that I'm

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.570
taking Trump's position here but London

01:36:36.570 --> 01:36:40.560
has the things they're like well good

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:44.040
music London has a thing where they're

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:46.830
you know call police if somebody says

01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:48.720
something that offends you it's like

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.520
that's a real thing that it's going

01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:52.290
around of the cops like that guy got

01:36:52.290 --> 01:36:54.390
arrested because he taught a they call

01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:59.350
you a Daffy con vinny it really it's not

01:36:59.350 --> 01:37:01.600
he called the bubbies someone just

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:09.850
called me a racist it's like the culture

01:37:09.850 --> 01:37:13.590
someone called me a [ __ ] Gabi cow

01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:16.870
bubbies call the police and someone

01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:18.550
called your name must be so [ __ ] for

01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:20.980
what is it's like they gonna be anything

01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:22.630
or you just can't lace but it's probably

01:37:22.630 --> 01:37:24.610
mostly against pakis you slurs they

01:37:24.610 --> 01:37:26.500
[ __ ] talk [ __ ] on pakis I didn't know

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:28.240
that was a bad word dude [ __ ] I said

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:33.580
that one time so easy I think it was

01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:35.230
that one guy I knew was from Ireland he

01:37:35.230 --> 01:37:36.400
was like all my neighbors are [ __ ]

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:38.380
[ __ ] you know I was like that's a cool

01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:39.700
name for people from Pakistan I said it

01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:41.890
to you on time oh yeah you got you don't

01:37:41.890 --> 01:37:44.410
do it no no it's not it sounds kind of

01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:46.630
nice [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah until you're

01:37:46.630 --> 01:37:48.490
[ __ ] some Irish dude screaming a

01:37:48.490 --> 01:37:51.220
muscle from like Jordan's face yes

01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:54.150
[ __ ] [ __ ]

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.670
London definitely being racist against

01:37:57.670 --> 01:38:00.360
Muslims J's it just raises or if you

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:04.180
know I mean a [ __ ] comedian in like

01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:06.640
Canada got arrested like there's some

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:09.220
free speech issues that uh that the

01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:10.570
probably is like Steve are fighting

01:38:10.570 --> 01:38:16.330
against and that's good having just

01:38:16.330 --> 01:38:17.890
bowed down they are leaderless right now

01:38:17.890 --> 01:38:19.810
they're like the Mongolians dude after

01:38:19.810 --> 01:38:23.320
the combat I know you're not you're not

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:26.290
I know disavowing the prow boys but you

01:38:26.290 --> 01:38:28.750
are and that what do you think about

01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:31.960
that like like we're programmed to be

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:33.850
like proud boys you're bad proud boys

01:38:33.850 --> 01:38:36.250
are definitely bad none of us have done

01:38:36.250 --> 01:38:40.600
the research we just know what I didn't

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:41.830
jerk off for like three days and were

01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:43.240
you [ __ ] proud boy I'm like that so

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:45.730
yeah that's one of the tenants yeah you

01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:47.560
know what you know you're totally right

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:49.900
I think that and maybe that's not fair

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:51.610
that that position I'm taking it's just

01:38:51.610 --> 01:38:53.680
that I think that what I'm this is the

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:55.210
only way I'm rationalizing in my head is

01:38:55.210 --> 01:38:58.510
that this general idea is so important I

01:38:58.510 --> 01:39:02.920
think that too if if it's going to be

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.930
immediately associated with something

01:39:04.930 --> 01:39:06.580
that other people associated with racism

01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:08.650
even if that's wrong I'm just like well

01:39:08.650 --> 01:39:11.170
no that's what this is what this thought

01:39:11.170 --> 01:39:12.820
brings if you say

01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:15.190
like Western culture is superior right

01:39:15.190 --> 01:39:17.980
that's interpreted immediately is racism

01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:19.810
I know it so no matter how you slice it

01:39:19.810 --> 01:39:21.910
no matter how you try to get that

01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:23.500
message out it's always gonna be like

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:26.830
hugging raisins right so I what I should

01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:28.300
need to stop saying it's Western culture

01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:29.890
it's just like yeah just call what it is

01:39:29.890 --> 01:39:33.550
white it's not white it's not white call

01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:35.440
it enlightenment thinking oh so you want

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:36.790
to move something like the black people

01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:42.010
that live here have you tired I can eat

01:39:42.010 --> 01:39:43.360
you want you want me started even black

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.690
people thick like this KMEL

01:39:46.690 --> 01:39:58.510

01:40:30.610 --> 01:40:32.350
America rules but it's like it needs to

01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:34.150
buck off the whole entire system full

01:40:34.150 --> 01:40:40.300
full solar full everything single person

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:42.820
Cole no you know they're bringing back

01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:44.620
though apparently they in West Virginia

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:46.360
they came up with the they found the

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.820
minerals that they make cell phones with

01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:51.760

maybe the first season yeah and I

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:19.150
totally forgot that they literally speak

01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:20.920
like it's a Shakespearean play wasn't

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:25.300
dead wood based off Rome it is Wow but

01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:27.190
they base it off he wrote a show about

01:43:27.190 --> 01:43:28.870
Rome and they rejected it he just made

01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:30.040

like [ __ ] like they throw in like

01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:48.619

01:43:51.409 --> 01:43:53.750
sucks so bad we didn't win the

01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:55.400
Revolutionary War to be not waiting to

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:57.320
start cowboys talk about [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.730
dude and they're like I'm watching the

01:43:58.730 --> 01:44:00.860
sauce to thou person I was watching it

01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:02.119
with was like maybe that's how he talks

01:44:02.119 --> 01:44:03.469
back then I was like these people were

01:44:03.469 --> 01:44:06.650
[ __ ] back then these people were

01:44:06.650 --> 01:44:09.170
they couldn't speak yeah did four people

01:44:09.170 --> 01:44:10.849
in that town could read yeah none of

01:44:10.849 --> 01:44:13.310
them were anyway yeah it's back to this

01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:18.739
Chinese he became a mathematician yeah

01:44:18.739 --> 01:44:20.570
the major study Shakespeare writing did

01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:23.119
she know her Shakespeare a little bit a

01:44:23.119 --> 01:44:25.369
little bit she hated it it was part of

01:44:25.369 --> 01:44:28.360
you to [ __ ] read that [ __ ] to be

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:35.599
that's a question that must be so hard

01:44:35.599 --> 01:44:37.099
for her to put her mad cuz you probably

01:44:37.099 --> 01:44:38.900
still got knocked it out of the park but

01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:40.550
if she has like a math brain you should

01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:42.110
dedicate her math brain of Shakespeare

01:44:42.110 --> 01:44:44.030
oh and that's what I'm saying like yeah

01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:46.250
certainly America is not perfect lot of

01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:53.540
ELLs in Shakespeare yes sucks dude oh

01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:54.770
yeah well you're just forcing people to

01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:59.480
do the [ __ ] yeah there's another one

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.599
from that stupid yeah it's happened to

01:45:02.599 --> 01:45:04.790
me in school yeah I got forced into some

01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:06.829
[ __ ] [ __ ] dude school in general

01:45:06.829 --> 01:45:08.810
yeah I should've been out doing other

01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:10.159
stuff so you like the American school

01:45:10.159 --> 01:45:14.210
system no no I think I I'm becoming more

01:45:14.210 --> 01:45:15.650
concerned about that especially is like

01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:16.909
my niece and nephew get older and

01:45:16.909 --> 01:45:18.320
they're like they're learning on their

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:20.810
own and then they're gonna go sit in a

01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:22.520
class and be forced to listen to stuff

01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:24.020
that they don't care about I just think

01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:26.630
it's like our system sucks religion

01:45:26.630 --> 01:45:34.040
sucks our government sucks you know so

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:35.719
much more than in you know whatever got

01:45:35.719 --> 01:45:37.610
us to this exact point including you

01:45:37.610 --> 01:45:39.739
know religion the school system disco I

01:45:39.739 --> 01:45:43.389
haven't meant to come off that way

01:45:43.389 --> 01:45:46.219
system rocks dude the school of public

01:45:46.219 --> 01:45:48.260
school I never went to public but I did

01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:50.210
go to [ __ ] school I was a poor for a

01:45:50.210 --> 01:45:50.910
while and then

01:45:50.910 --> 01:45:54.890
I upgrade its bucked out to war Catholic

01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:58.260
the Catholic school yeah very busy very

01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:01.650
classy a lot of Poor's run around - my

01:46:01.650 --> 01:46:03.930
mom was Catholic she converted she

01:46:03.930 --> 01:46:06.930
converted to Catholicism Judaism he

01:46:06.930 --> 01:46:09.060
converted to J yeah and your dad's a J

01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:11.820
yeah all right so you're full J I think

01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:13.380
you had to be blue your mom has to be a

01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:15.900
J right but if she converted you then

01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:25.200
your J mu J may have some Gentile blood

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:27.240
flowing around you dan hey believe me

01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:31.980
trap your mom switch to give you dude I

01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:33.870
mean Jewish Church probably rules I

01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:35.610
think it's the worst how the Catholic

01:46:35.610 --> 01:46:37.530
Mass is the easiest thing to poach

01:46:37.530 --> 01:46:43.290
people out of yeah once you don't think

01:46:43.290 --> 01:46:44.760
they do that though what I think that's

01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:46.560
nobody plays an accordion that Jewish

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:46.800
Church

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:48.720
I think Jewish Church you just sit in

01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:50.190
like a quiet room and you just hear

01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:52.200
people like breathe heavy out of their

01:46:52.200 --> 01:47:03.090
big nuts Mike for each nostril what do

01:47:03.090 --> 01:47:04.920
they do over there they definitely talk

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:07.740
they speak in [ __ ] what's it like

01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:11.100
over at the GOG dude right guy course

01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:13.170
what do you do you see and it's just

01:47:13.170 --> 01:47:14.970
like any other service he's denied the

01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:17.040
Jewish faith three times last week yeah

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.410
I'm not I don't like I said I'm probably

01:47:19.410 --> 01:47:21.120
culturally Jewish in the you know the

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:24.560
complain enos he went to the gog yeah

01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:27.060
you just kind of go there it's the same

01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:28.920
thing as any other thing that you you

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.530
know read a passage from in this case

01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:37.020
the Old Testament yeah and then you know

01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:38.880
there's a I forget what it's called but

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:40.500
there's sort of like a breakdown this is

01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:41.820
what it means and then there's an

01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:44.040
application to something that's going on

01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:55.260
in current events in the GOG I know I

01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:57.570
still believed in God about it so I did

01:47:57.570 --> 01:47:57.870
go

01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:59.130
you believe in God when 9/11 happened

01:47:59.130 --> 01:48:02.520
yeah what yeah I wasn't believing God

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:04.320
till I think like my mid-20s he believed

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.070
in Jake

01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:06.989
till your 20s well all that it's all the

01:48:06.989 --> 01:48:10.770
sea then you sell him smite what until

01:48:10.770 --> 01:48:12.780
you saw him smite those towers no no it

01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:13.889
was that then I started taking more

01:48:13.889 --> 01:48:16.650
interested in religion and then because

01:48:16.650 --> 01:48:18.150
you're just like what the [ __ ] do they

01:48:18.150 --> 01:48:23.340
believe when did you say same God what

01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:24.869
was the moment that you're like a bull

01:48:24.869 --> 01:48:26.909
[ __ ] it was a line and it was the same

01:48:26.909 --> 01:48:28.230
Harris book because he said because it

01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:33.179
Sam Harris got you yeah I was gonna say

01:48:33.179 --> 01:48:36.270
he's gotta be but he he was raised yes

01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:38.520
okay I think I didn't know he was until

01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.860
I thought he was once you proposed that

01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.809
question I was like definitely yeah even

01:48:42.809 --> 01:48:47.219
though his name's Harris I have to

01:48:47.219 --> 01:48:48.869
assume that's like a book name I don't

01:48:48.869 --> 01:48:54.119
look the way I said that but true you

01:48:54.119 --> 01:48:57.659
think Sam's hiding is Jay yeah writing

01:48:57.659 --> 01:48:59.340
that sort of incendiary know we should

01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:02.760
do come on you know we should do so that

01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.110
they can't hide it just like get like a

01:49:04.110 --> 01:49:06.809
patch they have to wear on their clothes

01:49:06.809 --> 01:49:13.260
or something so Wayne what you see you

01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:14.820
just use some whould were you when you

01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:16.889
stumbled across this oh man I forgot

01:49:16.889 --> 01:49:23.460
what his face looked like that was like

01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:25.619
14 remember my teacher was like wrote

01:49:25.619 --> 01:49:27.599
like God the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus

01:49:27.599 --> 01:49:29.940
God the Easter Bunny born Sam Harris

01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:32.790
oh that makes sense oh really yeah and

01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:35.010
make it one key in our class cried he

01:49:35.010 --> 01:49:36.540
was like he was like he went to like all

01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:39.840
like the church retreat stuff and he was

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.559
like how do you know that love is real

01:49:43.559 --> 01:49:45.090
my teacher was just like because my wife

01:49:45.090 --> 01:49:46.889
[ __ ] cooks me dinner every night she

01:49:46.889 --> 01:49:51.059
you know he [ __ ] crush this kid try

01:49:51.059 --> 01:49:52.380
to have a debate with him and this dude

01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:54.449
was like 35 the teacher was like doing

01:49:54.449 --> 01:49:57.809
like mad coke he was just all spun out

01:49:57.809 --> 01:49:59.610
and he was just like here's why you

01:49:59.610 --> 01:50:01.409
can't handle reality it's a [ __ ]

01:50:01.409 --> 01:50:03.420
crutch dude laid it on a room full of

01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:06.690
[ __ ] like 15 14 year old

01:50:06.690 --> 01:50:09.060
Wow he right then I was like oh that

01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:10.199
makes sense and I was like yeah [ __ ]

01:50:10.199 --> 01:50:12.719
yeah whatever for me it was it was one

01:50:12.719 --> 01:50:14.190
of those things it was like they don't

01:50:14.190 --> 01:50:15.690
carry that into like your early twenties

01:50:15.690 --> 01:50:18.300
yeah yeah a convenience thing you know

01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:19.680
and so he's what he was talking about

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.150
because it felt good if you still caught

01:50:24.150 --> 01:50:27.300
me like yeah like four years ago I if I

01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:28.980
was like on some terbium plane or like

01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:30.870
something like really [ __ ] up at me I

01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:33.750
would be like alright alright there's no

01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:36.900
[ __ ] thing dude and that's what I'm

01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:38.430
saying there I swear to God I think it's

01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:39.960
some sort of inbuilt mechanism to be

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:44.340
like oh well I think so I do believe

01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:48.420
that there are no foxhole yeah door

01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:57.750
there aren't Nazi foxholes I think

01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:59.699
they're called were they in a foxhole

01:50:59.699 --> 01:51:01.469
and they met because that doesn't debunk

01:51:01.469 --> 01:51:06.000
that you mean atheists out of a foxhole

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:06.960
yeah that's the whole point

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:09.840
okay yeah was that one line where he's

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.699
just like cuz it feels good but he's

01:51:11.699 --> 01:51:13.410
like it also feel good to believe that

01:51:13.410 --> 01:51:15.480
you had a massive diamond the size of a

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:17.100
fridge bared in your backyard but if you

01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:18.719
went around believing that people just

01:51:18.719 --> 01:51:20.400
be like you're crazy you know it feel

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:22.230
really good to believe it yeah and see

01:51:22.230 --> 01:51:23.850
that's the thing like this you you guys

01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:28.410
in my you guys I mean like you just [ __ ]

01:51:28.410 --> 01:51:30.780
on religion as if it's this dumb [ __ ]

01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:33.120
like hi I better be good or God's gonna

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:35.699
hurt me that's not what religion is to

01:51:35.699 --> 01:51:39.090
people that can think well no don't love

01:51:39.090 --> 01:51:41.130
me in on that because I would never like

01:51:41.130 --> 01:51:43.710
attack like you call got like the Flying

01:51:43.710 --> 01:51:45.540
Spaghetti Monster in the sky or like

01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:47.100
there's a diamond in my backyard it's

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:49.130
like that's not what people think God is

01:51:49.130 --> 01:51:53.340
was really no I'm saying you okay like

01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:55.290
that like it's not like you think of

01:51:55.290 --> 01:51:59.250
religion is this thing that like you you

01:51:59.250 --> 01:52:01.110
look at it through the idiots lens of

01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:03.660
Christianity and any religion because

01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:05.100
there are ton of morons that are like

01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:08.540
I'd better be good or God's gonna hurt I

01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:11.370
was quoting from a book all right well

01:52:11.370 --> 01:52:13.290
that quote is what I was attacking

01:52:13.290 --> 01:52:15.239
that's what Harris Pierson they were

01:52:15.239 --> 01:52:18.320
working on me I mean you know however

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.219
Dawkins has a very

01:52:20.219 --> 01:52:22.289
caustic like he's arrogant and

01:52:22.289 --> 01:52:23.699
condescending to people I don't agree

01:52:23.699 --> 01:52:25.829
with that tactic and I don't think that

01:52:25.829 --> 01:52:27.599
people who believe in religion are

01:52:27.599 --> 01:52:30.420
stupid most are way smarter than me

01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:32.340
there's you know there's different areas

01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:35.519
of you know Intel it's just just because

01:52:35.519 --> 01:52:37.170
you believe this thing doesn't mean

01:52:37.170 --> 01:52:40.050
anybody stupid and so yeah I don't know

01:52:40.050 --> 01:52:42.389
I don't I don't mean necessarily they're

01:52:42.389 --> 01:52:44.570
stupid I mean what the actual like

01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:46.889
teachings are and things like that like

01:52:46.889 --> 01:52:50.309
it's it's not this like well you're

01:52:50.309 --> 01:52:51.539
gonna get here and it's paradise

01:52:51.539 --> 01:52:53.489
necessarily like a lot of things with

01:52:53.489 --> 01:52:55.229
Catholicism you like get into it it's

01:52:55.229 --> 01:52:57.840
like life's suffering try to be good

01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:01.710
like along those lines and like I've

01:53:01.710 --> 01:53:03.929
known of it contradicts science I no

01:53:03.929 --> 01:53:06.329
question that there are great teaching

01:53:06.329 --> 01:53:08.070
under the contradicts going to Mars I

01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:09.389
have no questions there's great

01:53:09.389 --> 01:53:10.949
teachings in it and when I talk about

01:53:10.949 --> 01:53:12.960
utopia I'm just trying to use an example

01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:17.639
that's like without a gray area more

01:53:17.639 --> 01:53:21.269
black and white so just just to show

01:53:21.269 --> 01:53:24.360
what that necessarily you're talking

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.920
what bucked you out of it the stuff you

01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:28.829
read well just more now yeah I mean like

01:53:28.829 --> 01:53:32.699
people can operate religious people like

01:53:32.699 --> 01:53:34.170
like it what happens in this country

01:53:34.170 --> 01:53:38.460
operate with Western values so would you

01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:40.590
you have this where those Western values

01:53:40.590 --> 01:53:42.510
stem from where'd they come from

01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:47.309
creepy enlightenment I think so we've

01:53:47.309 --> 01:53:52.829
had this conversation okay yeah I mean

01:53:52.829 --> 01:53:55.229
Catholicism fueled Western thought is

01:53:55.229 --> 01:53:59.820
pretty much Christian values grew out of

01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:04.530
it but what would you say it was more

01:54:04.530 --> 01:54:05.699
like because there was like the Greeks

01:54:05.699 --> 01:54:08.010
and they were like very not really very

01:54:08.010 --> 01:54:10.409
religious freaks in Romans were like a

01:54:10.409 --> 01:54:13.229
very sick like secular society I like

01:54:13.229 --> 01:54:14.489
their gods and stuff but they weren't

01:54:14.489 --> 01:54:16.909
like yeah the Celts were very into like

01:54:16.909 --> 01:54:19.650
supernatural crazy [ __ ] the Greeks and

01:54:19.650 --> 01:54:21.360
Romans were like these guys are weird as

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:23.690
[ __ ] it's super [ __ ] weird

01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:26.579
whatever yeah who cares don't go to

01:54:26.579 --> 01:54:31.979

Church is so [ __ ] boring it's so dumb

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.130
everything I hear and every time I go

01:54:41.130 --> 01:54:42.810
once a year basically with my mom and

01:54:42.810 --> 01:54:46.400

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.900
right I'll give you guys another shot

01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:57.810
it's like priests are [ __ ] dumb

01:54:57.810 --> 01:54:59.820
yeah they teach this [ __ ] at an

01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:01.770
extremely basic level like that [ __ ]

01:55:01.770 --> 01:55:04.080
some some guy from Providence some

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.840
bishop was like remember the LGBT

01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:08.970

dumb [ __ ]

01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:20.430
Oh like this is this isn't what we're

01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:21.780
this in the fight we're trying to fight

01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:23.610
right now yeah they're just trying to

01:55:23.610 --> 01:55:24.900
keep the call first there's a lot of

01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:26.850
[ __ ] morons involved for sure

01:55:26.850 --> 01:55:29.280
yeah yeah but I really want to make that

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:30.780
clear that it's I don't think people are

01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:32.520

01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:30.200
Nicolas Cage comes down and freezes

thanks man dude it's easy when you look

01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:58.949
across a couple silver tongue [ __ ]

01:56:58.949 --> 01:57:01.260
callous dudes is what I sit there and

01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:04.190
try and talk and be entertaining yeah

01:57:04.190 --> 01:57:08.330
when you bring in white nationalist

01:57:08.929 --> 01:57:11.010
losers gangsters can trouble for having

01:57:11.010 --> 01:57:13.110
Milo also a Jewish white nationalist

01:57:13.110 --> 01:57:18.929
just like you I like Western chauvinist

01:57:18.929 --> 01:57:20.969
whatever you want to call it to call it

01:57:20.969 --> 01:57:23.820
that let's just say hey principles of

01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:26.880
checks and balances are really important

01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:28.409
how about guy who doesn't respect other

01:57:28.409 --> 01:57:30.540
cultures I'm fine with that

01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:32.690
[Laughter]

01:57:32.690 --> 01:57:34.920
you'd be fine with a cultural

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:39.020
imperialist during Ramadan dude yeah

01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:42.480
yeah well yeah I think that these ideas

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:44.820
are the only ways that we solve problems

01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:46.440
moving forward and that's gonna take the

01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:47.880
most amount of people out of suffering

01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:50.520
so of course I love love it I want it to

01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:52.050
spread to the way we're gonna be living

01:57:52.050 --> 01:57:53.639
through me traveling through space we

01:57:53.639 --> 01:57:55.350
got to ditch all these stupid archaic

01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:57.150
ideas and come up with some new things

01:57:57.150 --> 01:57:59.880
we can believe in I don't I'm not gonna

01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.889
agree where do you find a modern man

01:58:01.889 --> 01:58:05.159
divide the Rives meaning from a bit of a

01:58:05.159 --> 01:58:08.250
meaning desert meaning yeah that's tough

01:58:08.250 --> 01:58:11.489
I don't know so we got to start thinking

01:58:11.489 --> 01:58:20.250
about a new myth damn we need to shed

01:58:20.250 --> 01:58:21.540
all these Muslims if we're gonna go to

01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:31.500
Mars spaceship that's gonna take us to

01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:32.730
Mars take all the good white people to

01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:36.090
Mars but if Muslims go to March the day

01:58:36.090 --> 01:58:41.300
we're like crazy Jafar [ __ ] the Red Sea

01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:43.920
collars up over their head I wish Holmes

01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:45.449
could catch up on the space program so

01:58:45.449 --> 01:58:49.310
we can see some wild [ __ ] astronaut

01:58:50.929 --> 01:58:53.340
modern military uniforms what do they do

01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:55.409
they just [ __ ] toss on like a turban

01:58:55.409 --> 01:58:57.210
on the type of like sick cam I wonder

01:58:57.210 --> 01:58:58.710
where all your old altar boys [ __ ] went

01:58:58.710 --> 01:59:01.880
they buy it in bulk

01:59:05.590 --> 01:59:08.389
we want Muslims there too which is same

01:59:08.389 --> 01:59:09.800
thing they just need to start blocking

01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:14.030
like if there's Muslims that believe in

01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:17.420
God but still allow for the system of

01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:18.889
checks and balances and don't impose

01:59:18.889 --> 01:59:21.559
that on other people great for sure come

01:59:21.559 --> 01:59:23.780
on over let's do it come to Mars Wow

01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:25.760
wear your fly ass [ __ ] space gear I

01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:31.880
love that so much do you think they

01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:33.530
probably would not have landing gear but

01:59:33.530 --> 01:59:35.960
it puts landing gear on UM's muslim

01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:39.980
spaceship I just smashed right into the

01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:41.599
we're doing something wrong with the

01:59:41.599 --> 01:59:42.949
calculations you can't figure it out

01:59:42.949 --> 01:59:46.519
like landing what is this what this is

01:59:46.519 --> 01:59:51.260
landing yeah what you need to do on your

01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:53.119
yawn mosque spaceship that's gonna save

01:59:53.119 --> 01:59:54.349
all the good people and take them to the

01:59:54.349 --> 01:59:56.420
good place not not religious at all but

01:59:56.420 --> 02:00:03.139
uh that's gonna save us it's our

02:00:03.139 --> 02:00:16.340
salvation get an escape pod and right

02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:18.019
instead of on the escape pod you just

02:00:18.019 --> 02:00:18.980
write like in crayon

02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:21.530
just be like mosque and then when all

02:00:21.530 --> 02:00:24.170
the Muslims go and they eject launch

02:00:24.170 --> 02:00:38.570
them off I converted to quote that makes

02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:41.900
you Muslim Adam I can't make the show

02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:44.539
