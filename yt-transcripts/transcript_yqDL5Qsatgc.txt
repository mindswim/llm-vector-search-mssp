00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.060
on right now we're all about man we're

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.970
[ __ ] on damn I was just reading that

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.469
MSG article CNN put out

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.360
did you see the things people shared of

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.099
like they had Eddie Huang I believe do

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.990
it and yeah somebody else were like

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.930
change the dictionary merriam-webster

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.289
yeah I think yeah I I don't I don't mind

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.600
that I do I think it's funny to like

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.180
make it a cause but like Chinese

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.529
restaurant syndrome does sound a little

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.820
it is aggressive but at the same time

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.980
it's not people didn't like look at

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.780
Chinese people form this opinion they

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.610
ate Chinese should we be talking about

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.640
that so even be on the air right now I

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.379
mean it it is a funny thing to be like

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.329
Chinese food it's not really China it

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.670
would be like if people just ate Burger

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.960
King we're like dude American foods

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.640
[ __ ] up because pretty much most

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.110
people eat Chinese food and eat like

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.870
yeah you know places like like all at

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.550
the [ __ ] on the way you can get actual

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.379
Chinese but again

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.780
where let me know where those spots are

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.489
because every time a Chinese food I feel

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.939
[ __ ] those starving two hours I'm

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.470
here to push them they're like this is

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.490
racist and it's like well okay it is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.110
funny they give it all to the Chinese

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.049
though like when you eat sushi you don't

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.460
feel [ __ ] hungry two minutes later

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.080
they were like it's in American food so

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.509
it's in Doritos and ranch it's like yeah

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.030
dude [ __ ] if anybody these Doritos isn't

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.189
like this is a good cuisine like now

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.689
dude I'm embarrassed I'm eating this

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.640
true you're not eating [ __ ] like a

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.229
criticism it's like when I go eat some

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.009
[ __ ] Doritos yeah especially like you

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.900

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.810

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.380
the Cheetos an endangered species yeah I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.729

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.460

no horns obviously it gives you hard as

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.019
[ __ ] definitely worth it if we got it

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.489

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.209

territory and he was going to battle

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.940
with the actual racists and then me

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.370
being the coastal elites abolitionists

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.440
down south all his troops were down

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.300
south fighting just women and children I

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.709

time is which Business Insider is such a

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.540
weird publication and be like eyelets

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.640
baby I am pretty lawful for the clicks

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.320
there is no morality in journalism

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.030
especially not business insider dude

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.080
they're gonna be talking about something

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.410
else

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.510
because I I pulled it up yesterday I was

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.000
going I was researching famous

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.320
historical figures who've cheated on

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.000
their wife I'm expanding dude I'm

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.870
altering my act oh I hear you exactly so

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.580
I'm looking all these people who [ __ ]

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.710
cheated I'm like that's hilarious MLK

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.970
comes off I'm like yeah I heard he was a

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.600
bit of a womanizer dude they're saying

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.030
like he on tape FBI people were

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.740
listening and of Reverend he was a

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.050
pastor he was with raped a woman in a

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.480
hotel room they were all in and but then

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.310
they're like the FBI was just sitting

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.680
there like oh [ __ ] and this again this

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.100
is according to the FBI who heard there

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.620
was a black guy being like hey come on

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.420
the [ __ ] sucks for us and they're like

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.850
go dig up some dirt on him I mean I'm so

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.530
it's like do you think they planted it

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.030
do you think they made this [ __ ] up dude

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.770
what the it's like it's the most

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.090
uncomfortable thing to think about

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.100
because from like anyway you look at

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.390
it's like there's a chance this guy he

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.280
was a freedom fighter was also a [ __ ]

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.230
hound whatever

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.460
yeah but dude they're like going into

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.660
like orgies were like they're saying

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.160
like he would lay on the pillow and like

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.290
get real close up on pen shots and like

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:52.700
watch his boy [ __ ] it's so weird but

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.559
then again it's coming from Hoover's FBI

00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:58.070
dude yeah I see FBI body it was like we

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.620
gotta squash this black man so let's dig

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.030
up dirt and they're like this guy's like

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.799
well we got but they it also was all

00:18:03.799 --> 00:18:07.090
sealed he loves to get his head

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.770
according this article again I could

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.240
have just like made it too into

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.559
something I want these dudes in like a

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:15.679
van being like sir we got him you know

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.480
that shot and porn the underneath shot

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:23.150
if he puts his head but then again it's

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.040
like all the things are sealed so no one

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.510
can so there's this thing that's like oh

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.549
yeah him yeah he like watch drapes and

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:30.380
stuff but you guys can never hear it is

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.049
it sealed so they're able to just be oh

00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:35.540
yeah no yeah he's [ __ ] plus he had

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:40.270

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.820
MLK had a couple cocktails his boys were

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.200

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.960
stuck his head down there do you ever do

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.360
something weird just randomly and then

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.309

that's what he's into

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.030
I also loved he's just doing something

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.100
weird I sell the fact it's like act as

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.410
if if anyone bugged anyone's house for a

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.390
significant amount of time someone there

00:25:13.359 --> 00:25:15.220
strong turn down I did turn that down

abuse it no losses jostle that's

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.809
wiretapping let's record the president

00:25:37.809 --> 00:25:45.429
nominees secretly dude they did it a

00:25:45.429 --> 00:25:48.100
court allegedly true Obama higher up

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.659
Trump he listened to Trump we should

00:25:49.659 --> 00:25:51.129
think the reason you know that that's

00:25:51.129 --> 00:25:53.049
not true that Obama didn't why that

00:25:53.049 --> 00:25:54.429
because right away they would have got

00:25:54.429 --> 00:25:57.580
dirt it was a weird thing he was like

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.929
how did they not get dirt on him yet

00:25:58.929 --> 00:26:01.210
dude it's the power dog the powers that

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.359
be that are digging on that guy did I I

00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:07.809
mean take me six minutes ago this guy

00:26:07.809 --> 00:26:09.489
who was a parking authority $5,000 I

00:26:09.489 --> 00:26:12.309
mean shut up honestly it takes to get

00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:14.109
dirt on someone for me it took four

00:26:14.109 --> 00:26:16.749
hours literally to actually have the

00:26:16.749 --> 00:26:18.970
article complete took like four hours

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.190
how did I mean I just wonder how they

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.840
haven't got him yet they got the problem

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.570
we had the [ __ ] tape bro you're talking

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.179
lawyers you're talking tax guys but

00:26:28.179 --> 00:26:29.980
again he has lawyers and tax so he's I

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.950
guess kind of like said

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:34.070
for that against that yeah he cheated

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.980
too good he cheated on his bet yeah I

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.630
mean he openly was opposed to yond

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.120
forever so they can't really get him on

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.240
that yeah I think that's his defense is

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.799
just like he's pretty much been openly

00:26:45.799 --> 00:26:47.299
shitty mm-hmm

00:26:47.299 --> 00:26:51.320
but he doesn't drink according adderall

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.740
true true he's doing something man

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.570
yeah did you see that picture of him

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.490
normally did that Taco Tuesday thing

00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:59.870
when everyone was like he hates

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:02.419
Hispanics he he tweeted like a picture

00:27:02.419 --> 00:27:03.980
of him eating at Taco Tuesday it was

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.480
like a burrito bowl yeah he was eating

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.039
like a burrito bowl in his office at

00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:09.399
Trump Tower it was like we love Mexicans

00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:13.039
but there was an open drawer in the

00:27:13.039 --> 00:27:14.570
background that was just filled with

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:18.110
sudafed like 30 [ __ ] packs of sudafed

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.510
the top exactly why you're taking I

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:42.679
worked in a real estate company

that keep you going but other than that

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.920
it's just yeah why I inherit have like

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.600
way too much yang energy so like when I

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.130
take adderall I just go way over the top

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:17.000
really handle even a little bit of yang

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.200
that's what I'm saying like I have so

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.520
much of it so I have that's why I'm

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.070
constantly just a lot you're just you're

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:25.220
very passive very subdued no lose

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.720
something confrontational like yang

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.309
energy comes you freak out it's

00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:30.380

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.299
I'm saying if too much yang energy dude

00:29:38.299 --> 00:29:41.960
is a problem it's soccer a yang sport or

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.049

00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:48.100
all sports yang know what's worse golf

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.270
that's a lot of yin energy that's a lot

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.880
of you know just harness you're so yeah

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.590

ball [ __ ] yeah yeah no yeah Mme there's

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.070
there's point yeah there's again this

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.260
all boils down to individuals I mean

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.340
what do you think football is why do you

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.960

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.820
pretty much yang energy and figure

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.110

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.660
dude was stepped on and trampled and

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.160
oppressed and then pulled into like a

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.740
yang drug-taking system which would be

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.150
the whole like we're gonna get [ __ ] up

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.119

00:35:46.119 --> 00:35:47.650
that kind of activity to that's why you

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:49.029

00:35:49.029 --> 00:35:50.319

00:36:03.519 --> 00:36:06.250
psilocybin who's there's head medicine

Spears of all the planet there's like a

00:36:07.329 --> 00:36:09.220
thousand spirits in every plant but you

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.859
have to find the head medicine spirit

00:36:10.859 --> 00:36:13.180
dude I literally figure this out during

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.789
the deep dive well yeah what was the

00:36:15.789 --> 00:36:18.490
deep dug so sorry it's an hour so you

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:20.170
you have I'd see the kid but early come

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:21.910
over hit them with the edibles first

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:23.680
chill out get high as [ __ ] on gummy

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.660
bears not yet so you let be while that's

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:28.329
kicking in you sit talk I had a big old

00:36:28.329 --> 00:36:30.970
real comfortable beanbag see the kids on

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:32.650
my little chaise bags lava lamps it's

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:34.750
pretty tight too so he goes down so your

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:37.180
while the edible is you know starting to

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.099
kick in all that while the the bong

00:36:39.099 --> 00:36:42.130
that's the name of the that's where the

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.230
term comes from seeing Jess table I was

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.700
like the the milk tea they used to make

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.730
in India was called bong but the much

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:49.960
ago that's where they say so much you

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.269
and your culture have perverted it in a

00:36:52.269 --> 00:36:55.960
long bro no just like the Nazis took the

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.150
swastika out of there and hurt it it's

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:00.910
you and your STONER ilk nope that was

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:02.349
just Santa Maria getting by as she

00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:04.660
needed to for the time dude she they we

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.130
forced her underground dude she had to

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:08.470
live through those channels so the so

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:09.369
you you take it

00:37:09.369 --> 00:37:11.410
edibles in and then you sit down oh my

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:12.819
god here's the deal I explained Santa

00:37:12.819 --> 00:37:19.779
Maria too so that first of all they had

00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:21.279
to go me the Gobi hasn't kicked in yet

00:37:21.279 --> 00:37:23.920
fire up the volcano so what the way

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.849
you're doing I learned this through

00:37:24.849 --> 00:37:26.799
cannabis and spirituality you've got to

00:37:26.799 --> 00:37:28.569
get all the plants so you got to get an

00:37:28.569 --> 00:37:31.059
indica sativa and a hybrid so I have six

00:37:31.059 --> 00:37:32.559
different strings here like getting body

00:37:32.559 --> 00:37:34.900
eyes head high good not that hungry full

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.110
spectrum whoo

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.400
we'll come in but that's you can put a

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.630
little bit of Himalayan salt in the

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:39.920
water and that gives your body

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.520
electrolyte so that it doesn't crave

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.290
acidic foods when you when you're in it

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.090
we're in the grasp of Santa Maria that's

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:49.010
it you're in an alkaline your body goes

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.570
into an alkaline Lance crave

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.840
electrolytes no Santa Maria plants crave

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.270
they do but they put you in and out that

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:57.560
they plan to put you in an alkaline

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.300
state and then your body normally

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.880
running on acidic like inflammatory

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.740
you're very Eastern you're very Eastern

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.930
like medicine tech you know I'm a

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:07.460
combination of both I like both you know

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.990
I'm again I'm Apollonian so I'm a

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.970
synthesizer so I'm right on the line of

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:13.820
the Yi and the yang anyway but the so

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:15.920
then I think you're that Don in the yang

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.710
that little dot again dot the yang thank

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.330
you yeah that's what I feel that I like

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.040
that you're surrounded by yang but you

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:26.930
exude Yin I tried to dude I put yang 70

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:35.600
Bend fork sorry Wow so I make the I told

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.040
him you'll see this is this is the blend

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.420
dude you got this is a little bit of

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.890
everything put that into volcano we're

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:41.330
hitting the volcano you hit the volcano

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:42.650
bags pretty serious it's a very

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:45.320
spiritual important volcano dude is you

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.640
got to work with the tools you have dude

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.380
yeah and then the volcano's nice because

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.210
then you get the fall like when you

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:51.650
vaporized it it's a little bit different

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.420
when you add the edible in there so dude

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.650
I get them enough state with the volcano

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.300
or like things are looking a little

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:57.950
cartoonish time like alright guys sounds

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.510
a little weird I explained Santamaria

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:01.610
I'm like you gotta you have to this is

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:03.200
the thing as a primary you probably go

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.390
wrong when you try to utilize cannabis

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.100
you got to set an intention I get high

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:12.140
like a jackass if the send intention up

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:18.710
there you have to set an intention so

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:19.940
you have to go alright this is what I

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.050
told him like you don't have one just

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:22.940
set an intention of interfacing with

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.620
santamaría the head I just take a bunch

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.240
of mushrooms and come hang out you can

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.710
do that too yeah you can do that too I

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:29.210
mean it definitely be battling energies

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:34.400
but we could probably can take some bud

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.780
light's no a shotgun a BL dude you can't

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.950
have my light that's

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.610
[Music]

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:46.280
Kangas help you can do that they they

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.870
warn against out alcohol can be a crutch

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:49.460
for people in this state because it just

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.290
it just washes out yeah because you need

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:53.869
there if you it kind of which I'm gonna

00:39:53.869 --> 00:39:54.950
call it well if you're smoking

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.450
cigarettes tobacco kind of calcifies

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:58.580
your pineal gland yeah so it's like if

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.109
you have cigarettes you're like your

00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:02.560
that's when people mix tobacco and

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.940
cannabis I don't say marijuana or weed

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.280
anymore when they mix it it's say like

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.680
this book is so far the the claims they

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.640
make or just kind of go obviously

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:14.180
tobacco like calorie by brain pardons

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.470
the walls around the pineal gland so

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:17.570
like when you smoke a spliff basically

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:19.400
they're saying that it like hardens the

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.420
walls around the pineal gland but

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.770
activates the pineal gland so you get

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:23.930
trapped in that you're like oh you're

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:26.960
Union you just freaks you out but you

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.609
know so your alcohol disturb' off track

00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:30.800
but so that's the whole so you get

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.030
people into a state where like I

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.410
explained home I set an intention think

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:34.310
about something you want to think about

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:36.740
work on if not just mess around you'll

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.910
have to believe in it but just messing

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:40.010
about Santa Maria with interfacing with

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.800
a marry medicine spirit could be married

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.670
could be Santa Maria bro Saint Mary

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:49.369
that's Mary Jesus's mother yeah could be

00:40:49.369 --> 00:40:51.800
could be dude again I mean we're not

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.210
gonna talk about you know you got a

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.190
channel the Virgin Mary you can but

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.560
again I talked about like the what is it

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.420
the monotheistic Colts out of the desert

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.010
obviously they're harsh because their

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.630
natural habitat was like not it was

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.010
pretty unforgiving there for their God

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:05.119
they project it was like the

00:41:05.119 --> 00:41:06.770
manifestation of a natural habitat but

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.839
anyway the arrow yeah you know that's

00:41:08.839 --> 00:41:10.820
why the Old Testament God so nasty and

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.260
and [ __ ] because there were

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.300
desert people yeah they're just pissed

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.369
yeah that literally it came from the

00:41:16.369 --> 00:41:18.800
deserts mono Western monotheism came

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:24.470
from the deserts so anyway excuse me so

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:26.030
yeah you said an attention you interface

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:27.080
with Santa Maria and dude when I'm

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.400
explaining of Santa Maria they're just

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.630
both I see their eyes there's like

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:31.490

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.050
they're just like they're so [ __ ]

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:36.410

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.270
seconds it's vapor it's like a tea

reason Atlanta blew up like that is

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:13.099

the radio but LA or Atlanta was like

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.099
focused entirely on making good dance

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.690
what the [ __ ] it was something about

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:44.630
like I think I'd like a heart app on my

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:45.980
watch and it beeped and I was like

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:47.180
constantly I'm thinking like my heart so

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.310
I'm have a heart attack now I'm you know

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:50.869
I don't obviously but I had that was a

00:46:50.869 --> 00:46:52.760
thing I had for a while and my hard

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.950
thing beeps and I was just like this is

00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:56.359
it I knew it my heart's going I'm

00:46:56.359 --> 00:46:57.890
getting sensors at my hearts or like

00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:59.390
sensor alerts my heart's getting [ __ ]

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:02.089
up and so I feel a tinge of anxiety and

00:47:02.089 --> 00:47:03.680
I'm like Kat damn it someone here I am

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.869
again baby flood it with the negative

00:47:05.869 --> 00:47:07.550
neuro chemicals yeah you know I got like

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:09.920
a like whatever adrenaline and all those

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:10.940
other things that giving you make you

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.310
give you that anxiety feeling something

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.599
all right how do I get out of this I'm

00:47:14.599 --> 00:47:16.490
in like a meditative trance do something

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:17.690
you're just like thinking like and

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:19.040
you're just visualizing your thoughts

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.900
it's [ __ ] sick and then I was like

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:22.579
alright I have to start thinking good

00:47:22.579 --> 00:47:24.020
thoughts cuz I'm my bad thoughts or

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:26.630
triggering or triggering like a cascade

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:28.910
of negative neurotransmitters so I have

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:30.800
to think the good thoughts so I'm like

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.240
alright I'm thinking the good thoughts

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.220
I'm like I'm cool there's a net my

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.380
[ __ ] life sick all right and then it

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.480
was like it's not working and I was like

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.579
oh yeah in order to get the actual

00:47:40.579 --> 00:47:43.069
neurochemical payoff you have to believe

00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:45.349
the good thoughts in order to believe

00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:47.150
the good thoughts you have to living on

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:50.119
is true life dude so I'm like damn I do

00:47:50.119 --> 00:47:52.670
those things that's what's off goes away

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.250
and I'm like [ __ ] it has figured it out

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:56.750
at least how to get like I'm negative

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:59.569
mind state typically you have to check

00:47:59.569 --> 00:48:00.740
in you have to go alright what's good

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:01.910
you're like this is pretty cool it's

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:02.690
pretty cool and you can't think of

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:04.040
anything good it's like well well if

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.500
your life's a [ __ ] mess dude that's

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.150
when you start that's the point of Santa

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:09.980
Maria then you go okay well what could I

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:10.339
do

00:48:10.339 --> 00:48:12.109
Santa Maria what could I be doing better

00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:13.970
dude I did it was Santa Maria say does

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:15.890
she sell TV examples to just speak

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:17.869
through you she speaks three she's in

00:48:17.869 --> 00:48:19.640
your body basically but because you

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.040
ingest her but the so the other I I was

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.359
having problems with my BAE dude we're

00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:25.069
fighting like [ __ ] constantly

00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:26.300
it wasn't that bad it's getting better

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.339
but it's like we're just tit-for-tat and

00:48:28.339 --> 00:48:31.730
I'm I'm in my head like it's her I know

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:33.740
it's her she's like I've really thought

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:36.589
like I'm not doing anything it's her

00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:38.329
so before like you know a week before

00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:40.880
the last one I did I'm like let's

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.410
there's a first time I try to mess

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:44.780
around with Santa Maria dude I lay I sit

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:45.150
there

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:46.920
like Santa Maria tell me what's wrong

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.789
with my [ __ ] stupid wife literally

00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:53.039
just within like two seconds it was like

00:48:53.039 --> 00:48:54.119
well you haven't done this you guys

00:48:54.119 --> 00:48:55.349
don't go anywhere you guys don't do

00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:56.910
anything you don't really touch her that

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:57.720
much Oh

00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.700
like all this thing obviously like do

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:00.960
but they're like dude like I was gonna

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.910
get her a massage basically yeah and

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:04.740
then it was basically like why would you

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.170
pay somebody else to rub your wife Santa

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:09.329
Maria was basically like you're gay you

00:49:09.329 --> 00:49:13.829
got high or like it was like go do this

00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:15.839
go do that and then it was like they

00:49:15.839 --> 00:49:16.799
might it ain't this is all kind of

00:49:16.799 --> 00:49:18.420
occurred in your head and it's like you

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.890
guys don't do anything and I was like

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.690
all right well I'll just tell her we're

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:22.859

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:24.240
go see a movie I don't take you anywhere

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.010

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:28.920
[ __ ] yeah pretty crazy dude so you think

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.839
like it does it kind of just like my

00:49:30.839 --> 00:49:32.160
friend was explaining this to me last

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.039
night it just kind of like pushes pulls

00:49:35.039 --> 00:49:36.359
here you go apart for long enough that

00:49:36.359 --> 00:49:38.369
you can be like okay here's all the way

00:49:38.369 --> 00:49:39.569
yourself I'm doing wrong that I'm just

00:49:39.569 --> 00:49:41.460
inherently I just won't see because I'm

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.740
I just can't take it like that if you

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.880
were seeing all the stuff you're doing

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.829
wrong 24/7 with hoes you can't function

00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:52.140
watching from the sidelines on most of

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:52.410
it

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:53.940
so then dude in the book - it talks

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:55.890
about this how you get to like when you

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:57.690
get deep enough into that state you

00:49:57.690 --> 00:49:59.789
interact with like your very deepest

00:49:59.789 --> 00:50:01.950
base level fears and then you get

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:04.190
yourself through like thinking about it

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:06.990
you can literally remove them and then

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:08.520
experience what it's like to not have

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.710
those baseline fears in your head and

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:12.180
then like when it like goes up they come

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.549
back and here's like oh Jesus Christ I'm

00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:16.020
carrying all this and you know you can

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.400

we all except the first [ __ ] night

00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:16.140

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:32.500
of like the Pacific Northwest where it's

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.690
like is it on that side I get [ __ ]

00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:35.320

universally it's pretty heavy snow for

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.040

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.030
worse

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:54.100
obviously in some parts but like I was

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.550
