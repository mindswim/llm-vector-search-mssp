dude it's hard because you're still

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.280
talking [ __ ] like for me the situation

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.280
that i was in like this is not a sign of

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.160
victory i'm still right about that oh

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.479

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.400
attacks when arguing with a girlfriend

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.000
or like with my ex-wife like it's the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
only time i've never had a panic attack

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.199
for any other reason it's always

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.280
mid-argument and that [ __ ] sucks

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.120
because you automatically lost and now

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.639

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.479

and then even once they show you the

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.880
evidence you got to just make up a more

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.639
ridiculous like what i don't know well i

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:39.840

sometimes you know what i mean yeah yeah

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.919
like it's it's not within the realm of

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.759
possibility for a lot of people and for

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.360
other people it's just like

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.360

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.720
possibility for a lot of people i always

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.880
in my head i'm like everybody does it

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.199
besides a few people yeah only the only

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.120
people that don't cheat is [ __ ] this

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.880
different person to person yeah

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.039
disgusting looking people can't cheat

unless they find another disgusting oh

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.600

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.880
are very specific type of dude yeah very

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.120
specific and it no it crosses all racial

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.160
bounds

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.120
yeah

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.360
we have the fat dude in the white feeder

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.160
just transcends race okay so i have this

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.080
so you already got ready for this theory

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.240
right because fat dude and a wife beater

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.240
is part of something that uh so i've

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.599
been working on this theory for a long

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:21.680
time right so you know how the silk road

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.160
the the silk road which was something

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.919
that would spread across uh all the

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:29.360
middle east all these ideas like spices

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.759
uh it was just connecting the world at

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:33.120
that point right

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.479
so

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:36.560
i have some there's a in in these

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.440
communities right there are traffickers

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.880
of information

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.080
yeah right

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.639
i call it the slick road

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.160
it's a bunch of slick talking

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.199
[ __ ] of each ethnicity right

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:51.520
fat dudes and wife beaters are tent

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.680
poles of the slick road

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.199
whoa

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:57.360
dude they are they are full of very

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.280
important information

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.639
yeah you're absolutely right info and

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:02.240
conspiracy theories because when i

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.599
thought about that guy i'm like dude i

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:05.039
was like trying to get last night i was

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:07.280
like these i saw three different days

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.400
three different fat dudes and wife

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.400
theaters almost always with gym shorts

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.680
almost always

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.879
and i'm sitting there i'm like damn did

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:15.520
i sell three different dudes and i go

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.960
i'm pretty pumped that's a good that's a

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.639
good for me my farmer's almanac i'm like

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:20.319
this might be a good summer right well

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:22.000
you know what it is it's because you

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.560
evolve into a fat dude with a wife

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.479
beater a lot if you talk to these fat

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:27.840
dudes and wifey there's a lot of them

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.919
before they were fat a lot of those guys

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:31.360
were athletes which is why they got the

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.000
ball shorts why they got the [ __ ]

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.680
you know why they wearing sneakers every

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.519
day wife beating them because they still

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:38.959
have some of the confidence from when

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:41.200
they were a younger athlete yeah so

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.640
they're out here with just the wife be

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.320

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.760
beater

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.440
and that's why they have so much info

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.880
you talk to them they [ __ ] around tell

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.200

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.680
the 80s it used to be a club down there

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.440
on delaware and he was like it needs to

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.800
be a robot that would come down the

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.240
ceiling and start breakdancing and

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.079
robotic it was a robot on the pool and

00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:51.360
he had come down and danced in the

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.320
middle of the floor and i'm like that's

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.399
a fat delusion yo

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:55.920

you don't know what the [ __ ] i'm like

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.720
they would never make a club where a

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.480
robot falls from the ceiling i'm like

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.160
this technology didn't exist in the 80s

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160
like what the [ __ ] are you saying oh man

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.600
and then i googled it and there's videos

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.079
of it on youtube i'm like yo they really

00:11:10.079 --> 00:11:12.399
had a robot come out of a ceiling at a

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:14.240
nightclub that's slick road [ __ ] yeah

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.399
down on the pole and dance and in my

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:36.079

information on that well it's definitely

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.079
a robot it's not a man and you can when

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:45.519
you see the video you'll see that's an

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:48.000
actual robot but if it was i would have

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.600
loved more if it was a man in the

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.800
costume because i mean he's just waiting

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.560

angry he's like what the [ __ ]

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.120
if you just build a robot to send it

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.839
what the how long was this going to take

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:14.240

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.160
or i would i would attach a suction cup

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.360
basketball court and just loving

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.880
basketball her just like back her down

00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:58.399
there was like a

00:13:58.399 --> 00:13:59.839
trainer or something at the gym i used

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:03.600
to go to on second street and he dude he

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.839
would like stretch the ladies after a

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:08.160
workout and part of the stretch like it

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
was like he was like climbing on them to

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.639
like stretch their leg across

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:13.839
oh yeah he was putting these women in

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:15.199
positions where it looked like he was

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:17.120
penetrating them everything yeah so you

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.480
got it in the middle of the gym with

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.079
everyone looking i was just like this is

00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:22.639
it's crazy that we're all here personal

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:24.079
i was a personal trainer for three weeks

00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:25.600
and i can attest to this

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.120
if you're a personal trainer chicks were

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.160
trying to they would definitely try to

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.480
[ __ ] you yeah yeah and it didn't even

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.839
make sense these chicks were like super

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:32.720
hot

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.480
i would be doing personal training badly

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.360
too

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.480
i didn't i didn't

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.079
i didn't follow a plan dude i made it up

00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:40.240
as i went

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.199
i just feel like uh

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.519
like how many uh 20 yeah every single

00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:52.560
time no idea yeah

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.120
20. were they all fat people no they

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.560
were just like

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.240
it was mostly beautiful women and i had

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.279
one autistic dude an autistic dude

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:02.720
genuinely update that was the [ __ ]

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.440
guy my manager was a [ __ ] dude he

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.639
was like yo i think this i don't know

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:07.680
something's wrong with this guy he's

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.959
creepy i think he wants to [ __ ] me he

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:11.199
was just autistic yeah that was my

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:12.880
manager like he's [ __ ] up

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.440
i was just like dude he's autistic dude

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.160
oh man because he was the guy trainer so

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.079
much of a [ __ ] [ __ ] gym owner that

00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:21.760
you see an autistic person like is this

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.000
gay

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.839
he was his guy

00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:27.199
it wasn't him actually sorry he thought

00:15:27.199 --> 00:15:29.600
the other guy so the autistic guy had a

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.000
trainer and when they found out that his

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.120
trainer wasn't going to be there because

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.480
he was autistic he was like he like

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.480
threw a big fit about it and that guy

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.120
was like oh he's trying to [ __ ] that guy

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.040
that's what it was oh

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.800
even still i mean it's crazy as soon as

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.079
i met the guy i was like he's autistic

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:45.360
yeah because the autistic guy was

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.279
clearly describing the reasons he wants

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.880
him back his schedule got interrupted

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.720
yeah he was kind of like oh man he makes

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.199
me feel seen he you know he listens to

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:54.959
you know he's like those dudes don't

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:56.240
like their schedules getting interrupted

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.920
yeah not enough you toss those guys a

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.519
curveball bro they do not take it yeah

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:01.920
because again like he he is scheduled

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.680
this time each day to feel

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.720
good

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.480
do you know what i mean like the reason

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.519
why they don't like their schedules

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:11.040
interrupted is because what each thing

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.279
in their schedule means it's bigger than

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:14.560
the schedule

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.959
right yeah it's like they you know my

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:18.560
mom used to work with autistic people

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.600
like

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.680
and i would go hang out at the job

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.399
because

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.480
they're fun yeah

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.560
they're so they are fun

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.199
are the best they are the best so

00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:31.120
and and see with them it's like you see

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.639
now you know what it is now everybody

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:34.320
wants to be autistic and it's like yo

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.320
[ __ ] relax true everybody you meeting

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.759
i was like well i'm autistic

00:16:37.759 --> 00:16:38.800
[ __ ] you aren't you're just a

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.000
[ __ ] creep just relax but like

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.320
real autistic people they

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.480
it's like they think so differently from

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.120
us and they focus on like a lot of them

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.600
anyway will be so focused on one thing

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.199
or know so much about one thing it's

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:55.279
like damn like that shows the potential

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:56.880
of how smart you honestly could be

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.199
that's true i've always described it as

00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:02.160
just being 11 years old forever right

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.640
right you just have infinite capacity

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.959
for any like any anything that crosses

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.160
your mind that you enjoy you're just

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.640
like well i'm going to completely

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.600
consume my like normal bandwidth with

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.360
just this thing yeah

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.880
and then i think every 11 year old does

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.160
that and then you grow out of it and i

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.120
think

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.480
there's adults out there that are still

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.679
just like that and that makes sense that

00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:23.439
a lot of dudes with autism will like

00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:26.319
they love they they'll still love

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.520
like

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.520
a cartoon yeah they'll be like now this

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.960
rules and i'm like only watch cartoons

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.000
what are you trying to say right now no

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.840
i'm saying they'll be like a younger

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.960
like

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.400
like ren and stimpy it'll be like yo

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.600
check out renaissance and it'll be like

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.000
like watching it like at work bro i mean

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.679
maybe you move beyond running stimpy but

00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:45.360
the animation is still kind of hypnotic

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.720
and the jokes are still i actually find

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.640
it jarring definitely yeah brandon

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.160
stimpy always put me on edge i'd watch

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.280
it because it's very disappointing oh

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.280
man it was my [ __ ] i know i do go like

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.799
yeah right i still talk about how random

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:56.480
tippy was sick yeah

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.400
you're describing me i know it's like

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.880
you do we

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.919
you're talking bust out your phone

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:10.080
catch a whole episode or whatever it is

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.520
and then i'm like yo we can't work you

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.280
can't do that at work puts it away and

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.200
just goes word for word the dialogue of

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.720
the show

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.640
it's just another level yeah that's the

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.480
man it's that's what i'm saying you're

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.520
trying to be the funnest dude in the

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.200
world it's like you have serious

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.480
competition

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.720
these dudes are fun as [ __ ] bro i went

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.640
to i went to uh i went to catholic

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.400
school and there was this kid there i'm

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.799
not gonna say his name and

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:34.960
uh

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.120
extremely autistic this kid had to hit

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.400
one he had the biggest head i've ever

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.400
seen in my life like he just walked like

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.320
he used to walk and like hold his head

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.240
up with his hands like he would have his

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.400
hand on his head like his head was too

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.919
heavy for his neck so he needed to

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.000
support it with his hand and everywhere

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
he walked he made sound effects but he

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.559
had walked keep like yes

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:57.559
dude

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.919
and i'm like yo this is the most fun you

00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:04.240
could be like you're making sound like

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.840
like if you would like go and [ __ ] with

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.440
him he'd swing at you he'd be like and

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.799
he like he knew he would miss so he'd

00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:11.360
make it like it was an air sam

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.120
and then if he hit you he'd be like

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.280
[ __ ] like he made every sound effect for

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.960
everything he had he had like a batman

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.000
comic bubble in his life

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.039
yeah that's [ __ ] i mean dude making

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:25.039
sound effects while you throw punches

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:27.440
is [ __ ] sick as hell

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.520
oh hell yeah

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.960
which is the double punch at the same

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.120
time

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.760
i mean it makes sense i mean why would

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.240
you not punch him with both arms you

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.440
only hit him with the fifth twice the

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.880
power

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.480
that would be a martial art i would pay

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.640
don't just seeing that level of martial

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.440
arts

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.960
just like

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.480
double head just spaz

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.160
punches like it's a splash punch there's

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.799
a spaz punch and then a 15 degree kick

00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:58.799
kick like kind of stomped when you stomp

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:01.440
someone's [ __ ]

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.880
that's the next move in combo

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.120
the only grappling is like that awkward

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.480
thing where they like they're both kind

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.919
of in a headlock at the same time

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.760
yes you want to see autistic fighting

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.240
refined into a martial arts hell yeah

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.200
into a into a street worthy martial art

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.799
to a beautiful yeah yeah it would

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:30.799
probably dominate dude

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:32.159
because most martial arts were developed

00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:34.799
by like ancient like asian peasants who

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.320
were like they had they were weren't

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.360
allowed to access the website had to

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.640
learn how to like secretly defend

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.840
themselves this is like the same thing

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.880
but with like gamestop managers

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.320
they're just like japanese people under

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.320
feudal lords they're they're in the hood

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.679
fighting for their lives every day they

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:50.400
have to organize like every day

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.000
if the karate chop one of those sensors

not our fault either some people are

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.559
just born in a type of way where the

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:34.720
universe hated you for some reason the

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.640
universe chose and you know what i think

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.640
that's what hell is i think hell i think

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.240
hell is when you die and then get

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.840
reincarnated as something that you don't

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.840
want to be like you just wow you born in

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.279
afghanistan you don't want to be born in

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:47.440
afghanistan

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.600
you you bored are you just [ __ ] oh

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.600
you just you're just a torso you just

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.440
your legs and your arms missing you born

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.440
with nothing this was basically indian

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.799
philosophy

00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:58.159
that's the indian society was set up

00:31:58.159 --> 00:31:59.120
that way you'd be poor and they'd be

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.240
like well clearly you're [ __ ] poor

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.320

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.200
yeah don't look at me

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.640
that was like a big thing it was like

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.799
yeah when rich chris was [ __ ] good so

00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:09.919
long ago

00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:11.760
that makes sense they're probably right

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.519
i think that's that is probably it

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:15.440
because actual hell is there's no way

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.679

00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:19.600
fire and brent i started laughing so

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.519
hard about that the other day yeah yeah

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:23.679

00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:25.360
thousands of years and dudes are still

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.840
that one juvie juvie was perfect for him

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.600

in juvie

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.440
that's one of my deepest like regrets

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.880
was the fact that i didn't grow up and

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.559
drew like juvenile detention yeah

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:11.440
like a whole different life would have

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.799
been waiting for me

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:15.600
yeah juvenile detention is so [ __ ]

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.279

oh yeah you're not obligated to the

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:30.000

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.760
juvie kids go to school with normal kids

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.200
because those kids like you know they

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.079
just

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:43.760
they live in a different type of world

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.440
like they don't give a [ __ ] about it's

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.159
like putting an adult mind into a child

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.839
you see what i'm saying like yeah it

00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:51.520

they didn't study about this they were

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.560
like well we could take juvenile

detention centers and then just sprinkle

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.359

school and they would like get used to

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.200
the ways of like being good and the

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.760
opposite happened those regular schools

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.040
changes the environment and they're

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.400
muscular because they've been doing

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.920

should sprinkle these uh juvie kids into

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.720
the normal school because that's how i

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.800

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.320
it in the bathroom and scooped [ __ ] out

00:36:31.599 --> 00:36:33.520
it at him while he was on the ground and

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.400
that's when i realized that

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.000
there's people out here

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.480

people will destroy you like you can be

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.400
like because in my head i'm thinking

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.400
like yo he probably if it wasn't like

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.760
other people around he might have killed

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.359
him he might have just beat him to death

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:06.800

school because okay i was in a very poor

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.000
neighborhood and we were you know we

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.359
grew up very modestly in that poor

00:39:13.359 --> 00:39:14.880
neighborhood every year on the first day

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.760
of school you were supposed to show up

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.440

single year where i showed up on the

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.440

i'm being honest dude this is my truth

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.520
we would play like so we would play

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.520
catholic schools from like philly

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.680
and like dude we would be like where the

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.720
[ __ ] did these kids go

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.520
i was like we played like saint vincent

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.359
and they had like long pointy nails and

00:40:01.359 --> 00:40:04.240
they [ __ ] stunk so bad dude they

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.040
stunk so bad at basketball we almost had

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.800
to like stop we were like this is [ __ ]

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.560
that could do a sport really well

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.760
i don't know

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.520
dude it was crazy i mean we played once

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.880
again and worked with a school full of

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.960
white children you know

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.040
that that caveat

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.880
no dude this was crazy we played st

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.960
vincent's and i remember just being like

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.280
what the [ __ ]

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.960
it was it was insane it was like it was

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.160
just nothing but pure spazzes dude

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.920
it's like [ __ ] haircuts that you're

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.240
like i've never seen that before

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.240
yeah dude we held onto the rat tail for

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.560
a long time oh hell yeah yeah some

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.800
school some schools did not know how to

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.480
some catholic schools didn't know how to

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.960
recruit from the hood yeah like we would

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.560
i would see like outside the quaker

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.000
schools are better at it by the way the

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.599
quaker schools are great at recruiting

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:54.480
because they

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.920
character character first yeah the

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.960
reason for all those haircuts was

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.000
because there was a rule at catholic

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.480
schools that was no fad haircuts and in

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.160
poor neighborhoods they'd be like i

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.000
can't have cool haircuts it's not an

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.200
option that's all you could get so you

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.760
end up with like a true spaz

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.880
trying to make like a catholic school

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.400
haircut cool makes you look like a

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.319
[ __ ] [ __ ] they basically look

00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:14.079
like the like the franciscan monks

00:41:14.079 --> 00:41:16.319
almost

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.119
it was like not quite a bowl cut it was

00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:21.760
like yeah the sideburn fade into the

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.400
bowl it was crazy it was crazy dude

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.839
seeing that on like a fat wigger with

00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:28.960
just flat bangs across his head

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.040
i mean i'll never i'll never yeah they

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.400
would come they would come into the gym

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.839
basketball season's like december and

00:41:33.839 --> 00:41:35.200
they'd come in and just win breakers

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.240
you're like oh my god we're going to

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.280
[ __ ] kill these guys

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.400
so [ __ ] oh god it sucked

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.599
oh man

00:41:51.599 --> 00:41:53.520
public would you know what though

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.440
public school teaches you more about

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.040
real life catholic school is a [ __ ]

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.640
dream world it's true life isn't like

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.079
that no it's true that's not what life

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:01.280
is like you go to public so you're like

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.119
oh all right i think dream might be too

00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:04.800
nice of a word it's definitely not

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.720
reality but but you got to keep in mind

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.400
he got kicked out for financial reasons

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.119
so

um

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.079
a

00:46:26.079 --> 00:46:28.400
sugar ray leonard in the 80s theory

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.920
holds up dude no i'm trying to tell you

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.680
they're always and again i thought he

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.839
was a liar i googled it and i looked and

00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:35.520
i was like this guy has the same exact

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.480
face as this guy he's just probably 280

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.319
pounds heavier he's got had to weigh at

00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:43.119
least 400 pounds huge he was [ __ ]

00:46:43.119 --> 00:46:43.920
uh

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.520
it made known because he's probably five

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.160
five or five six but he weighed like 400

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.599
pounds a short guy

00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:51.520
fatty [ __ ] i'm like yo he's then he's

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.200
telling the truth this guy fought sugar

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.720
ray lennon it's got it

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.720
it's got to be impossible

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.040
to go from so like to get to that level

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.560
in boxing even if he was like never like

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.319
a great or anyone knew him you have to

00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:04.400
like your life is that to get to that

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.200
point

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.200
it's gotta be impossible to like

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.119
maintain any sort of motivation after

00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:11.200
like the dream oh for sure

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.680
dude you cannot keep up like the same

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.359
lifestyle and you're probably eating the

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:17.680
same way if not more more so [ __ ] hey

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.119
you're going the opposite and a lot of

00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:20.720
them you got to think a lot of those

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.319
guys like i used to box with a lot of

00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:24.800
guys who like now they're fat as [ __ ]

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.640
and it's because like we started young

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.000
like if you start boxing when you're

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.040
[ __ ]

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:32.319
six seven years old and chronic injuries

00:47:32.319 --> 00:47:33.440
yeah and then you can't and then you

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.720
gotta think also you're not on the

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.000
weekends you're not doing the normal

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.440
[ __ ] that kids do you're going to

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.559
tournaments and [ __ ] like that you can't

00:47:38.559 --> 00:47:40.640
hang with your friends you can't if

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.400
you're really into it yeah you can't eat

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.839
candy you [ __ ] probably train it six

00:47:43.839 --> 00:47:44.960
days a week

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.559
so of course when you're done doing that

00:47:46.559 --> 00:47:48.319
[ __ ] you like what i'm [ __ ] eating

00:47:48.319 --> 00:47:50.319
whatever i want i'm never working out

00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:52.960
again that's how that's how i got fat

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.200
yeah that's literally how i got fat my

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.680

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.359

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.240
it's amazing what and then how much of

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.520
your mental health depends on not

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.599
fantasy in a bad way but like

00:49:07.599 --> 00:49:09.200
the dream dude

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.640
cause the whole time the whole time

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.280
you're like i am i the best how far can

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.599
i take this yes

00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:17.359
the day comes that it actually is over

00:49:17.359 --> 00:49:18.640
and you're just like

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.319
[ __ ]

00:49:20.319 --> 00:49:22.000
dude

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:22.960
i think it's

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.800
it depends on it depends on what turns

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.720
you back do you know what i mean like

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.119
for me it was like when i looked at the

00:49:29.119 --> 00:49:31.200
next level how how much harder they had

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.280
to work yeah then i was working to

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.359
achieve what i was achieving it was just

00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:37.200
like nah

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:41.040
yeah you mean like living in jamaica

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.800
that's all the fastest dudes high

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.040
jumpers

00:49:50.319 --> 00:49:52.400
how many times can a person jump in a

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.960
week to get like to be the best you

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.480
shouldn't be jumping because you jump

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.079
off of one leg so you don't want to

00:49:58.079 --> 00:50:00.000
waste too many jumps so a lot of the

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.760
during the week you're not actually

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.440
doing jumps you're mostly doing like

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.359
plyos and stuff to build so you really

00:50:05.359 --> 00:50:06.800
aren't sure until the day of you're like

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.800
okay what kind of numbers well that's

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.520
wow that's crazy kinda yeah yeah but you

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.880
you can feel it like you know how your

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.880
workouts went you know what i mean and

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.720
you can feel like how your body is is

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.880
like tuning up towards the day of the

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.800
it's like a pitching arm

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.000
right

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.839
yeah i would imagine yeah yeah cause

00:50:23.839 --> 00:50:25.839
there's a lot of whipping motion in in

00:50:25.839 --> 00:50:27.920
the jumps and that's why like everybody

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.200
gets their like their lower backs [ __ ]

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.280
up they pull their abdominals and [ __ ]

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.720
i think i got a lot of jumps left in my

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.839
legs

00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:35.119
do i

00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:36.880
probably went 10 years without jumping

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.559
really yeah i can't say i can't say the

00:50:38.559 --> 00:50:41.200
same do you got thousands of jumps left

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.559

00:50:42.559 --> 00:50:44.160
excited to use them no i'm not i'm lying

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.319
same so i keep a fresh vert what's your

00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:26.480
ver what are you working with i would do

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.160
probably at this i would say like

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.720

grew up with at my height i was a

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.440
43-inch vertical

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.319

say like 20 yeah 20.

00:51:53.359 --> 00:51:54.800

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.760
measure

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.040
do you measure how far your feet come

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.480
off the ground yeah

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.319
yeah two foot or one foot vert

00:52:06.319 --> 00:52:08.800

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.920
after this and slide in the page to see

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.680

hell yeah i'm with that i feel like the

00:52:15.119 --> 00:52:17.040

speak english yeah yeah no i swear to

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.160
god i'd have like math teachers i would

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.760
look at me like what's the point of this

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.880
so that's what i was doing i was like

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.880
where the [ __ ] what is your major

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.599
and he wouldn't tell me his major so i i

00:54:53.599 --> 00:54:55.040
gleaned from that what did you think

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.200
would you would you dude it was like

00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.680
it had to be math in order for me to let

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:01.040
it slide that he didn't speak english

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.799
you're an engineer if you're yeah

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:05.200
engineer math you have that i guess you

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.599
don't but anything else dude you have to

00:55:07.599 --> 00:55:09.040
have a mastery of the language to get

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.799
the degree yeah yeah and he wasn't

00:55:10.799 --> 00:55:12.960
telling me his major and i'm like i

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.960
[ __ ] i knew it and so it ended up

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.720
being um we ended up finding out i ended

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.000
up finding out that his major was some

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
sort of history

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.920
yeah he was in

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.920
at a school in america studying history

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.160
so he could talk dude he was eloquent

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.280
yeah good

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.440
[ __ ] yeah he got just

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.200
got me and i mean i didn't find that i

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.280
didn't find that out for like a while

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.799
because i was so interested did you ever

00:55:34.799 --> 00:55:38.160
like slide in and cook you excuse me

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.640
what if he was doing a study on you [ __ ]

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.880
dude he probably was i observed the

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:47.480
behaviors of a black man in america

00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:59.680
[Laughter]

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.400
said ruin black indian relations this is

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.799
a wildly popular research paper they get

00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:08.400
[ __ ] up in america because of me
