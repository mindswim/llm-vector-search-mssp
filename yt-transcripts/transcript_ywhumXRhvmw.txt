00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.439

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.479
like the it's the same thing as me

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.360
freighty cat spin on it he'll be like

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.880
well these buckets we have the shock

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.920
load absorbing because we have like

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.439
hoses running up for the air like for

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.040
the compressors yeah he's like we'll go

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.479
with the shock load of these hoses they

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.320
were way over the weight limit and we

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.920
could just flip it in and we're 120 feet

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.000
i'm like dude shut the [ __ ] up

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.840
you're a [ __ ] black cat dude shush

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.520
he's being a stupid cat don't talk about

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.200
it that's afraid when you're up 120 feet

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.560
in the air you don't talk about falling

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.759
i'm talking about falling don't talk

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.360
about shock loads and [ __ ] i'm like dude

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.799
there's people way smarter than you that

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.800
figure this [ __ ] out we're fine

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.160
nice

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.840
we could possibly the shock load could

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.440
flip us the other way it's like dude

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.280
shut up

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.800
if we die we're [ __ ] we're dead

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.640
you're [ __ ] einstein and this [ __ ]

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.239
isn't gonna help us you're not gonna

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.920
crack the [ __ ] physics of this it

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.200
could

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.400
doubt it you get hit and roll

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.599
but it's scary you're up 120 feet and

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.280
you're like you're in a basket so like

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.360
you're kind of steering it so you hit

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.800
the lever and you only want to go two

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.599
feet

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.680
but the machine's 120 feet away from you

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.440
so you you think you let go in time but

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.879
you let go and the machine keeps moving

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.319
with the wind and you bank into the

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.400
stuff it's [ __ ] scary god dude i'm

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.760

upstairs to use the bathroom and when i

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.000

slapstick dude and the way i felt

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:55.440
because this the stairs were soaked and

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.279
my feet just went out and i just slid

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:59.680
down on my butt in front of all these

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.560

and he also

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.840
unlocked the ps3 he was 17 years old

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.640
damn now he's fighting against uh

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.240
[ __ ] what's that guy's name who does

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.640
tesla

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.880
who's that boy elon musk elon musk yeah

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.799
so he was beefing with musk

00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:44.720
he was saying that he's gonna have a

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.360
self-driving car before musker damn and

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.440
he's just doing it using uh like cell

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.880
phones so like you have a cell phone

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.240
that's recording the road so he's

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.760
teaching his ai

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.760
to drive through like

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.000
like recorded videos of the road i don't

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.360
know how they function he's doing it

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.720
yeah so how good you tried to explain it

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.480
though yeah exactly it's uh it's more of

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.640
a learning based model

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.720
so it's pretty sick that's uh that

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.240
reminds something you said remind me of

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.679
that that's something i don't want

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:11.840
people to do is to race to see who can

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.840
get the self-driving car out first three

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.600
years out dude get ready no i need

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.960
somebody to be like well you want a

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.720
level one or level five i don't care

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.000
what the [ __ ] it is

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.200
level five's gonna cost a hundred

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.320
thousand dollars make sure they didn't

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.000
rush the production on this thing the

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.760
race is on dude i'm not in some [ __ ]

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.440
self-driving car that well what's gonna

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.520
happen is it's happening in five years

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.880
so the dust is going to settle and

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.559
you'll see who the winner is yeah in

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:34.000
five years five years what do you think

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.520
moscow the

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.360
guy the other guy

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.760
otts i think otz has a better model

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.919
because musk was they're like whatever

00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:43.200
they come out with in five years when it

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.640
costs a hundred thousand dollars so like

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.320
i can get your car self-driving for

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.840
under a g

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.520
you understand

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.919
he hacks he like hacks your car's

00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:53.200
computer system

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.440
and then you just drive it's sick dude

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.880
i mean i appreciate that you go for it

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.280
yeah yeah it's it's nice that you try to

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.440
get into the science get ready dude it's

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.600
coming dude i wish i remember the [ __ ]

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.960
he was talking about it's so funny

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.240
because the guy interviewing him was

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:10.960
like

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.880
well does chevy really appreciate the

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.159
fact that you're like kind of reverse

00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:15.360
engineering their systems and like

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.559
adding your stuff into it and he was

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:17.919
like you can't think of it like that

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:19.679
dude you bought it it's yours yeah

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:21.360
whatever you crack you hack it whatever

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.880
you want to think of it like that he's

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.320
like but you know he's got a point yeah

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.360
he's like he's [ __ ] yours that's what

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.200
he said with xbox he was like [ __ ] it

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.720
it's yours you want to open it and steal

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.000

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.520
your right and everyone's like

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.120
well that part's not yeah that was his

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.880
whole argument his whole thing is that

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.799
like no one should own data or any sort

00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:38.000
of information

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.520
so he's like all of his stuff's out in

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.400
the public

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.919
puts bounties out he's like crack me the

00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:43.840
chevy cruz get me the code for that give

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.440
you 10 g's you're gonna crack a cup i'm

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.880

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:51.200
under the wires dude start [ __ ]

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.960
get my electrical tester and be like yup

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.480
that thing's hot the battery's

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.840
definitely working

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.480
oh man speaking of uh

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.720
explaining things properly yeah and

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.200
improperly i last podcast showed my ass

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.720
a little bit what happened just me

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.080
trying to [ __ ] be like you know what

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.600
slavery uh

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.280
what'd you say what did you say

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.080
like

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.000
because i went into the argument of

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.080
how it's funny that

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.600
you can't be like well the irish had a

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.400
bed

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.159
without people being like shut the [ __ ]

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:21.360
up yeah and it's like that's why

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.440
true that's i mean i get

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.260
you see this is exciting

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.320
[Laughter]

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.280
it's so hard to explain this um

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.120
it's like because i have heard [ __ ]

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.840
retards say that about like

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.360
like if somebody's complaining about an

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.200
injustice that happened to black people

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.400
and then they're like yeah well the

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.760
irish had it bad you don't hear us

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.840
complaining it's like yes that's wrong

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.760
that's a stupid thing to say

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.600
but to say the irish people had a bad

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.919
historically is totally correct yeah

00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:51.760
you're that's not wrong

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.360
you can't compare them

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.559
it's one of those things that's like

00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:56.240
just impolite more than anything you got

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.600
to forget about the facts and dating

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.760
it's got to go that's kind of impolite

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.120
that's it's like you know that's all

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.559
it's like eating it's like eating before

00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:04.880
the people all sit down

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.480
yeah i don't know if you can say

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.679
anything if you're talking about

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:10.400
historical data is impolite yeah but

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.000
people from people's reaction that's the

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.360
thing it's not it has nothing to do with

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.039
historical data you could be like dude

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:16.400
this many people died then they would

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.039
just be like enough knock it off yeah

00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:20.640
it's just politeness

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.080
yeah but it's people that don't know the

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.000
data you farted that are like you

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.120
basically

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.960
oh yeah of course it's it's a bunch of

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.720
people like we were just watching cnn

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.240
and that lady was

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.919
trying to dissect general kelly's

00:24:31.919 --> 00:24:33.520
statements on robert e lee that was

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.279
[ __ ] funny uh i think he should do

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:36.799
his research on the civil war maybe

00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:39.279
watch the movie glory dude literally

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:41.440
that was verbatim which is funny

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.440
it's just it's crazy

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.600
yeah that's a sick move dude that's

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.600
almost like what being a black lady and

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.520
be like uh excuse me general kelly why

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.520
don't you study your history and watch

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.840
the movie glory i know

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.440
it's like

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.679
that's not and everyone's like very good

00:24:57.679 --> 00:24:59.840
point thank you well it was funny to

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.679
watch the other ladies it was two white

00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:03.360
ladies two blonde white ladies and a

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.360
black lady and as soon as it's a cnn and

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.640
as soon as like the issue came to race

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.320
they were the white ladies just

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.679
literally just almost moved out of

00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:12.720
camera like

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.919
yeah yeah she was like well actually

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:14.880
blah blah blah blah blah and she gave

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.480
you a little thing but yeah that was

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.080
it's a pretty bad point bringing in like

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.080
referencing a hollywood movie

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.480
possibly weinstein production too

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.559
hopefully probably i think harvey

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:26.400
probably [ __ ] diddled he probably

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.799
produced denzel and [ __ ]

00:25:28.799 --> 00:25:30.960
[ __ ] ferris bueller to get that fair

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.200
bill dude fair buell probably caught one

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.720
he probably yeah ferris bueller

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.320
definitely you think he did yeah you

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.799
don't think denzel did nah dude no

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:40.000
that's why he had to play a villain

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.360
before he got an oscar he never got he

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.960
never did any of their [ __ ] stuff

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.039
because of racism exactly he had to be a

00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:47.039
bad guy to get an oscar he couldn't get

00:25:47.039 --> 00:25:48.880
diddled

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.279
no you're not [ __ ] apologizing dude

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:52.640
what you're not apologizing for your

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.039
behavior i'm not doubling down yeah [ __ ]

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:57.039
it i just know

00:25:57.039 --> 00:25:58.320
it's when you get into something like

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.080
that and you don't explain it well you

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.080
just come off like a [ __ ] idiot dude

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.360
my whole thing is even if you explain it

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.000
flawlessly which the facts are just not

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.320
live but at least then i have something

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.000
to stand on instead of me just down here

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.799
like oh [ __ ] irish people had a bad

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:14.480
what the [ __ ] so you're gonna say you

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.320
need to research your final word better

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.400
i think i did research it the last time

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.760
because i was like because i just

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.080
watched that [ __ ] black-ish musical

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.720
i said now you

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.600
oh [ __ ] uh anthony anderson the guy

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.840
the main character on that he got caught

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.080
he got a little rape rape actually a

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.400
little back in the day what happened um

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.320
was it like celo level where he got

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.559
caught like slipping people molly this

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:41.200
is the report i read okay i cannot

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.440
speak on its uh factuality probably a

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.960
right-wing extremist trying to bring him

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.000
down after his performance i think it

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.279
was in the trailer in his movie trailer

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:51.360
for the movie hustle and flow

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.159
a young lady was invited into his in

00:26:54.159 --> 00:26:56.080
another man's trailer where their

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.120
immediate immediately uh derobed her

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.480
against her will

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.919
and started taking pictures of her like

00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:04.559
while they're groping her and she was

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:06.559
screaming so loudly that somebody heard

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:09.200
it and got her out of there that was her

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.120
that's what she said that's what i read

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.520
yeah wow that's the that's the guy who's

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.760
singing slave musicals on abc right now

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.320
well yeah i mean

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.520
that's the worst part about this

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.120
ultimately not the worst part but a bad

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.799
thing too is people looking for to like

00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:26.559
actors for like their sense of moral

00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:27.840
clarity and it's like dude these people

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.679
are empty [ __ ] like yeah exactly

00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:31.440
that's what bothered me the most about

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.279
four or five [ __ ] millionaires on

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:34.400
stage

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.960
like but even we are slaves

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.960
but actors though yeah actors in my

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.640
experience my limited experience hanging

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.640
out with actors they're [ __ ] kind of

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.360
brutal yeah like i i have a couple of

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.039
like actor friends who like write stuff

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:49.279
on facebook and it's just like what we

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:51.600

regurgitate it you're not you're not

00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:55.440
really in this business for your

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.039
original [ __ ] thought bro the scene

00:27:57.039 --> 00:27:58.960
where at the end of that musical anthony

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.559

yeah that's true for these [ __ ]

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.360
actors to be like

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.640
the railroads we built it

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.399

now with like

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.159

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.720
years ago oh okay so he got

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.200
grandfathered in like a little bit of uh

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.039
yeah groping you could grow up in the

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:08.320
90s

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.840

hunt those terrorists [ __ ] anthony

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:22.159
anderson could get away with a little

00:29:22.159 --> 00:29:23.840
he probably saw the towers fall and he's

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.960

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.200
work on [ __ ] jailbreaking these cars

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.760
dude self driving

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.960
my car

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.760
my car self drives it just it just pulls

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.320
all the way to the left yeah it's trying

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.679
to take you somewhere i gotta debug the

00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:35.279
software but it just literally pulls me

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:36.559
right into the shoulder

00:31:36.559 --> 00:31:38.960
the o3 civic was rocking too much

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.200
software there's some software it's not

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.000
oh i got the digital dash self driving

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.039
digital

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:46.080
do dash

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.679
dude i got an 08.

00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:50.000
oh it's oh yeah bro oh that's an obama

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.440
era civic dude yeah dude i think you've

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.039
got all the computers loaded with i

00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:54.559
could probably if i drove that into a

00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:56.159
river would probably turn into a boat

00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:58.159
it's probably amphibious give it a shot

00:31:58.159 --> 00:32:00.480
it's an amphibious vehicle while you're

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.440
lifting

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.919
i told you when i [ __ ] try to uh i

00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:05.120
talked about that before when i was

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.720
doing a little like

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.799
uh doing like an amateur acting short

00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:10.320
and i drove into an embankment right

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.519
afterwards yeah yeah

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:16.080
yes so yeah so it couldn't handle the

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.080
rough terrain it couldn't i thought it

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.600
was equipped for like more like lunar

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.000
style terrain but apparently it does

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.840
look like some sort of lunar doesn't

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.600
dude in the honda civic if you have an

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.279
oh yeah that the year they turned all

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.799
like rocket managed and like space

00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:30.399
shippy where they have like a slanted

00:32:30.399 --> 00:32:33.279
kind of weird setup there's a bar that

00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:35.120
like like a plastic bar that separates

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.039
the driver's side window from the

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:39.039
windshield and it's it's like the

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:40.720
perfect blind spot for pedestrians like

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.399
i've almost hit so many people because

00:32:42.399 --> 00:32:43.840
of it yeah we got a lot of complaints on

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.840
that did you really i sold hondas yeah

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:46.640
dude

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.159
it's insane yeah what are they going to

00:32:48.159 --> 00:32:50.159
do for that they got rid of it did they

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:52.159
yeah a lot of civics a lot of cars don't

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:53.760
have that i almost hit people constantly

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.440
because of it and they it's they're just

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.880
like right there pretty much

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.559
had a bad one how many people got

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:00.799
[ __ ] gunned down so many could you

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:03.760
hit someone then sue honda for that

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.279
i mean that's a poor design if you're an

00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:06.480
idiot yeah

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.519
[ __ ]

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:08.960
go hit someone dude

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.840
i'll tell you when you're gonna hit me

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.600
on my left cheek yeah but actually

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.120
nothing's fresh we'll sue honda and

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.799
split it

00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:16.240
it's not bad

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.559
now we're cooking how fast can i go

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:19.840
i could probably take it i'm gonna hook

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.360
up i'm gonna hook up the self-driving

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.360
software

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:29.519
shut them down dude you think you're a

00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:31.760
big tech crunch guy i love tech

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.440
you love tech and science love tech i

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.200
just again i'm still in the infancy

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.640
stages of me being able to explain it

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.679
but i love tech explanations tough it's

00:33:39.679 --> 00:33:41.120
hard you're like you're like somebody

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.399
who's good at math that just can't show

00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:44.640
their work basically

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.480
all the answers that was my move in math

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.159
what's that well i would say i would

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:50.720
copy i would copy every algebra equation

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.840
and just be the teacher like well how

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.760
did you get it i'm like i just [ __ ]

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.360
like pieced it together and i just said

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.960
anything do another one right now and

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.240
i'm like nah

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.440
i'm like this is a different type of

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.679
problem i can't i just cheat viciously i

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:03.279
told you that time that my teacher made

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:04.799
me take the test

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:05.519
so

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:07.679
every math test the class before us

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:09.679
would take the test yeah and then

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:10.800
somebody would put it in their

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.800
calculator what all the answers were so

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.320
not just going to the test and they were

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.560
[ __ ] multiple choice

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.040
he would use scantron for our math tests

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.480
so it was perfect it was so you had

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.480
multiple choice math that was [ __ ]

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.760
well just one guy one grade and then uh

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.440
i was out the one day they took the test

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.040
so i had to take take the test again he

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.200
gave me a different test that was actual

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.079
work

00:34:32.079 --> 00:34:35.440
and i didn't this was like mid-year zero

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.679
i got a zero i didn't i didn't even know

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.679
how to show the work on anything i wrote

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.000
three for the answer on every single one

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.079
i just wrote the number three under each

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:46.000
other oh that's so [ __ ] funny yeah

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.919
when i would cheat in math so i would

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:49.359
look get the answer be like cool and

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:51.440
then i would structure my own fake work

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.960
to like how i figured it out it'd be

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.639
like all kinds of crazy [ __ ] numbers

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.680
and like scattered around like scribbles

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.440
i already did this but don't worry

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.240
equals

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.079
three remainder two

00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:06.079
i was [ __ ] sick at math no you

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:07.760
weren't you oh she didn't know how to do

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.599
the work

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:11.599
this is like your space

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:13.760
this is like your [ __ ] tech knowledge

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.640
now but my mom i had uh i used to read

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.640
encyclopedias when i was little oh man

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.320
we had the encyclopedia britannica and i

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.599
used to read about outer space when i

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:23.599
was little it's serving you well but i

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:25.520
would literally just like

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.640
we didn't have the shooting star

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.560
conversation on this no no he didn't i

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.880
was making fun of my friend uh for not

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.880
knowing if we were looking at the stars

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.880
and we saw a shooting star and he looked

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.160
at me and was like

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.560
is that really a star shooting

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.599
i thought it was the funniest thing in

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:41.280
the world yeah and then i told it to

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.800
matt and matt was like

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.359
wait that's not a star

00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:47.599
no i figured you know you know weirder

00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:49.280
things happen in space

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.599
true wormholes

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:53.280
you got some words you got some good

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.520
words you know

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.599
quantum fields how many planets are

00:35:57.599 --> 00:36:00.160
there in our solar system uh well how do

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.000
you stand on pluto pluto's out are you

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.880
serious yeah i walk right now

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.720
answer the question dude this isn't math

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.520
you can't just hide your work

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.119
well now there's 12

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:13.119
there were 13.

00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:14.240
well are you talking about there's other

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.079
ones they've been finding too you know

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:19.520
what planet x the sub nebula

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.359
i don't know how many planets i thought

00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:23.520
it was like eight or nine there was 13

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.599
uh pre-or little pluto thing now we're

00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:27.440
down to 12 planets i thought it was

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.720
eight or nine

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.560
nine let's see how many planets hold on

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.800
dude this is this is big for the pi i i

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.520
i have no idea all right let's

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.320
find it out in real time

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.119
good pause for the listener i know you

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:45.359
hear me type into nine planets there's

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:46.800
nine there's not 13.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.480
i'm counting more like exoplanets and

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.480
moons and stuff uh there were nine now

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.920
there's eight

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.680
yeah i'm counting more like exoplanets

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.280
and moons you have all those exoplanets

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.320
rings all right we're going to take a

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.720
solar and lunary uh eclipse quiz right

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.680
now no it's a fifth grade level quiz i

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.960
don't know anything about it click here

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.560
to take the test where it's going down

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.760
right now bro

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.119
which of the following best fits into

00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:08.640
the blank an eclipse is defined as an

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.040
astronomical event that occurs when one

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.280
celestial object moves

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.680
next to in bangkok and back of top of

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.880
the shadow on top of

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.440
were you reading me multiple choice

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.800
answers there at the end yeah yeah

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.640
there's a blank

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.320
when it moves what were they what were

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.359
they next to in back of into the shadow

00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:32.000
on top of

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.839
into the shadow

00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:37.040
well wait no it causes the shadow

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.000
uh

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.240
i'm gonna go into the shadow

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.599
okay

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:43.760
i'm going on top of

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.200
submit oh we didn't [ __ ] pick an

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:45.800
answer right there

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.680
[Laughter]

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.320
well what does it mean by on top of i

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.720
don't know what dude

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.200
you're [ __ ] internet sleuth you're

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.440
terrible at it what like the the we

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.440
needed jamie to do the resources you use

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.359
to find data on the internet i'll take a

00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:03.119
fifth grade [ __ ] test

00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:05.520
you clicked like a click bait

he's another one of those types where

00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:21.599
like he went to harvard and got out and

00:39:21.599 --> 00:39:23.440
was like he was the author of four hour

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.720
work week

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.000
he's like i'll show you how to work in

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
four hours it's like his whole thing was

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.560
like he his big controversial take

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.880
lately was against inbox zero

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.040
okay you know what inbox zero is so

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.520
having nothing in your mail correct do

you would you do you support inbox zero

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.160
or do you not support it having nothing

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.760
in your email just getting all of it

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.200
getting all your emails sorted out and

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.720
you have inbox zero

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.079

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.920
wasted waste of time dude who cares

00:39:59.359 --> 00:40:01.119
what i hate about him is that he has

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:02.960
this uh

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:03.920
he has a whole thing where i was

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.119
watching an interview with him and he

00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:06.880
was like well i was actually suicidal in

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.839
college

and they're like really so was everyone

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.839
yeah his whole thing was like yeah but i

00:40:11.839 --> 00:40:13.920
like i planned out how to kill myself

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.440
and then like my business took off and i

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.320
was like

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.920
if anyone's ever at that point like you

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.920
don't have to do it and it's like

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.240
that's it dude you were suicidal

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.599
suicides aren't like i have the business

00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:27.280
brewing i should kill myself no it's

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.440
like i'm addicted to drugs and i just i

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.520

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.680
sad and i don't know why it's like dude

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.280
the way he tried to kind of use that to

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.480
be like

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.000
you know i was gonna kill myself and

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.400

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.400
it's like all right dude [ __ ] yeah don't

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.480
use it i hate that to be like

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.560
when people insert autobiographical

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.160
things into their life they're like oh

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.839
that's when i almost killed myself it's

00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:51.520
like how'd you do it his whole thing is

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.640
like i don't want to say it's like it

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.320
was such an elaborate idea i don't want

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.079
people copying it it's like

00:40:56.079 --> 00:40:58.400
oh my god right

you think so i hope

00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:06.160
no he's he seems too stupid to do it it

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.839
would be

00:41:07.839 --> 00:41:10.640
to have one of those guys on camera

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.720
[ __ ] ice themselves would just be the

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.920
ultimate

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.599
irony i love gary vee if he killed him

hundred percent of the shots you don't

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.240
[ __ ] take and then he killed himself

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.520

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.119
computer coding recently

did like a free coding academy and i got

00:43:02.319 --> 00:43:04.160
like three clicks of the thing and i was

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.280
like this [ __ ] you couldn't even

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.280
operate the website

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.480
i could i couldn't figure out how to do

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.400
like the free tutorial it was like

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.560
telling you step by step what to do and

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.400
i was like i don't understand the steps

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.599
that's the basic training dude then you

00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:17.040
got to weed out the [ __ ] people that

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.800

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.079
learn how to i'd like to be sick if i

00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:21.760
could code

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.200
that was pretty much inspired like i

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.480
started hacking dude i could figure out

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.599
stuff and it was just like what would

00:43:25.599 --> 00:43:28.160
you hack into if you could credit card

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.000
yeah you could immediately do credit

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.240
cards

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.319
i've hacked my credit card a couple of

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:36.240

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.639
would hold up in any court of law but it

01:23:32.639 --> 01:23:34.480
was nearly because it was funny as hell

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.920

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.440
