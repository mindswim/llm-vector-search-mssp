WEBVTT

00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.240
you're a gay entrepreneur

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.760
but no i think i just imagine you made a

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.279
habit of smoking you know what it is you

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.799
were saying earlier about all the neural

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:08.480
pathways being open when you're young

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.559
yeah i think the gay one closed early so

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.080
all the gay ideas i would have ever had

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.599
if i had been gay are all coming to me

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.280
in this moment true we all are born with

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.400
one yeah i've had so many heterosexual

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.000
entrepreneurial ideas over the days but

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.840
none of them have ever had that like

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.359
like the hot boy idea just came to me

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.400
right now that closed you unclogged your

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.640
gateway yeah

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.720
like yeah it's like opening up a whole

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.640
new world you're like yeah

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.079
because they call it brain mapping by

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.079
the way yes the different neural

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.320
pathways that that close

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.040
through lack of use yeah yeah and uh so

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.559
you end up with

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.360
like a map of what you need yeah they

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.120
call that brain mapping it's like a ski

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.800
slope that's what i read in uh michael

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.800
pollan's book how it's like at the end

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.559
of the day on a ski slope everyone goes

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.480
in the same paths

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.079
okay so your thoughts are doing the same

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.000
thing since like for years you've been

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.079
going down the same loops yeah

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.840
eventually you don't use the other ones

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.840
and you just immediately naturally go to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600
that that's why you like get mad about

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.479
the same thing over and over yeah you're

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.479
because your brain's just like

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.920
that's a that's a very western

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.280
interpretation of something that's true

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.119
yeah i'm being a materialist for this

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.159
did you want to very lesser

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.840
interpretation of sounding yourself you

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.119
want to hear something kind of [ __ ] up

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.759
i a guy sent me a screenshot of a story

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:22.479
and

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.439
it's a completely paralyzed guy

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.439
was uh he couldn't even like move his

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.680
eyes but he was alive and conscious

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.439
he's that [ __ ] up they gave him like a

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.520
normal implant and now he can

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.200
he can think

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.119
one letter per minute and he's like

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.960
writing messages and stuff so dude

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.640
imagine like the way

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.320
their perception of time would change if

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.360
you oh

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.640
it was close so what are his messages

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.560
saying uh he said he wanted to listen to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.560
two

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.960
[Laughter]

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.159
oh yeah this was like getting chaired

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.280
around a lot this is the guy that asked

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.640
for a beer every from in his coma

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.119
but oh so he was conscious before

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.640
yeah i think you're saying he was born

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.800
no this dude's in a coma

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.920
and the only thing that could help him

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.160
was

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.239
[Laughter]

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.080
god that does sound sick

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.720
imagine being in a coma

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.040
damn that would rule dude oh man i

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.959
always thought tool was the spookiest

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.959
band it's four it's four people in coma

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.680
dude listen to this

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.720

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.400
and alice in chains were the spookiest

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.599
things you could listen to house and

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.440

yeah

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.519
yeah i guess marilyn manson was an early

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.879

people think of marilyn manson when he

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.720
came out that must have been scary it

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.840

manson t-shirt once in a blue moon

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.159
though now or now back in the day you

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.959
see them at the mall at the mall

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.840
a marilyn manson black dude

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.000
school bag with like a top hat written

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.599
all over it and [ __ ] yeah dude a black

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.680
metal had changed my life

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.159
like he was sick at basketball really

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.000
yeah that's how i met him he was sick of

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.599
basketball

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.439
killing people on the court damn and

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.840
then when we were leaving he

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.080
took his sweaty t-shirt off

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.000
jacked by the way yeah and then he put

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.720
on a [ __ ] marilyn manson t-shirt damn

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.720
he sounds like the man yeah he was the

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.840
[ __ ] man did you ask him were you

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.280
like what's up do you have questions are

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.200
you like five songs i just [ __ ]

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.799
walked off the court backwards i was

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.000
like my mind was so [ __ ] blown what

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.519
i had to recalibrate everything i knew

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.079
about the world dude yeah

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.840
that was some wild [ __ ] man yeah that'd

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.359
be great that's a big deal that was a

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.560
big statement back then to wear a

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.240
marilyn manson t-shirt yeah he was on my

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.840
team too yeah i was kind of saying like

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.720
i'm okay with school shootings

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.199
it was kind of being like it'd be like

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.040
wearing like a uh

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.800
it was basically being like nah that's

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.400
not that big of a deal

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.560
yeah i could see why they did that

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.160
yeah but he wasn't he was in it like i

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.080
talked to him later he was in all the

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.639
hardcore [ __ ] yeah yeah all the all the

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.560
different rocks at the time

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.479
that rules yeah

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.000
that must be funny though to find out as

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.240
a black did you love metal

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.600
no one's important at first a lot of

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.280
people are not going to support it

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.880
well that so that's another interesting

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.800
thing about the black community is like

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.280
you have to have one thing in your life

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.400
that is

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.880
nobody [ __ ] with so then you get to

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.199
do you that's what's up those are also

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.360
dudes that really get fixated on white

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.400
girls at an early age

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.240
marilyn manson black dude yeah

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.280
yeah i feel like if they hear that

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.390
double bass like

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.479
[Laughter]

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.560
yeah yeah the first time you see like a

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.840
metal dude with like a pretty hot

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.320
girlfriend it does rewire something in

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.000
your brain yeah

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.600
true just get they get exposed to that

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.960
too young

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.280
and it flips that's a sick life path

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.440
just like metal um it has to affect

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.440
everything you do yeah dude i know dudes

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.880
that are still metal

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.919
what do they do

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.680
they [ __ ]

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.080
just play metal and listen to metal yeah

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.600
tall boys

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.759
yeah they always get cowboys they get

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.360
down they like i don't know some of them

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.560
have like families and [ __ ] and they're

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.400
still just like metal as [ __ ] like

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.680
everything they do

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.680
[Laughter]

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.680
are they are they rules

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.800
how would you rate their health are you

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.560
jingling a bottle in there yeah i'll

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.280
play with a can stop the fabric i'm not

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.720
this is [ __ ] fidgeting i don't know

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.080
they all they're all like pretty well

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.479
adjusted yeah yeah metalheads are

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.080
usually like very well mannered like

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.080
exact slightly autistic nice people

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.479
still still i guess kind of wild dudes

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.479
but like really like yeah they kind of

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.400
have to have that dichotomy so that

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.919
nobody can be like dude you got to stop

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.199
being metal

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.360
that's true yeah true avoidant

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.440
intervention like if you hang on to it

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.960
long enough you can kind of like

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.720
stabilize and be like oh yeah i can

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.080
adapt this to

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.000
you know yeah a lifestyle while people

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.840
aren't begging me to change i feel like

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.840
it's yeah i feel like if you wear like a

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.360
button-down shirt spike your hair and

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.120
have like a carabiner

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.240
people like yeah i guess we could leave

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.360
them alone

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.639
that's a metal i feel like that's a

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.400
functional metal head of like i mean

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.240

i'm gonna get a hand pan we need a hand

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.480
pan the flute and then just some like

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.959
shaking percussion yeah that would be so

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:45.200
nasty people maybe get a girl making

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.480
like vocal noises yeah

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.200
yes

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.880
last time i took acid i thought about

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.880
that for like three hours while pissing

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.080
my pants

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.519
i was like that would be the funniest

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:59.040
thing but i was thinking of having a

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.040
band like that that we were only

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.120
connected by taking acid so like i would

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.200
take acid like in pennsylvania and this

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.399
other dude would take acid like out in

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:08.079
montana and he would get the signal to

00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:09.440
get his drum

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.120
so that we'd be playing like thousands

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.200
of miles away from each other

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.800
but then they'd all be meeting so i

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.880
thought dudes were doing this

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.959
to get me through my acid trip and that

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:21.440
i was now in their club whoa i mean

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.720
while laughing the whole time

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.760
so

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.399
side note so [ __ ] funny it was the f

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:30.160
and i kept like i was thinking about

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.640
like dudes stepping out of rvs and like

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.320
taking off [ __ ] skin caps and getting

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.160
out their flutes and like licking their

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.200
lips and like i was laughing so [ __ ]

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.760
hard by myself all across all across the

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.839
just like a world like a bat signal was

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:45.680
just dinging yeah and they'd be like oh

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.079
[ __ ] tom's on acid in the woods

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:49.920
go get your handpan

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.360
and you like assemble they'd be like

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.290
okay brothers go it'd be like some woman

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.040
[Laughter]

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.120
some like very white woman that's real

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.720
into native culture

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.160
like steps outside of her house and

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.120
starts like dancing

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.880
this might have happened it might have

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.360
happened no after i came down

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.800
the guy told me that there was a church

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.720
camp like three miles through the woods

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.200

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.079
[ __ ] funny

they're like the avengers

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.920
of like some dude

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.959
approaching 40 on acid in the woods

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.160
in the woods oh [ __ ] that was tom did

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.760
you tell them i didn't tell anyone that

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.279
that literally happened it was probably

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:36.320
the most profound thing that ever

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.560
happened that i just never told anyone

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.480
what happened while i told my wife like

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.880
i saw someone blow a red light

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.079
i saw a guy

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:45.760
so we wanted

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.800
we wanted to try two cb two cd

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.560
so tom got his hands on somebody brought

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.800
up to my house on like a monday morning

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.120
and we went for a walk in the woods

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.079
and just tripped like mildly 2cv was

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:00.160
like very chill very chill highly

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.320
recommended yeah but we ended up walking

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.720
for four hours for the entirety of the

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.920
of the trip

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.200
all through this part and like there was

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.639
people walking around it was like it was

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:10.399
nice there was like a creek trail

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:13.040
there was geese and ducks it was nice it

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.480
made everything very we were running

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.720
with spud that area yeah yeah yeah and

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.120
then on the way back we saw

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.440
uh across the creek there was this tree

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.360
with like a thick branch sticking out

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.760
and it was what was very clearly a

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.920
deer skeleton that had been like it was

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.079
like it was a full deer skeleton like it

00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:33.519
was what yeah whole rib cage spine

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:35.040
hanging from the tree hanging from a

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.519
tree like it got stabbed onto the brim

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:39.839
or like impaled holy [ __ ] and we were

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:41.440
staring at that we were like whoa are we

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.040
misunderstanding what we're looking at

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.240
right now

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.680
and we were trying to theorize what

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.440
happened and tom was like maybe he got

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.680
hit by a car like i don't

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.920
like launched like he got home run into

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.959
the woods by a car

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:56.399
or like he got hit by a car and like

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:58.240
fell down a hill and rolled onto a

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.839
branch or something maybe i don't know

00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:01.839
anyway we we could definitely see the

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:04.560
rib cage we do it as a carcass

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.560
and then we're walking

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.399
for a little while this is on our way

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:09.839
back so we're more than halfway through

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:11.040
the trip and we're coming back to my

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.839
house

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:14.880
and we see tom spots a i thought it was

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.760
a fox but it was a deer standing in the

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.160
creek and it was like the water was like

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.120
up to its like up past its legs and we

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.800
couldn't tell if it was dead or not like

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.240
it was it was stiff as a board yeah what

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.000
but it like it didn't look like it was

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.360
like decaying at all it looked like it

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.440
could be alive so we're staring at it

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.440
and it's not moving at all and then we

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.040
see that it's hitting we fully decided

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.600
it was dead yeah and like it just got

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.440
stuck in the water or something so it's

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.760
snout like its nose its nostrils are

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.240
above the water so we're like we're not

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.199
we can't we're trying to see if it's

00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:48.399
breathing or not

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:50.720
and then uh so we throw a stick down and

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.320
it moves

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.399
like just splash near it right yeah yeah

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:56.639
and it moves slightly and then we can

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:58.639
see like it looks like it's like gulping

00:13:58.639 --> 00:13:59.519
water

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:01.199
so we're wondering if it was just super

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:04.800
thirsty so stupid what so stupid and

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.079
then it submerges its nostrils and it's

00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:09.040
like

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.079
just holding its whole snout underwater

00:14:12.079 --> 00:14:14.399
it killed itself meanwhile just like

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:16.480
mildly swaying back and forth

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.240
what the [ __ ] yeah it was real skinny

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.040
too

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.480
and we're just watching this happen

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.839
we're like dude is he trying to kill

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:24.079
himself and then tom again goes maybe he

00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:26.959
got hit by a car

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:29.440
and he could wander over yeah

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.399
and

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:33.199
uh so we're watching and eventually tom

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:34.720
says something really funny before we

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.079
leave it he goes

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:37.279
just maybe he's just at the end of his

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:39.680
rope man

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.160
anyway i found out later it's called

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.480
chronic wasting oh they get this like

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.240
illness and then they have it for like

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.240
two years and then it activates and they

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.480
just starve themselves what did this

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.000
thing killed itself in front of us it

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
was insane we just gave up on life as

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.920
we're tripping there's another one in

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.440
front of a deer watching it drown but

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.440
two cv's so light that we were both like

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.720
yeah we can handle this yeah we wouldn't

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.639
got a meal yeah like if we were all

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.480
mushrooms i'd still be crying yeah

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.199
there's another weird uh like a mad deer

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:08.240
disease

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.920
where they go [ __ ] they start to lose

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.600
their mind and go crazy and one of the

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.600
symptoms of it is they they can't quench

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.839
their thirst damn damn that could have

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.199
been it too

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:20.000
okay this thing drank itself

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.600
