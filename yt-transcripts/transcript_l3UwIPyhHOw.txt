them is by fighting the loopholes and

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.960

now you have to stop swimming what are

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.360
you gonna do with that and i was like

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.880

looked it up and worked my way back

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.440
you can't apparently so cbd inhibits

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.720
seizures

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.520
but thc intent also inhibits seizures

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.240
but in ten percent of people

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.479

doing standing i might lay down for

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.600
stand up for the road

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.520
a lot of guys are afraid to just bring a

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.440
couch on stage and lay down

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.039
i mean dude it would trump sitting on

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:22.640
the stool and kicking people out would

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.840
be so sick

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.320
get them out

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.520
take that and then fall asleep for like

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.760
20 minutes

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.520
then just you'd have to get a you have

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.440
to get beers like a long straw

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.480
[ __ ] beer hat one of the hats just

lay here yes

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.760

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.919
yeah

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.640
i actually planned on uh sitting up as

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.400
soon as the podcast started but things

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.520

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.799
things are going pretty well you're

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:52.240
comfy i think there's gonna be some

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.000
negative comments most likely about my

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.760
physique and the fact that i need to lay

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.280
down to do a podcast

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.640

system that they purport to be attacking

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.919

00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:01.520
their uh state capital is the old

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.880
confederate capital

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.720
really yeah as soon as i saw it i was

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.240
like oh [ __ ] that's the confederacy you

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.080

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.960
and i was and then when i was on stage i

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.039
was like oh you guys got a cool uh

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:14.400
capital that never used to be anything

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.200
else did it and they were all like

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.480
they're all sour foods they were so

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.159
[ __ ] sad dude imagine if you're

00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:20.880
trying to be woke

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.480
in the [ __ ] heart of the community

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.159
enrichment yeah the capitol

00:23:24.159 --> 00:23:26.000
come out every day and you're like and

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.400

uh it may have but they might have moved

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.320
it to in front of the i think it's just

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.360
in front of the capitol

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.679
really ironically enough it's like 30

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:41.200
yards away from like a

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.080
civil rights monument well that's

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.600
probably it's like a school zone

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.919
you can't have you got to keep like at

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:49.039

00:31:28.159 --> 00:31:29.840
dude and it's not it's not a big thing

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.840
it's scientific it's just the universe

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.360
is inseparable

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.200
if you take all of the life force of

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.120
every single being and connect it with

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.039
the entire universe as a whole

00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:41.519
that's brahman dude it's just an ideal

00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:43.039
it's an ideal you can meditate toward

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:43.840
and you know

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.679
connect yourself to meditate towards

00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:47.360
that we're all connected

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.480
we are it's it's i mean it means i was

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.039
asking that

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.880
yeah the plan is it's all it's a you

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.799
know it's a single thing

00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:57.679
we are we are a one consciousness

00:31:57.679 --> 00:32:01.279
experiencing itself as each other

00:32:01.279 --> 00:32:02.799
that's just my beliefs i'm intensely

00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:04.399
it's just my epilepsy dude i hate that

00:32:04.399 --> 00:32:05.200
you [ __ ]

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.730
i'm gonna [ __ ] have a fit dude

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.960
[Laughter]

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.720
but yeah man it's you know people say uh

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.480
you know what do they say

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.760
a bunch of things that we're like a

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.960
bunch of things that are changing where

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.200
we're just change that's thinking bro

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.880
yeah come on that's what i always say

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.399
come on man you know that

00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:22.000
the word thing's changing dude if you

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.440
think about it

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.960
so you know because you're a materialist

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.440
you're a mechanistic materialist

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.760
yeah that bothers you i don't care

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.360
but you're a materialist so you would

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.799
just say that i'm

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:36.880
i'm missouri bro you better show me

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.159
you're conscious

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:40.000
so you would say that consciousness just

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.399
emanates off of the tissue

00:32:42.399 --> 00:32:44.960
and it's just like a just a fluke that

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.919
happens to come off

00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:47.600
off of our like mechanical brain

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.760
processes yes

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:53.600
yes so yes so if we're just then

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.159
just matter and tissues and we produce

00:32:56.159 --> 00:32:57.760
consciousness

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.480
and so does other you know fundamental

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.919
elements that we are you know the same

00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:03.440
thing as so the universe in that level

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.640
would probably be in that

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.200
vein is also conscious this is not this

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.039
mirror is not conscious

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:11.679
not itself but i'm saying if if you're

00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:12.799
if we're just you know again

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:15.679
as a materialist if we're just material

00:33:15.679 --> 00:33:17.519
elements you know we're water or this or

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:18.799
that and we somehow produce

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:20.159
consciousness which is just a fluke it's

00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:21.120
nothing serious just

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.360
trapped in our brains it's not like a a

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.200
thing like a magnetic force

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.799
that we somehow just experienced you

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:28.799
know what do you mean

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:31.120
so what do you think it is if it's just

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.000
yeah no

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.279
it could be an external thing that we're

00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:35.360
picking up on yeah a magnet can't

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.760
comprehend magnetism but it's still like

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.519
attracted to it you know consciousness

00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:41.760
might be a field i don't know

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.440
i mean you're asking me and if i'm

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.720
hanging out with my hindu friends we'd

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.360
say

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.720
yeah it definitely is you did have some

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.559
hindu friends in college i did dude

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:49.840
i didn't know what dude i look at indian

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.760
dudes at all now yeah i'm like this is

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.200
the [ __ ] you guys are brought up on this

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.080
[ __ ] rules

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.000
yeah they got a good one it's [ __ ]

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.360
it's so sick dude

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.760
yeah it's so sick so that's your third

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.200
eye picking up on that

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.880
is that your consciousness no man that's

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.840
your doctor when you're getting in the

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.880
right environment

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.320
that's wrong knowledge and that's dude

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.360
that's where i'm with you you don't

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.960
believe in anything you can't

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.879
see or reason out or have a reliable

00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:13.119
witness yeah there is the whole pantheon

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:14.639
of like all those things but that's just

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:17.200
you know that's just a that's mythology

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.679
bro what do you think george w bush is

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:21.119
think he's a materialist or do you think

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:22.960
he's a hindu

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.280
what is george satan i'm whatever dick

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.399
cheney is

00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:28.399
which one is he deepest dude you hear my

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:29.760
question though if

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.159
we're just then biological material

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:33.919
producing the fluke of consciousness

00:34:33.919 --> 00:34:34.480
then so

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.000
are other things too we just we wouldn't

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.240
know like an entire galaxy could be

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.280
conscious then

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.560
because it has what is what are our

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.560
brains run on water tissue

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.440
electricity you got water in the cosmos

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.000
you have like

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
you have plenty of [ __ ] electricity

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.520
yeah so why could those things might be

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.639
conscious too that would you know

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:53.359
what if there's no water there is on a

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:54.480
planet

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.440
i mean that wouldn't that wouldn't be

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.639
part of the planet that would be a

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.160
different node he doesn't get to think

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.040
it's not the planets

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.280
so pluto doesn't get to talk it might

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.720
dude i don't know all i'm saying is i

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.760
don't know

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.000
i don't know i don't know if they don't

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:06.880
if they're talking

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.320
i don't know either dude do you think

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.079
rocks are talking when we're not looking

00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:11.440
the crystals are self-organizing

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.800
structures but they're not they don't

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.079
talk do you think they could they

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:15.599
grow themselves yes what if they wanted

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:17.280
to chat a little communicate with each

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:17.680
other

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.200
they might like please talk plant

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.119
students plants plants yeah i saw that

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:21.760
happening

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.200
yeah you know what's going on i know all

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.800
about it dude yeah dude secret life of

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.280
plants

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.720
but i'm you guys show me dude i look

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.480
again i don't know for sure but that's

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.000
my theory right now i'd love to debate

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.800
sam harris

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.119
i would murder harris would butt [ __ ]

00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:36.000
you dude there's no

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.839
i can't think of a if consciousness is

00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:39.280
just something emanating off of just

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.880
purely physical

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.960
characteristics and why wouldn't i think

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.000
you you need to

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.720
define consciousness the best that

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.680
nobody can

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.800
aha well the best you can nobody can yet

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.400
what would your what's your working

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.079
definite like what have you had to try

00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:54.720
to define

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.160
consciousness because then we can

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.079
discuss who has it and who does

00:35:58.079 --> 00:35:59.920
the life energy of the universe dude the

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.920
life energy of the universe

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.760
so you have there's dude your brain you

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.960
have a brain right

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.599
obviously and there's just this the

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:08.800
lights come on

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.240
and it gets filtered dude oh my god dude

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.440
it's like you know like a sea turtle

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.800
when they come out they all they come

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.320
out of the thing knowing what a hawk

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.119
looks like

00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:20.960
hal dude how do they know that yeah

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.640
they know that if you flash a chicken by

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.480
them they don't move you flash a hawk

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.680
they're like holy [ __ ]

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.000
yeah you have you have like little

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.440
things in your brain that are just ready

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.720
to roll at all times

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.160
but then you have this the lights come

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.839
on that's consciousness

00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:35.359
it's awareness and then you kind of

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.720
paint it with like your you know

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.920
built-in

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.760
mechanism so like you're talking about

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.119
like instincts are different than

00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:42.560
consciousness

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:46.240
yeah big time okay big time so

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.079
do you think animals have consciousness

00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:50.720
then on top of their instincts

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.440
not like humans do no yeah not like

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.800
humans do

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.760
sure but yeah i mean they haven't

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.040
demonstrated that no

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.119
so animals are almost purely insane

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:02.480
humans have another level

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.839
yeah i remember i got bummed out in

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:05.599
catholic school for that

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:08.320
they said dogs don't have souls that's

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.599
some [ __ ] and i was like yeah they

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:10.000
do

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.200
yeah i know they do they have

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.119
personalities and they were like we all

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:14.560
they all they're just instinct i was

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.400
like so are we

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.400
we're only instinct that's how i feel

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.480
about us we can be that's how i feel

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.160
about human beings we're also

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.240
just instinct you're freudian dude

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.240
perhaps i am you're freudian dude

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.520
i'm jungian perhaps i am freudian my mom

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.480
is looking tight

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.800
maybe i am freudian but yeah that's my

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.359
uh

00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:38.720
oh maybe there's a good answer for it

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.400
but yeah i would [ __ ] you better

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:49.040
it's just awareness awareness awareness

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.560

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.240
instinct yeah it is

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.920
awareness is different than it is

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.440
animals have awareness

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.240
they do so they do it but they're not

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.680
self-aware

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.960
okay and they can't like

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.640
run simulations through i agree with

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.000
that they're also there's people who

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.160
don't have a mind's eye too

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.599
there's a there's a condition of people

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:10.800
some you know some of my fellow brain

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.320
disordered individuals

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.520
who can't picture things in their mind

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.680
really i watched a thing on it yeah they

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.800
were watching a thing and they're like

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.400
the one dude was like 15

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.839
and as he was watching tv and they're

00:38:21.839 --> 00:38:23.359
like now imagine like picture this in

00:38:23.359 --> 00:38:25.280
your mind and he was like

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.560
he went down to his dad he's like dad

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.160
can you like see things when you close

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.760
your eyes he's like yeah why he's like

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.480
[ __ ] oh no can't do it he's probably

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.200
lying

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.440
i i was wondering that too he sounds

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.560
like he's fibbing to be

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.160
somewhat of a i was wondering about that

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.160
i was like dude is that a lie

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.000
but yeah dude maybe i can't maybe i

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.440
can't either it's awareness to you i

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.480
don't think about it i can't see

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.320
anything in my head let me say

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.960
picture me [ __ ] picture i can see you

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.160
dude i can see you naked

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.000
exactly you must have a brilliant mind's

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.400
eye i mean we have our pineal glands are

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.240
obviously calcified but

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.320
that's not our fault our white pineal

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.280
glands yeah

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.200
if you need melanin to decalcify your

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.720
pineal gland oh

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.040
so that sounds like kind of what the

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.720
people who own slaves used to say about

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.839
like when they got into like

00:39:07.839 --> 00:39:10.240
craniology or whatever that is what do

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.839
they say what is that is it craniology

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:12.640
yeah

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.599
like they're the bigger on white people

00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:16.960
because we're smarter

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.400
they had a whole thing now they're doing

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.480
that against the whites i like it

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.880
oh yeah it's pretty tight but they uh

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.079
they're

00:39:24.079 --> 00:39:25.119
yeah they used to do a thing where they

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:27.440
said they could like measure like

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.880
a dude's forehead they when they were

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.160

a while

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.000

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.359
to towns and be like we're just like

00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:34.560
helping you guys out and they'd be like

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.000
taking measurements like criminal

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.119
yeah minorities reported or they would

00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:42.720
even like poor immigrants

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.839
poor white immigrants they would come in

00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:45.200
yeah they were minority they would go in

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.280

rap about getting [ __ ] no they're

00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:04.559
like i think telequality is not a [ __ ]

00:50:04.559 --> 00:50:05.359
rapper

00:50:05.359 --> 00:50:07.200
really yeah i don't know i don't think

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.400
he really raps about like murdering

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.839
people though

00:50:09.839 --> 00:50:12.240
i think he's like he is he's like he's

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:12.880
like a top-notch

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:17.200
lyricist i'm more of a chief keefer

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:20.000
i'm more like how many bodies you have

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.119
yeah

00:50:21.119 --> 00:50:23.359
where are you trapping except for j cole

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:26.640
he's righteous as hell

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.480
he talks about he would trap him when he

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.319

00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:31.200

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.599
it's like whatever he had millions of

00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:24.960
dollars knock yourself out

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.280
it's the the brand of humor and i was

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:28.240
watching like the jokes

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.000
like stewart's thing was funny as [ __ ]

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.520
colbert's thing was like

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.880

00:58:04.799 --> 00:58:05.200
like

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.480
people are getting their [ __ ] like taken

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.760

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:08.480
like

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.480

right yeah it's like you know whatever

00:58:12.799 --> 00:58:13.280
but

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.760
that's [ __ ] pretty nuts yeah i was

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.760
kind of bummed that it was the lab

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.480
really i liked the guy munching a bet

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.040
yeah i mean

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.599
i liked that story that was a fun story

00:58:23.599 --> 00:58:24.880
i suspected lab

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.440
i mean yeah yeah true pretty clearly it

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.319
was

00:58:28.319 --> 00:58:29.520
what was it like i thought that got

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.880
debunked i thought the guy eating it

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.160
back out debunked like

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.160
early it did and then we were like okay

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.599
so it must be the lab and they're like

00:58:35.599 --> 00:58:36.160
no

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.760
yeah called pangolin like no it wasn't

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.480
as a penguin and then they were like

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.960
okay and then the guy who owned the wet

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.240
market

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.359

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:55.200
heroin and everyone floods the block

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.000

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.240
tough to listen to

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.599
especially because he always goes into

00:59:49.599 --> 00:59:51.760
ads like in the middle of things

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.440
like what's he selling the democrats the

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.960
cities run by the democrats

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.799
are falling apart they're terrible

00:59:56.799 --> 00:59:58.319
they're crime-ridden why don't we just

00:59:58.319 --> 00:59:58.960
