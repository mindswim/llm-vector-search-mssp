was dating an island boy

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.680
and she got kicked out of her house

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.160
because there was an ak-47 island ball i

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.960
had an ak-47 and apparently

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.720
he was beefing with someone and like the

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.240
person came to the house who also had a

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.080
gun that's why the cops came and he got

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.720
deported back to the island

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.080

a lot of times i've uh

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.519
you know i've talked to people who

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:28.560
aren't white and they say they have a

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.920
hard time

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.279
trying seeing the difference between

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:33.440

liquor you want to go to the store that

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.399
has someone who's not white because it's

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.320
like it's harder from the gauge how old

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.760
if you're not white it's like you're not

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.279

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.839
separate women because i wasn't sure who

very very good place taiji acucare

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.120
they

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.639
it was a great massage but i was at the

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:46.079
oldest trick in the book dude they got

00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:47.600
it

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.639
but at this place i don't know if they

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:50.560
do this other places but they stand at

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.160
the register what happened when did you

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.839

00:14:58.959 --> 00:15:01.040
and i had two tens and i truly did not

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.959
know because one was my masseuse and one

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:05.519
was waiting for her client and it's

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:07.519
the male madam whatever his title is is

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:11.279
the one that rings you up yeah yeah

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.360
because the sir is ringing me up and i

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.959
didn't there's a male madden there yeah

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:16.720
he's the guy that runs it like he has i

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.320
i guess he speaks the best english

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.920
really so he handles all the phone

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.079
transactions handles all the financial

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:24.560
transactions too gotcha so that place is

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.480
probably running tight

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.880

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:50.160

you're not getting me [ __ ] jerked off

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.040
while i'm supposed to i was just

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.320
stepping out real quick to get a

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.600

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:29.600
boards

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.360
a hand job is the logical end of a

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.440
massage that's the point of a massage is

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.839

you know that's what they call it that's

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.319
why they call it a logical ending that's

a logical ending

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.079

rehydrated and you listen to the music

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.919
and you sit in the chair yep that would

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:38.559
be the space for it true

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:40.240

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:04.559
up and down and i just started getting

00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:06.480

trying to [ __ ]

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.880
day one so my brother hit me in fifth

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.400
grade with like an absolute conundrum

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.760
where he was like

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:53.120
i wasn't [ __ ] fifth grade he said i

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.120
not not gay

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.880
and i was just like

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.320
[ __ ] dude literally there was a 10-day

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.919
period where i was like i [ __ ] might

00:23:11.919 --> 00:23:13.360
be gay i was like [ __ ] dude that's

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.960
probably when those astral demons found

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.039
out fred just passing by and heard tom

00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:19.679
talking dude gay [ __ ] about you maybe

00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:21.919
tom probably did an astral ceremony that

00:23:21.919 --> 00:23:23.600
tipped them off like listen guys man's

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.799

they're the best

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.880

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.480
their heads

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.720
was it because like were they worried

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.079
about her getting traits was she like

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:29.839
not old enough to sign an mba i still

00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:31.520

she was that's like nutrition three she

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.920
was probably four

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.200
so i had my four-year-old daughter

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.640
sitting

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.960
inside the conference room at ramada uh

while this like 45 minute presentation

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.200
went on and they started what did she do

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.040

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:47.920
there

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.599
now full now that i think about like i'm

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:50.720
not just saying this because i sound

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.400
like an awful person but my my wife

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.760
might have been with her yeah that would

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.040
make more sense because i don't think i

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.800
would leave her by herself i'll verify

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.920
with my wife

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.760
but when they start blasting the share

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.960
song

yeah working at a place like that does

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.079
change you so it's like the fog of war

00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:38.000
sets in within a couple weeks yeah i'm

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.760
telling you it takes away all the magic

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.440
when you're around a great like a friar

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.839
and you start like you know see like

00:42:43.839 --> 00:42:45.359
just the nasty how much like bugs and

00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:47.040
[ __ ] dude honestly i feel like little

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.280
caesar's is what made me racist

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.760
really working there because

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.119
there used to be a bus stop right

00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:54.319
outside of there

00:42:54.319 --> 00:42:56.880
and it would close at like 9 30 or

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.440
something and my buddy ran the place so

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.880
he would make he made me the assistant

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.800
manager pretty quickly just because

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.680
i wasn't an absolute [ __ ] yeah and i

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.599
would close by myself and at the bus

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:09.599
stop at that time there would be like

00:43:09.599 --> 00:43:11.359
just full of minorities and they would

00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:12.880
come in and ask for free soda all the

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.240
time and i was too much of a [ __ ] to

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.280
say no

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.960
but it became so overwhelming that i was

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.319
getting done later and later because all

00:43:18.319 --> 00:43:19.680
these minorities were coming in asking

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.079
me for free dr pepper

00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:23.920
and that's when i felt actual actual

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.560
hate toward my authority

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.520
oh my god dude

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.200
so think about it

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.880
an entire black neighborhood thought

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.560
they had a cheat code for little seasons

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.160
like there's a guy who will just give

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.480
you free soda

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.839
the thing is you have to go right as

00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:47.040
they're closing

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.079
you got to line out the door

00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:53.880
dr pepper kitchen dude

00:43:54.079 --> 00:43:55.520
so when did you finally work up the

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.119
gumption and be like

00:43:57.119 --> 00:43:58.000
no

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.599
i did not dude i quit fill me up

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:05.119
no i will not fill you up anymore dude

00:44:05.119 --> 00:44:07.280
the syrup's low i was getting done so

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.200
late because they would all come in and

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.960
i just couldn't say no to these people

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.560
so i would give everybody a free cup of

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.400
soda and there would there would be no

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.560
less than 10 people getting free sodas

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.920
and when i'm shutting all the [ __ ] down

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.680
by myself like that's that's like an

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.640
extra like 20 minutes where i'm putting

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.540
giving them cups

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.119
[Laughter]

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:26.640
so i was getting able to impress no ice

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.079
did anyone have the gumption make noise

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:30.560
no nobody did i might have let an

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.599
inbound fly at that point

00:44:33.599 --> 00:44:35.599
but it was getting later and later and

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:37.680
that was a major contributor to me just

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.319
turn back time

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.520
but if you had been like sorry guys

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.119
no free sodas

00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:47.119
it wouldn't have even occurred to me to

00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:48.079
say that

00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:50.000
i was that big of a [ __ ] [ __ ] and it

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.400
just slowly built of just that there was

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.160
a guy socked his wife out front of the

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.240
store one time and i had my buddy hoff

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.680
uh who was the delivery driver as soon

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.520
as i saw him sock sock the lady

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.880
everybody's like oh my god and i said

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.160
huff go lock that door

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.520
i'm just so scared that the man will

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.040
come in and turn it that's what free

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.480
soda did

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.040
like man i'm [ __ ] marching

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.680

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.440
she was robo-doping me dude i needed to

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.839
quench my thirst within 32 ounce dr

00:45:17.839 --> 00:45:19.040

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.160
thirst dude

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.640
you can't be mad at them

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.160
it was the voice dude that was the voice

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.040
of [ __ ] god being like sprite

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.160

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.079
yes father well it's fair i mean that's

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:33.440
you know i appreciate the honesty of

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.880
coming in and being like you know it

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.680
created bad feelings to get just

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.200
i mean you probably must have gotten

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.079
some pretty sick compliments though

00:45:42.079 --> 00:45:44.000
these people weren't very nice really

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
yeah it was maybe a thank you like here

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.640
and there or like an exclamation of

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.800
excitement more than any like compliment

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.640
or anything like that but

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.560
but it was bad and i'm glad that's not

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.000

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.720
actively trying to fire so every day he

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.400

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.920
him pick it up and try to get him to

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.200

vicious stutter so you're going there

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.119
jacuzzi is a tough word when you have a

00:49:33.119 --> 00:49:34.960
starter dude

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.000

so we had a stutter stuttering jacuzzi

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.920
salesman and you know he had one

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.760
employee he didn't like very much the

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.440
other guy who was his main man for the

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.920
maintenance was [ __ ] uh the main

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.119
maintenance guy

00:49:53.119 --> 00:49:54.319
had gotten

00:49:54.319 --> 00:49:56.000

days you know

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.480
his business failed so he was a pretty

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.160
he was actually he was really good at

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.000
working but that was uh

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.839
that guy would come home i would do

00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:09.359
maintenance with this guy and he would

00:50:09.359 --> 00:50:10.960
just like he would the guy had no idea

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.400
what he was doing or like the dude who

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.319
hired us so the maintenance guy was

00:50:14.319 --> 00:50:15.520
pretty smart he would get all his jobs

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.280

00:54:03.599 --> 00:54:05.359
mural of his self

00:54:05.359 --> 00:54:07.920
boss man's paradise my my revenge plan i

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.440

personally as an employee at like a

00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:12.800
bunch of places then concoct like

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.079
revenge plans

00:54:14.079 --> 00:54:15.920
so like you know i would pillage cash

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.480
registers the places i worked at but

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.319
this you know this is a service thing so

00:54:20.319 --> 00:54:22.160
my big revenge i was going to go into

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.520
buzzfeed i would do i was very sad on

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.880
this i was going to infiltrate buzz

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:26.079
man's paradise because i knew when they

00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:27.599
weren't around and take all of his

00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:29.599
liquor out of his bar in this outside

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:32.400
pool whoa but that's some prank man that

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.680
wasn't a prank

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.920
dude i hated buzz man you [ __ ] call

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.680
my boss on me dude accuse me of cooling

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.880
off it was like i wasn't cooling off

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.520
dude it was a sweltering day too so my

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.119
case didn't look it my case didn't look

00:54:43.119 --> 00:54:44.640
so good it's pretty surprising that he'd

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.640
be so willing to be such a buzz

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.240
kill

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.599
well i mean i did step into that that's

00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:51.520
like the garden of eden dude i was in

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:53.280
buzz man's paradise

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.799
i jumped in [ __ ] i mean it's probably

00:54:54.799 --> 00:54:56.240
pretty normal for him

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.520
to have someone fully clothed that's

00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.870
like that was powered head behavior

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:00.720
[Laughter]

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.119
it's it was [ __ ]

00:55:03.119 --> 00:55:03.920
so

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:07.760
back to the massage

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.440
what happened besides that she squeezed

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.119
your butt cheeks that was it and she

00:55:11.119 --> 00:55:12.720
like pulled them apart and she says oh

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.640
it's so sore so so how does she know

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.559
your butt was sore i don't know and like

00:55:16.559 --> 00:55:20.000
to me like i interpreted that as like do

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.400
you want to get jerked off like yeah

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.359
you play around with that a little bit

00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:25.040
yeah it's yeah did she look into your

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.640
[ __ ] like a jeweler it's like the

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:27.510
island

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:31.400
[Laughter]

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.839
that is very funny it's so sore i think

00:55:33.839 --> 00:55:35.599
that was a vocabulary slip up i think i

00:55:35.599 --> 00:55:36.720
think she was trying to say you're so

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.000
tense

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.760
you have a tense ass your ass is telling

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.119

00:55:41.119 --> 00:55:43.599
itchy butt that week i did not oh man

00:55:43.599 --> 00:55:44.880
yeah that would be a great service if

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:45.599
you can go somewhere and get a

00:55:45.599 --> 00:55:47.040
professional butt scratch when you have

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.480

the two separate ladies they do this

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.079
thing where like they'll pull your

00:56:06.079 --> 00:56:07.920
underwear down like four inches so that

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.160
it's like they can access the glutes

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.760
yeah just like so that your underwear is

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:12.960

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:13.920
your body it needs to get massage

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.319
question to you is have you ever seen

00:59:04.319 --> 00:59:06.319
any kind of nasty carnage with kids at

00:59:06.319 --> 00:59:08.480
playgrounds as such

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.680
that was pretty for me i was like that

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.280
was a pretty nasty carnage and i was

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.440
like damn yeah you know what to me

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.280
nothing i've seen like a lot of other

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.119

00:59:17.119 --> 00:59:19.200
to live there was a basketball court

00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.799
where older kids would [ __ ] with younger

00:59:20.799 --> 00:59:22.640
kids on bikes nice and i think i'd just

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.240
have like a thing for kids getting hurt

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.599
on bikes so i guess i'd be afraid to say

00:59:25.599 --> 00:59:28.799
i'm a convicted pedophile

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.440
what do you think tim you should wrap

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.599
this up

00:59:33.599 --> 00:59:35.440
now dude the i guess i think the most

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.200
[ __ ] up kid thing i saw there was a

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.440
kid in my neighborhood who had a um his

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.880
dad built him a ramp and my wife and i

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.319
were going for a walk

00:59:42.319 --> 00:59:45.440
and um he was he was riding his bike off

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.599
of the ramp and he fell off of it and he

00:59:47.599 --> 00:59:49.200
landed like his chin hit the ground

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.880
first

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.079
and that was the most [ __ ] up thing

00:59:52.079 --> 00:59:53.680
like there was no like tricks involved

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.440
yeah but it was just he really [ __ ]

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.799
ate it hard did he go off the top of the

00:59:56.799 --> 00:59:58.799
ramp or try to [ __ ] out off the side no

00:59:58.799 --> 01:00:00.880
he he went off the top but i i he just

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.040

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.160
that

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.319

i think to this day she probably has

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.680
like there's probably a good number of

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.039
people that she like has to pretend

01:06:21.039 --> 01:06:22.720

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.000
tough

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.679
what was like the rumor in your school

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:11.199
because for us it was just the kid got

01:09:11.199 --> 01:09:12.640
they somebody started a rumor freshman

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.120
year this kid rapture was jerking off

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.719
and it haunted him for the next four

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:19.120
years hey where was he jerking off they

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.319
started a rumor that they caught him

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:22.000
jerking off in the stalls because at our

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.600
high school we didn't have doors on the

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.040
stalls

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.880
say what yeah there were no doors in the

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.839
stalls

01:09:27.839 --> 01:09:29.279
so somebody said they walked past in

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:33.400
this case school at veterans stadium

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:36.080
they removed them all it pissed troughs

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.000
in the uh classrooms damn if you took a

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.159
dump it was just it you had a

01:09:40.159 --> 01:09:42.880
it's like trusting one another true yeah

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.960
but yeah they caught them fapping

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.080
i don't think they i think they were

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.359
just blind that's why i would wear a

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:50.560
cape i would just hold up my [ __ ]

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.159
that [ __ ] and probably look over the top

01:09:52.159 --> 01:09:53.679
too like don't look at me i'm pooping in

01:09:53.679 --> 01:09:55.040

was a bathroom in our high school that

01:09:56.719 --> 01:09:57.840
was like

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.840
i think a staff bath but it was a solo

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.440
people i found about that like my junior

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.800

dude i swear to god i think i have type

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.120
2 bipolar dude i started it in a good

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.760
way but i started a i had the idea i was

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.040
doing a solo cast i'm like i should do a

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.239
book club

01:13:58.239 --> 01:14:00.480

and i'm still going to do it i signed

01:14:02.239 --> 01:14:03.760
myself up to do a book club the first

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.440
book 700 pages i'm like i'm [ __ ] i

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.040
woke up three days later i'm such a

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.800
dumbass [ __ ] idiot and it's like it's

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.360
like super complex like ideas i'm i've

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.120
read the intro like four times dude it's

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.719

01:14:14.719 --> 01:14:16.560
my solo cat the thing i do on patreon

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.880
it's just a solo it's just gonna be

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.159

01:14:20.159 --> 01:14:21.360
mix a bunch of different stuff in there

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.800
but part of it's gonna be whatever book

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.400

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.159
give you ever you know blinkist

01:14:26.159 --> 01:14:27.760

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.600
of do like you can listen to like the

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.679

very short in summary so you can just

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.719
absorb the knowledge of books you should

01:14:38.719 --> 01:14:39.760
think about doing these live from

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.960
