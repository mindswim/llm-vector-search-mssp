00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.750

good and then you start talking but I'm

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.850

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.589
second because I'm not really sure how

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.510
I'm doing to be honest with you cuz I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.090

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.030
pretty worried about the pandemic that's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.799

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.920
do not go outside order do not go to the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.810
beach and you go light a campfire it's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.149
very very secluded yeah I'm staying away

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.259
I'm not talking to anybody I'm not

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.790
touching anybody we're very secluded

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.060
yeah yeah that's good I mean you're not

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.710
you know you're not in the epicenter

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.259
right now you're out and you're out are

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.299
you so of mineral liner yeah I'm in

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.000
South Carolina just [ __ ] around yeah

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.280
this is crazy you know I'm in Los

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.560
Angeles at home and you know it's it's

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.229
one of those things where I'm taking

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.080
this pretty seriously because I've been

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.680
I've been read

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.819
everything on the Internet I've been

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.469
reading everything like reading

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.180
everything like everything I've been

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.489
reading and so if you read everything on

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.340
the internet you know one day it can be

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.150
feeling like Oh a flu no big deal

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.989
exactly

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.389
yeah and then the next day the next day

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.930
you're terrified but the more I read the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.120
more I realized that we're supposed to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.769
be terrified right now this is not just

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.000
the flu and I've been you know three

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.359
days before the before the whole thing

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.389
went down where they told everybody did

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.370
not leave their houses no story three

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.470
weeks before three weeks before I

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.180
stocked up my pantry with you know my my

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.909
kitchen the word pantry so I sound

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.730
really Canadian you know but yeah so

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.079
I've got some sardines here I'm not sure

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.700
how much I'm not sure how much of the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.790
video portion of this gives you used so

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.040
starts our team sardines are high source

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.239
of protein which is good I'm not sure if

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.680
I should be showing off my sardines

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.260
that's when the looting starts this is

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.579
the first place they're going to come

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.459
for my delicious sardines but you know

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:47.370
you have weapons we've got some chili

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.819
some chili it's good lots of

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.519
non-perishable items rice is important

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.479
to have rice lots of rice I I didn't I

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.069
was worried I was gonna run out of rice

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.689
if this thing goes on for a couple of

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.889
years so I ordered I ordered a 10 pound

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:10.979
bag of rice and the thing that's

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.989
interesting is I actually never used

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.359
Amazon until this whole thing started

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.880
which is weird

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.909
I'm not a Boomer I'm a Generation X okay

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:24.990
yeah so are you going to eat what what

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.979
are you going to do with all the canned

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.570
goods if this turns out to just be

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.010
the flu are you gonna eat those sardines

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.830
no it's not the flu it's not the flu

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.040
okay dr. Tom Green are you sure it's not

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:42.870
the flu I think it's important to convey

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.430
that to to our friends and followers and

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.500
fans on social media because at the end

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.750
of the day when this is all over you

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.580
know you want your your fans and

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.400
followers and friends to do well you

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.930
know and we don't want them to get sick

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.750
and so so there's some things I'm trying

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.480
to not kind of joke around about you

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.070
know because I actually do really I'm

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.500
really kind of feeling worried about

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.980
everybody in in this country in Canada

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.810
and around the world right now so yeah

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.950
but not to bring the mood down you're

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.260
not trying to bring the mood down but

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.880
you know sometimes I think if you sort

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.970
of base these conversations on a

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.730
foundation of seriousness it actually

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.270
kind of raises the level of of you know

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.720
of you know attention that people might

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.740
be given to what we're talking about

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.860
here so back to the sardines but no no I

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.020
agree I agree and it's I was I was

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.550
telling that yesterday like I'm usually

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.000
like III wake up scared of it and then

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.130
I'm scared all day and they all start

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.690
and then I'll start drinking and I'm

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.850
like f [ __ ] it I'm untouchable

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.550
yeah yeah and I wake up in the morning

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.220
hungover like I did today and I read

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.070
about how you have to like lay on your

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.160
stomach for a week at a time so to not

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.430
lay on your your lungs and they just

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.190
pump oxygen into you yeah for weeks

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.240
until you either die or get better yeah

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.970
we're gonna run out of beds yeah not

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.370
only is that horrible but like even if

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.380
you don't really get those kind of

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.120
symptoms yourself you know the older

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.150
people and people that are compromised

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.010
you know we want to be spreading that

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.169
around so I'm actually looking at it as

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.680
a sort of a I mean if I'm going to put

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.430
any sort of lay

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.320
of optimism on it I'm looking at it as

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.600
kind of a strange sort of unfortunate

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.980
opportunity to be able to just stay home

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.680
and play in my computer all day you know

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.950
what do you got longer comp well yeah

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.230
I've got I do a lot of I make hip hop

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.640
beats basically right I make dope dope

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.340
hip hop beats and and I've been

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.200
recording my podcast as well so I

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.380
launched a podcast I relaunched my

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.170
podcast last week and I'm doing one

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.100
every day and I'm taking calls and

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.950
talking about the pandemic that we're

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.260
going through right now so it's weird

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.400
don't you guys you guys find that that

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.340
it's sort of like you kind of can't

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.930
believe that it's happening a little bit

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.110
Oh totally like yeah I mean we we know

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.180
what's happening but then you can't

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.210
believe it I think it's like depending

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.190
on how much you really believe that it's

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.940
going to be you know Stephen King's The

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.370
Stand basically have you seen that movie

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.190
or read the book I read a book yeah yeah

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.090
where everybody basically in its it sort

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.710
of feels a bit like that to me like I

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.810
think that in my head takes me to this

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.150
place where I'm prepared for that like I

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.190
have I have enough food here probably to

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.620
last me I have enough food to last me

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.310
for a month

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.690
but I got I sort of get nervous and

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.970
realizing that's not a gonna be enough

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.370
to get through this so I ordered this 10

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.490
pound bag of rice on Amazon so I could

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.140
probably last a year if you know if you

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.260
have rice beans and corn that is a

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.040
completely balanced diet you can live

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.320
off that alone so I mean I'm gonna try

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.680
to get about a year's supply of food I'm

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.410
gonna put in back in the garage just in

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.240
case this thing really drags on but the

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.260
thing that's interesting

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.650
Shane this rules by the way I'm so happy

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.690
I was like what the [ __ ] are we gonna

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.760

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.290
head I was I was eating Cheerios this

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.580

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.810
frake Fred actually

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.320
left a comment on one of my posts that I

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.010
made on my Instagram last night about a

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:06.240
hip-hop track that I'm working on oh he

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:14.790
said butter which is cool but no because

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.310
I've never no it's okay the thing is I

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.930
because I've never really ordered off

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.700
Instagram before and now I'm starting to

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.670
get these packages or starting to arrive

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.700
it's exciting it's not like it's kind of

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.650
like I'm waiting for Christmas every day

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.740
are you worried they're contaminated I

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.610
am I don't so this is the process all

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.890
right no I am oh and that's very real

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:42.890
thing by the way for like 48 hours yeah

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:50.610
but then you can never use it I didn't

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.350
have enough cleansers so I didn't have

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.250
enough Clorox and and rubber gloves and

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.720
all the things that you need to be can't

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.850
be contaminated stuff so then I get in

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.070
sort of a catch-22 situation because

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.650
I've ordered the rubber gloves but I

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.630
don't have rubber gloves so how do I get

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.670
the rubber gloves out of the rubber

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.170
glove packaging without the rubber

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.670
gloves you see you see what happened

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.120
yeah so I I just sort of basically

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.760
picked it up with some like tongs and I

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.140
put it in the garage and it's just

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.780
sitting in the garage for for for a few

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.600
days until I can get access to the the

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.400
cleansers that I got I've got a little

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.170
cleanser left so got a little bit of

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.760
cleanser left yes you are a hundred

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.170
percent gonna survive yeah by the way I

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.130
don't you guys are my friends and you

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.370

product yeah this right here no no it's

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:56.550
not just because it's my name but it's

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.820
because and this is not an official

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.830
endorsement or anything like that but

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.620
this [ __ ] man is the stuff that kills

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.790
the virus this does more so than Lysol

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.670
that is the best stuff I really know

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.709
just take a shot of that if they don't

00:11:13.709 --> 00:11:19.320
feel good you know my friend drank it

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.769
one time like if you feel really really

00:11:22.769 --> 00:11:30.620
really bad yeah damn dude but you know

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:36.180
no I'm cleaning the pack tree and and

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.889
then I'm letting it sit for two days and

00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:39.630
then I'm getting into it unfortunately I

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.740
don't need anything right now the

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.660
supplies that I have coming right now or

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.480
essentially restock for a month from now

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.370
when I start to running a running out of

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.000
my initial and emergency supplies so but

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.100
I don't I think maybe you got this

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.560
dialed in the right way Shane I think

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.350
just sitting down in North Carolina or

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.820
South Carolina and drinking on the beach

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.110
I think that's probably a better way to

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.579
go than all that's [ __ ] I'm yeah I

00:12:02.579 --> 00:12:05.399
mean I don't know we'll see I mean

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:06.449
either way I'm definitely taking

00:12:06.449 --> 00:12:08.279
precautions and it's funny how much it

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:11.610
like definitely is in my head like I

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.230
have like for some reason I've been

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:22.860

number four in the totem pole of

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:40.260
diseases right now we're good though

tossing tossing granola bars into her

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:49.410
and though we all we all have it so

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.750

a hot bath and got myself up to a

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.930
hundred degrees and definitely killed

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:24.419
hairdryer up your nose and it's over go

00:13:24.419 --> 00:13:31.919
back to Taiwan this and take a sip of

00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:33.359
water every 15 minutes and you'll wash

00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:34.769
it down to your stomach where the

00:13:34.769 --> 00:13:37.289
stomach will destroy it I heard that too

00:13:37.289 --> 00:13:40.350
I honestly heard that I would think

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.089
Bushmills would do a better job really

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:44.220
you take that I think take us a yeah

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.029

00:13:47.029 --> 00:13:50.819
shot in terms of put on the hand combat

00:13:50.819 --> 00:13:54.869
what are you prepared to do you know I I

00:13:54.869 --> 00:13:58.229
okay I'll talk I'll tell you what I

00:13:58.229 --> 00:14:01.229
usually do in that situation I'm a very

00:14:01.229 --> 00:14:02.720
fast runner

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.269
so I usually run in the opposite

00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:08.039
direction of anything like that and

00:14:08.039 --> 00:14:10.249
that's pretty much the the intention

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:12.179
don't I sardines

00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:14.970
I run well someone's coming in saying

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.149
Tom where the [ __ ] of the sardines it

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:19.769
you got to underground like into a

00:14:19.769 --> 00:14:36.569
corner you're back into a corner I'd say

00:14:36.569 --> 00:14:40.529
I have a healthy supply of food in the

00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:42.539
trunk of my car as well so I'm ready to

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:46.559
just geez dude I'm ready to jet and you

00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:51.659
know so III advise this anybody who is

00:14:51.659 --> 00:14:55.979
you know concerned about burglaries or

00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:57.329
any of this sort of thing you know I

00:14:57.329 --> 00:14:59.179
grew up in Canada right so in Canada

00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:04.229
it's a there's not as much as far as you

00:15:04.229 --> 00:15:05.729
know guns and stuff like that up in

00:15:05.729 --> 00:15:08.369
Canada so I find down here in the US

00:15:08.369 --> 00:15:10.669
like people are so ready to confront

00:15:10.669 --> 00:15:14.039
like danger like if they say yeah oh

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:16.229
yeah you know like you go to a gun store

00:15:16.229 --> 00:15:18.539
and they say you know oh you know you

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:21.419
want a shotgun you know because you know

00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:23.369
if someone breaks into the house all you

00:15:23.369 --> 00:15:27.359
need to do is they hear that through the

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:29.669
door and then they go running you know

00:15:29.669 --> 00:15:31.019
and so it's like this idea of

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:32.879
confrontation you know like in Canada

00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:34.180
what do you do on

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.339
just like a beat it bud

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:47.529
yeah pretty much

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:51.339
and also the well the person in Canada

00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:53.080
the person breaking into your house

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.570
doesn't have a gun so then you just you

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.790
know it's a little bit of a different

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.910
kind of equation but here well tell that

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:05.200
to OJ's wife yeah yeah yeah it still can

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.450
be a negative experience ya know for

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:07.870
sure

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.540
III go back to what I sort of started

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:16.300
with don't retreat retreat yeah I run so

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.190
I always like to I always like to say

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.910
have two exits from the place that

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.950
you're sleeping to two doors so if

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.899
you're asleep in your bedroom you should

00:16:25.899 --> 00:16:29.320
have a door of course you need a door to

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.510
get in first of all a door to the house

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.339
to the main house and then if you are on

00:16:33.339 --> 00:16:35.830
the ground floor a door that goes to the

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.720
outside if you're on an upstairs floor

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.640
the door to the outside to the balcony

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.040
or the window have a rope ladder so you

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.370
can get out the other way so be here

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.320
commotion and if you hear somebody in

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.910
your house the the response is not hey

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.709

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.730

gunfight I'm sorry like yeah that's

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:13.689
now my now my jaw is hanging yeah like

00:17:13.689 --> 00:17:15.640
the dish the dishwasher turning on at

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.500
night and Tom hit the [ __ ] rope ladder

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:27.970
what about traps I have a lot of things

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.400
though in place here that I don't really

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.080
want to go into detail on so you're

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.360

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:46.240
Legos by the windows I'll tell you on

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.100
another subject

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.420
you know I love I live here sort of Los

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:57.750
Angeles so I've been seeing a increased

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:02.080
military activity in the last three days

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.500
and occasionally I'll see a military

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:11.830
helicopter fly by but not regularly in

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.750
the last three days

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.750
and increasing yesterday I've seen I'm

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.400
seeing Black Hawk helicopters flying by

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.410
I'm seeing Ospreys you know those

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.720
Ospreys the big with the big I'm seeing

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.450
them fly by all day every day they're

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:28.180
buzzing my house and it's definitely a

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.740
show of force they're definitely out

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.420

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.660
hardware to the citizens of this fine

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.110
city and I'm kind of thinking that that

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.340
does indicate to me that that people are

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.450

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.480

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:57.580
for the worst and it's scary it's pretty

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.060

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.420
experience on this planet you know you

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.190
know that like Scarface just with a face

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:22.480
full of sardines hey you know what I

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.990
wanted to say of course you know I don't

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.990
want to bury the lead here but man one

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:32.230
of the the big bummer is about this

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.200
whole thing is the stank face I know man

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.480
skank fest got cancelled or rescheduled

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.430
I mean I was so looking forward to come

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.500
to skank fest and hanging out with you

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.500
god damn I mean we've been talking about

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.960
this and since I met you in New York

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.630
City you know and then you were nice

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.970
enough to invite me to that you know we

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.200
had a good time in New York though you

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.210
know it was fun and then well you're

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.980
such a [ __ ] great hanging it's it's

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.450
crazy because a lot of these dudes like

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.610
you that are like you know celebrities

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.830
bit like you can be real [ __ ] but

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:09.480
you're the [ __ ] up man yeah they stink

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:15.640
they do suck it's crazy I don't know why

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.870
people get like that but I think people

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.550
sometimes not everybody's like that

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.470
though I think it's just there are a lot

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.360
of people like that in general but but

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.660
III I'm glad that you don't think I'm

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:36.250
you know that I'm a [ __ ] as you put it

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.480
but yeah cuz like yeah that was gonna be

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.980
fun I mean I was really looking forward

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.650
just hanging with you guys and are they

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.690
gonna reschedule it or yeah it I did

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.570
well see they very optimistically

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.570
rescheduled it for September I know

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:56.070
you're not gonna be there Tobias you

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.630
well let's see how this goes I mean I

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:03.120
really hope that uh that that you know

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.020
September I could be wrong about that

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.820
but it's also like they were almost

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.740
Lewis was like almost adamant about

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.110
trying to keep it going in like right

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.820
when he said like unless the city shuts

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.200
it down I'm still doing it right after

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.340
South by Southwest

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.160
and I was talking on like bro you might

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.790
want to cancel this thing yeah yeah this

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.290
is a bad idea right now

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.630
yeah I mean I can imagine it must have

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.070
been kind of a tough decision because

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.140
it's one of those things where at first

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.990
you know you nobody really knew yeah how

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.810
bad it was gonna be and you're kind of

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.220
every day you're thinking okay

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.680
undeniable at some point but but yeah I

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.020
mean I'm definitely there as soon as as

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.030
soon as you schedule it as long as as

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.920
long as this pandemics you know died

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.990
down I'm sure I'm sure they won't be

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.910
able to do it until it's safe anyway so

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.020
so will did you last time I saw you you

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.460
had a beard did you shave your beard

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:02.050
because of the pandemic I haven't shaved

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.580
my beard probably like 10 years and the

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.980
last time I shaved it I shaved it and

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.950
then I immediately began growing it back

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.080
every once in a while like every decade

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.480
or so I like to just shave it you know

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.160
kind of air out or whatever I think once

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.380
every two years but but you know yeah it

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.540
wasn't just because I believe that it's

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.330
a you know a place that viruses can live

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.410
because I don't really think that's

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:31.420
necessarily the case it's just more like

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.030
I'm here I'm home alone I was suffering

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:37.060
from extreme boredom this is what's

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.580
weird about this okay so you know I'm

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.310
not married I don't have kids

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.960
I'm currently you know between

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.150
relationships meaning I'm not in one I'm

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.950
assuming I'll be in another one one day

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:57.220
so I'm between them but but so I'm kind

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.170
of I'm kind of actually I wasn't

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.530
intending to spend you know three months

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.060
in my house by myself

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:08.620
I was I was I was gonna go up to Canada

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.930
and my family's up there and my parents

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.960
and my brother up there but I thought

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.660
well I'll stay in my house this'll be a

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.970
few weeks and you know do some

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.640
podcasting I'll make some hip hop beats

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.480
and eat sardines but all of a sudden it

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.180
it sort of occurs to me that this is

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.140
going to be

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.570
at three month or so ordeal and and I'm

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.190
here for three months in the house by

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.549
myself and I'm realizing this is this is

00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:39.940
definitely a unique experience that I'm

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.840
about to go through here I'm not going

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.370
I'm not going outside I really am NOT I

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.410
mean I'm going outside and my my deck

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.870
here but I'm not I'm not going to the

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.210
grocery store anymore I'm done with that

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.520
you know the last time I went to the

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.400
grocery store was about eight days ago

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:02.940
and it was sort of my last scary ol

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.520
it was it was like a military operation

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.530
yeah you feel like you my friend said

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:09.700
he's like it feels like you're like deep

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.169
diving in the ocean like we got to get a

00:25:11.169 --> 00:25:13.919
get what we got get the [ __ ] out of here

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:16.960
yeah it's like that grocery store a game

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.570
show or they got it

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:23.309
except you know if you lose you die I

00:25:23.309 --> 00:25:32.500
wore an army jacket i days like this

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:32.950
forever

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:41.650
I did nobody touch each other not quite

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:47.620
you know fully dressed in military garb

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.280
in time you're wrong I'm ready for

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.110
anything I've got Blackhawk helicopters

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:56.500
buzz in the house but when I went to the

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.720
grocery store I had my lifestyle and I

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.950
had some Purell and I went in and I

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:06.490
sprayed the the handle of the the

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.260
grocery cart with a license I'll wash it

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.750
down and then I quickly did what I had

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.700
to do but I'll tell you it was have you

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.559
been to a grocery store well it's not

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:16.210
it's not too crazy where you are right

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.160
now so people are probably living sort

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.770
of business as usual out there right now

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.000
the stomach said they did put out like

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.900
like those Lysol wipes by the carts so

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.429
right when you take a car you just wipe

00:26:27.429 --> 00:26:30.880
it down but that's all yeah for sure are

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.340
all the restaurants closed yeah

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.059
everything closed late they closed like

00:26:36.059 --> 00:26:39.160
three days ago here so everything is

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.800
closed now though okay yeah yeah yeah so

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.030
people know that

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.530
something is happening in South Korea

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.290
and all the toilet paper is gone as well

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.630
yeah in the I've got a theory about that

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:53.800
as well see toilet paper takes up a lot

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.730
of space on the shelf it's big so on the

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.510
witness this initial so people that

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:02.920
why's all the toilet paper a goner

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.870
why are people more concerned about wife

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:06.910
and their ass than eating you know but

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.190
and I realized what it was as soon as

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.930
everybody went to the grocery store at

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.450
once everybody who went to the grocery

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:15.820
store bought one thing a toilet paper in

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:20.040
that first week toilet paper there as

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.840
you would think cuz it's big so you know

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.220
just a normal amount of toilet paper

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.440
takes up an entire aisle so now all of a

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.090
sudden I'll is completely empty there's

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.650
everybody just grab one well a toilet

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.810
paper this is on the first day the

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.390
second day people go there's no toilet

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:37.110
paper they see this long empty show

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.520
visually on the internet that looks

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.100
scary a huge empty shell there's no

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.500
toilet so now everyone says you have to

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.000
get toilet paper you have to get toilet

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.440
paper on the intern you have to get

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.150
toilet paper so now there's a run on

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:50.890
something they're never really had to be

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.200
a run on and now we're never gonna have

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.580
any toilet paper again I don't know I

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.550
don't know for I have I have I have

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.350
enough for for a little while but I do

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.880
need to get some more of that so I don't

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.770
know how I'm gonna do that I don't know

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.090
I'm gonna do what you do every once well

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:05.950
if you can tell it to clean dump just

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.080
hop in the shower time yep right right

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.150
yeah save that toilet paper wipe your

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.030
ass yeah yeah that's true or you could

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.350
actually just just take a [ __ ] in the

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:25.150
shower - are you listen you know I are

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:30.310
you are you feeling any sense of I mean

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:33.250
I'm sure you are I am as stand-ups we

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.220
get up on stage every night yeah it

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:36.790
sucks

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.400
isn't it weird to not be able to get

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.680
that out of your system every night yeah

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.330
that was kind of my entire self-worth

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:50.820
yeah yeah and it's sort of just

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.130
physically and emotionally you get a

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.800
daily biz

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.559
adrenaline rush from it yeah you get an

00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:03.040
emotional catharsis from it and now with

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.570
that absent in our lives

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.600

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.150

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:10.660

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:20.230
drinking and now podcasting podcasting

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.559

00:29:31.179 --> 00:29:36.940
great I today I just posted Andrew Dice

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.870
Clay actually so friend of mine and you

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.410
know dice so he the he's up every day I

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.210
actually today yeah it was yesterday

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.600
today I put one of the founders of the

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.840
Barenaked Ladies Steven page Chris angel

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.710
along this week yeah dr. drew called in

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.780
and we talked about you know medical

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:06.429
medical sort of outlook of this sort of

00:30:06.429 --> 00:30:08.770
a sort of dissected what's going on a

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.590
little bit for me dr. drew made me feel

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.670
better about things but III worry that

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.370
that I still worry that it might not be

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:24.280
as as as easy as he made it sound to me

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.950
so you know I I do want to have dr. drew

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.050
to call back onto the show cuz he's a

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:30.520
friend of mine I kind of want to ask him

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.460
some more he was like wasn't he early on

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.820
kind of like a bit of a he was saying we

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.320
everybody who's being kind of alarmists

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.660
about this yeah I think a lot of people

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.070
have been doing that in the beginning

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.470
and I think we're still in the beginning

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.570
and I think people are starting to

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:52.540
realize that maybe this is worse than

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:56.320
then the flu there's there's definitely

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.510
a strong contingency of people online

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.320
who who debate that and I understand

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.210
that you know you can read anything and

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:05.470
you can believe anything you want and

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:08.500
and people today on the Internet myself

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.390
included

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:13.090
like to question authority and like to

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:17.170
question the rules and it's fun reading

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:20.200
conspiracy theories and hell some of

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.320
them might be true but I look at it like

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.950
this if you're gonna be wrong about

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.920
something don't be wrong about this one

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.890
you can't really yeah yeah yeah you

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.070
decide it's just the flu I'm gonna go

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.140
out and live my arm will life you can't

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.390
take my freedom away I'm gonna do

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.940
whatever the [ __ ] I want and then oops

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.520
I was wrong dead you know I'd rather be

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.170
I'd rather I'd rather be over-prepared

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:52.570
and have you know - too much rice too

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:56.220
many cans of sardines and realize I

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.840
overreacted and then the big the big you

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.340
know downside of that is I've got you

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.680
know I'm eating tuna and out of a can

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.390
for the next you know six years or

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.690
whatever but so so I'm just saying I

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.340
think it's probably better in this one

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.540
just to kind of err on the side of

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.030
caution and just just assume that maybe

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.180
what they're saying is actually right

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.520
yeah suck to be wrong every sucked a big

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.440
[ __ ] that and then die I know well

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.910
that's the thing worth it wasn't worth

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:24.430
it yeah it's like dude if I took this

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.830
thing lightly I would just go I would go

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.210
home to my family

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:34.090
yeah I'm just kill them all yeah in

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:37.090
their 70s they're isolated up at their

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.310
place and I can't no no Tom give me some

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.900
advice here I'm down I'm at the beach

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.420
I'm just renting houses for like weeks

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.850
or two at a time nice but I don't want

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.280
to well it's good I'm just gonna run out

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.710
soon but it's like burning through cash

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:54.040
there huh yeah whatever probably

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.700
probably it's either this would go back

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.500
to [ __ ] my shitty apartment could

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.100
make sure they can't evict you right now

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.500
well that they can bunker damn you do

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.490
you do I mean not to I'm not I'm sort of

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.700
I'm not joking I'm sort of kidding

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.170
around because I don't expect that you

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.300
will take this advice but maybe you

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.390
would do you like camping you like

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:23.320
camping not that much yeah yeah if you

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.250
like

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:27.370
in the woods for a while you know if you

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.200
really like camping you could go get a

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.450
really nice tent you can get for like

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:34.060
the cost of renting a house for one day

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.910
you could probably go get the nicest

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:41.710
most luxurious hipster tent doomsday and

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:45.310
you could go out to you know the Ozarks

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.770
or something and set up this beautiful

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:50.680
tent and have a you know the trunk of

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.630
your car full of supplies you could

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:56.050
probably just kick back there for until

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:59.620
this whole thing's over my god I get a

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.790
cabin in like Montana like a small shed

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:16.030
and start mailing bombs yeah I was

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:20.530
watching the Ted Kaczynski maybe clarify

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.280
that you're just joking yeah yeah or

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.399
maybe I'm telling that pipe bombs elder

00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:29.020
statesman here maybe even just add it

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.570
that part out chain I don't know I would

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:33.340
give Josh about bombs long as you're not

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.310
on an airplane bombs okay I don't know I

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:37.780
don't I get nervous about these sorts of

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:53.080
things you know I'd rather you I mean

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.220
you had helicopters around you I

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.200
wouldn't be running my Yap and I would

00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:01.420
talk just want you to be careful because

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.990
you know during times like this people

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:08.350
people do react strongly to to that kind

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:09.790
of stuff I wouldn't want you guys to get

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:13.510
you know in trouble bomb talk thanks man

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:18.070
yeah no I really am making an effort

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.540
right now and I think we all should

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.790
really look out for our friends you know

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:24.340
I I don't I I'm on the phone all day

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.470
with my friends because I guess I can't

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:28.810
hang out with my friends and have no

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:32.380
social experience other than doing my

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.990
podcast and doing this and calling my

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.360
friends on the phone so I I get on the

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.109
phone I

00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:39.640
I talk to my friends every day for a

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.220
couple hours in the evening and kind of

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.900
talk about serious stuff you know like

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.569
what we're doing to like you said we'll

00:35:46.569 --> 00:35:48.009
make sure that we know how to get our

00:35:48.009 --> 00:35:49.390
stuff into the house without getting

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.420
sick or or make you know there's there's

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.749
a lot of weird little rules to this you

00:35:55.749 --> 00:35:58.809
know the virus can live on cardboard for

00:35:58.809 --> 00:36:01.989
24 hours plastic for two days and

00:36:01.989 --> 00:36:03.489
stainless steel for three days

00:36:03.489 --> 00:36:06.640
supposedly but then I hear then I hear

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.440
that they just found on one of those

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.559
princess cruise lines they found living

00:36:11.559 --> 00:36:15.099
virus on the boat that has been there

00:36:15.099 --> 00:36:19.809
for 17 days so I don't know if this is

00:36:19.809 --> 00:36:25.749
internet fear-mongering but it's it's

00:36:25.749 --> 00:36:27.970
it's got me nervous I don't really want

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.190
to touch anything so how do you think

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.720
this is gonna fan we have three minutes

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.249
left kazoom what with three people

00:36:33.249 --> 00:36:37.950
unless you upgrade boots you out okay

00:36:39.059 --> 00:36:41.319
here's a question what do you what do

00:36:41.319 --> 00:36:42.279
you how do you think this is gonna

00:36:42.279 --> 00:36:44.259
affect people mentally or what you think

00:36:44.259 --> 00:36:45.549
is gonna make people change things about

00:36:45.549 --> 00:36:46.809
themselves after this is all said and

00:36:46.809 --> 00:36:49.509
done yeah I guess an optimistic outlook

00:36:49.509 --> 00:36:51.700
would be and what I really hope happens

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.579
is I actually think that I mean I do

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:56.380
think some good good could come from

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.059
this I really do think some good could

00:36:58.059 --> 00:37:00.849
come from this you know we're all locked

00:37:00.849 --> 00:37:03.099
in her homes and thinking about I think

00:37:03.099 --> 00:37:04.059
people gonna think about the world

00:37:04.059 --> 00:37:06.549
differently first of all you know like

00:37:06.549 --> 00:37:10.239
like this virus was in China a few weeks

00:37:10.239 --> 00:37:13.299
ago and now it's here that that really

00:37:13.299 --> 00:37:15.789
makes the world seem like a smaller

00:37:15.789 --> 00:37:18.130
place the people that aren't used to

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:20.140
traveling around the world I mean I know

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.079
with my touring I've been to China I was

00:37:23.079 --> 00:37:24.759
in China you know a year ago doing

00:37:24.759 --> 00:37:26.559
stand-up it's been more than 14 days but

00:37:26.559 --> 00:37:29.140
since it was everybody so I know you can

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.359
get if you get on a plane in the morning

00:37:31.359 --> 00:37:34.539
and be eating lunch in Shanghai the next

00:37:34.539 --> 00:37:36.519
day a lot of people I don't think like

00:37:36.519 --> 00:37:38.309
that so I don't think they think about

00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:42.789
pollution or the way we think about the

00:37:42.789 --> 00:37:45.099
health care system it's it's everything

00:37:45.099 --> 00:37:47.259
is connected you drive past homeless

00:37:47.259 --> 00:37:49.690
people and you see them living in tents

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:51.339
on the street you think well I don't

00:37:51.339 --> 00:37:52.059
need to worry about

00:37:52.059 --> 00:37:54.699
then but now maybe people might start to

00:37:54.699 --> 00:37:55.989
think we should worry about them we

00:37:55.989 --> 00:37:58.029
should look after everybody because they

00:37:58.029 --> 00:38:00.670
get sick I'm gonna get sick everyone's

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.380
gonna get sick let's have a healthy

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.509
society let's look after our our

00:38:04.509 --> 00:38:09.339
environment and let's and let's talk to

00:38:09.339 --> 00:38:10.569
each other more and look out for each

00:38:10.569 --> 00:38:12.009
other more so hopefully that'll be a

00:38:12.009 --> 00:38:14.349
positive result oh yeah man thanks
