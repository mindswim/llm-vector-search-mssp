i'm

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.520
yeah i was reading something recently

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.920
about like what monks what a monk was

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.680
saying like five things you should do in

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.519
life for and one of them was as soon as

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.119
you wake up you should

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.200
like meditate on death

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.960
yeah hell yeah yeah

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.960
that's that's yeah that's probably how

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.640
i'm going to start my days now yeah oh

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.600
yeah

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.880
you have to always be thinking about

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.119
that yeah god that's the most gangster

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.560
[ __ ] i think i've ever heard in my life

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.080
yeah just wake up every morning and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.320
think about death yeah

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.390
the other ones are like drink water

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.479
[Laughter]

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.240
no he's right that's that's that's the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.680
right call everyone should be thinking

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.439
about that as much as possible

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.920
like do you do you think about death

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.079
like what have you uh

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.600
like what conclusions about it what

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.399
makes you comfortable with it i guess

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.159
uh

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.479
fact that i'm healthy right now

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.399
i'm healthy

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.479
uh you're like that's way down the line

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.680
yeah yeah

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.600
no i just you know

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.720
the thing that makes me the most

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.079
comfortable with it is thinking about

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.360
how

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.520
you know we're essentially just like

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.360
cosmic energy and we just

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.280
go back into that so it's like you shed

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.799
your person you know you shed your

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.799
personality that falls away and that's

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.239
that's tough to grieve but you're like

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.920
yeah i still have infinite energy that's

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.280
pretty sick yeah we're going to get in

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.480
light in this episode it's going to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.000
happen it's just going to be our last

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.319
episode of two days it might just stop

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.840
figure it out yeah that's i think about

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.000
that a lot crazy yeah that's you know

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.840
yeah i uh i mostly fear

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.840
freak accidents yes

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.360
that's my biggest like i'm a big

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.040
build-up i do i'm kind of a prima donna

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.120
about how i die i i i agree with you

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.360
yeah i'm i'm very i'm i'm concerned that

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.400
it's gonna be

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.920
like

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.400
yeah you know well i mean not concerned

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.400
in that uh

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.879
you know like i guess more like i i will

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.280
never have my affairs in order

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.160
enough to just go instantly

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.879
true that's a good point and yeah i just

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.560
i just want like the build-up i want

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.080
like to like did you ever see the movie

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.200
stepmom

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.879

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.400
to the point where like i don't want to

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.879
live anymore it hurts yeah just like a

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.720
[ __ ] like somebody's hot air balloon

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.720
just dislodges and the basket falls on

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.040
me out back just like it's a weird freak

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.799
accident that would be kind of nice yeah

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.720
i'd be pretty sick just to throw people

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.200
off yeah because it would it would for a

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.200
split second you'd find out like you

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.959
don't hear how sydney died like a hot

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.760
air balloon basket fell on top of

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.760

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.840
me be like did he try to catch it

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.120

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.280
little bit of mystery true about like

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.040
what like how did i get into that

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.040
situation where that happened yeah or to

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.280
pay somebody to disappear your body

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.360
like you have like a you know a couple

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.799
months ago and you just don't tell

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.599
the [ __ ]

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.920
i think you're getting ascension rumors

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.360
if you're like if you vanish as like say

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.720

dude you just disappeared dude that

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.880
might be the best way to guarantee that

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.120
ansley never finds another love after i

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.840
go

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.360
that's a good point too yeah that's a

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.280
good point around here somewhere yeah

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.720
either you'll think that or you'll

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.479
dedicate the rest of your life to

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.080
finding out what happened to me yeah but

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.360

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.800
i think i pig out on higher

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.639
consciousness stuff so what do you think

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.280
about the the possibility of of

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.199
achieving it like what do you do you

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.080
think our quest is noble to be to not

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.160
have to change our inappropriate sense

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.000
of humor and

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.319
still achieve a higher consciousness

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.759
yeah i mean i don't think you can

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.520
achieve higher consciousness without

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.639
letting go of what you deem

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.080
inappropriate especially in the realm of

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.120
humor

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.479
so if you're judging people what people

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:57.919
are laughing at you're probably i mean

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.080
you ever see the scale of consciousness

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.560
it goes from zero to a thousand what

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.280
yeah humanity's sat in like

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.280
anything under 200 is not life-affirming

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.440
and humanity as a whole has been in like

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.680
180 for a long time we're now at two

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.080
we're now collectively around like 2

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.759
20 something how do what do they rank

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:16.720
this on

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.319
uh how do you this is a good question

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.080
this is it's this is kind of a sore spot

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.479
a guy determines by doing uh applied

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:24.240
kinesiology which which is muscle

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.160
testing so you hold your elbow you hold

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.520
your arm out and if you're if you're

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.400
like

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.400
uh encountering a falsehood your elbow

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.000
will dip a little bit but if it's true

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
it's favorite game right now

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.720
of each other's line

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.720
so he used that and he did this whole

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.840
scale and he would just like test

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.560
certain things like is it over 300

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.720
and you know

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.400
your armors go down

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.639
this guy wrote like thousands of pages

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.160
the books are fantastic it's just the

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.199
method is highly controversial

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:55.520
it sounds like he started out like he he

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.080
got his measurement system using someone

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.360
like me because like any other scale is

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.199
like you know one to ten

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:06.720
you know something that you can quantify

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.879
i don't know a thousand

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.800
i think i'm a thousand the coolest thing

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.000
about the test i've read a lot of this

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.280
guy's books the coolest thing about the

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.039
test is people would use it and they're

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:17.199
like i'm not this is [ __ ] and he was

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:19.680
like well it turns out if you're below

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.599
200 on the conscious scale it won't work

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:21.860
for you

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.039
[Laughter]

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:26.800
so it's kind of like yeah

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.879
it's built in to like determine if

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:30.639
people have like um

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:32.240
they like bad intentions the tests won't

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.159
work for them yeah yeah i mean how

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.839
awesome is it though that you have a

00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:38.240
thing going on that it's set up so that

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.080
when somebody's like this is [ __ ]

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.760
you're like i'm so sorry to hear that

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.320
it's not looking good for you buddy dude

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.080
the other stuff this guy writes is it's

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.240
fantastic he writes specifically about

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.680
how to because when you go up to a

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.519
thousand that's that's enlightenment

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:56.000
yeah you know but anything over 200 is

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.800
good

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.279
okay where is he at is he a thousand uh

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.279
i he never really discussed his own

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:03.839
score but yeah the last book i listen to

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:05.519
him is just question and answer and he's

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.519
just rattling off answers to questions

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:09.279
and i'm like this guy's he's up there

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:10.800
yeah yeah

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.279
he's out there all right so

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:15.120
his name is david hawkins i think david

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.720
hawkins we'll check him out yeah pretty

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.800
good it's pretty good actually you gave

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.760
me

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.560
uh

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.720
i've been you gave me some reading

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.959
that he his original study i think it

00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:27.440
was and you told me like to skip the

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.519
like deep chapters

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:31.120
yes that was yeah power verse force

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.880
power was worse yeah skip to the the

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.800
whole first half of every of one of his

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.480
books he talks about applied kinesiology

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.440
and it's like

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.360
it goes into like serious detail and

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.959
it's like dude please talk about outer

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:41.839
space

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:44.160
explain outer space please explain god

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.320
to me i don't i get it it's cool yeah

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.040
yeah i love dude his books are fantastic

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.320
just having the scale of consciousness

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.320
is cool too yeah it's pretty cool that

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.120
is it's just just having something to be

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.360
able to look at a person be like

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.360
400

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.519
400 400 400 is the area of the intellect

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:02.959
that's like really smart people who

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:04.560
haven't got out of linear thinking but

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.240
are like the height of linear thinking

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.040
man that is uh now i want to of course

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.800
take back that exaggeration of 400

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.720
because one of my

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.800
one of my biggest pet peeves

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.360
is a person that you know is a [ __ ]

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.680
idiot trying to declare that someone

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.519
else is a genius

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.480
yeah

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.560
do i hate being oh this person's a

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.480
genius like how would you know what a

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.640
jesus is

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.880
no way yeah no way you can determine

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.560
what a genius is yeah you know that's a

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.640
fair i guess who yeah who can reliably

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.040
do that i can't i don't feel comfortable

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.279
saying that what i can what i can say

00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:41.279
for sure is like that person is really

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:43.600
good at that yeah like that's all i can

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.360
really say for sure or it's like that

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.519
person seems smarter than me yeah like

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:49.440
once you're like i don't know i don't

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.200
know what the difference is between

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.680
smarter than me and a genius

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.000
i think the literal term of a genius is

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.760
somebody who's like

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.279
possessed

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:01.360
by the thing they're doing to the point

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.720
where you feel like it almost comes

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.120
outside from outside of them the genius

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.720
was like it comes from like the daemon

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.480
thing from it like your demon from

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.800
ancient greece genius somehow is linked

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.399
to that like somebody who's in complete

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:14.160
possession of their daemons yeah and

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.200
just

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.320
you know

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.000
in different areas so you could be like

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.640
a genius douchebag yes like if all you

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.399
cared about was like getting [ __ ] oh

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:24.160
yeah you could no

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:24.900
literally

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.959
[Laughter]

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:28.959
so so i guess i take it back so like

00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:30.880
when you say somebody when they're like

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.920
the baby is a genius like yeah yes he is

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.760
yeah kind of yeah you know it's like

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.040
he's about getting [ __ ] and money like

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.200
that's all he seems to be about yeah he

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.680
lives that he exudes that

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.279
genius what's also too i think it's

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:44.720
something that they phrase it as it's

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.920
something people possess like you

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.920
possess genius and it just means like

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.800
single-minded focus in one area where

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.160
almost you're compelled against your

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.240
will yeah

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.680
that's interesting

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.279
i mean i i guess that's an interesting

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:59.760
way to look at

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.639
that

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:02.959
when because you can easily any anybody

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:04.880
can identify like that person seems to

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.160
be possessed

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.920
you know yeah i feel like it's easy to

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.000
see when you think about like musicians

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.519
and artists that way because like you

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:12.880
see how much

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.200
musicians live lives that are like

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.920
detrimental to them yeah and you're like

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.160
you know like why can't they stop like

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.480
destroying themselves you know

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.000
yeah so damon dude yeah

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.440
i guess it always annoyed me when they

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.800
would say somebody like like pamela

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.639
anderson's a genius

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:31.760
like really

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.440
yeah why is she

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.279
who was the who was the the one chick

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:37.279
kardashian was getting genius yeah yeah

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:40.480
yeah it's like she's married to kanye so

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.600
is is he a genius

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.360
i used to hate when people said that now

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.959
i'm kind of like yeah yeah you think

00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:48.560
it's a genius i think so yeah i was

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.760
thinking about something funny the other

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.639
day where if um if kanye runs for

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:55.360
president again yeah i'm gonna run for

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.959
kanye

00:12:56.959 --> 00:13:00.079
okay yeah because like kanye like the

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:02.880
what is kanye west has

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.760
uh transcended the human that is kanye

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.079
like it's a mantle now like somebody has

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.320
to be that like you can't you can't be

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.639
kanye and president yeah yeah they're

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:15.200
dialectically true yeah right but

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.200
somebody has to be kind there has to be

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.480
a kanji he becomes a pr it would be

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.600
funny if he became the president was

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.260
just like talk like mike pence

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.000
[Laughter]

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.279

pissed at him yeah there's a story he

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.880
fired one of his sound engineers and he

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.639

i was trying to catch up on the matrixes

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.079
because the new matrix

00:14:58.959 --> 00:15:01.040

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.279
matt what we're gonna do uh on the show

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:04.959
and we hope this is gonna be

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:06.480
kind of uh

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.880
the rubric for how all of our guests are

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.440
gonna go so we're basically gonna go

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.160
through the process of uh

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.000
opening up the chakras i guess we're

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.839
gonna we're gonna go through if you've

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:18.880
seen

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.279
avatar the last airbender the guru

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:23.199
episode yeah that's basically what our

00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:25.519
show is that's awesome yeah that was one

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:27.040
of the best episodes by the way it is

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.720
and we never get past the second shot

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.480
right here like we really i mean because

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.560
we we always get sidetracked we we

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.560
usually don't even start until i mean

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.560
we're we're starting way early yeah like

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.959
we're usually bullshitting

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:41.600
yeah and uh so i'm really excited about

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.720
this i'm excited about like to go

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.560
through this whole entire process and

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.480
then become enlightened through your

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.399
experience nice right because that's

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:49.600
that's what we're trying to do because

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.680
if anybody can figure it out we'll all

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.560
know it true right that is a fact so

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.480
before we uh before we even get into

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.279
this

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:59.519
one of the questions that i have is uh

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:01.440
like what situation or experience in

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.480
your life do you feel like you got the

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.120
most information from

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.240
uh

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.519
being divorced

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:08.959
oh yeah yeah

00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:10.079
yeah

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:12.800
just that that was like

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.120
um

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.360
that was when i was like all right

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.120
because i was just [ __ ] off like in

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.959
every dimension of my life i was like

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:22.880
whatever whatever and then you go

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.720
through that you're like oh my god the

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.639
repercussions to stuff are so [ __ ]

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.480
real

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.360
you can't say whatever to things

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.440
yeah easily i would say hands down yeah

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.480
like what were some of the immediate

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.920
repercussions that like brought you out

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.120
of your your peter pan lifestyle

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.160
uh

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.360
were you peter pan and is that what

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.440
you're you yeah i would say just just

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.600
like not having any [ __ ] idea what

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.079
excuse me yeah

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:49.519
okay i mean you don't have to for this i

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:51.519
know but yeah what is also funny to me

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:53.360
to be like

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.759
the uh

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.800
yeah

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.320
the answer the first i kind of forget

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.000
your first question you're saying it was

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.680
like uh

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.600
yeah it definitely made it

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.039
it wasn't even peter pan it was like i

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:09.919
had just i had no idea what the [ __ ] i

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:11.919
was doing so then like

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:13.039
you know when you like break up when

00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:14.400
you're younger it's like i was still in

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.160
that mode of high school being like oh

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.760
man i'm bringing up my girlfriend and

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.199
it's like just be like oh my god i can't

00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:20.880
believe she's crying like just like

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.280
being a [ __ ] yeah and then yeah you get

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.600
to an age where like you see like

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.919
devastation in terms of a relationship

00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:29.280
and it's like

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.640
what the [ __ ]

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.160
i need to be more conscious how i live

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.919
my life this this can go

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.679
very badly

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.679
so i mean so so

00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:39.200
what do you remember like the first

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.039
thing you felt like you needed to like

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:42.080
because every now and again like you hit

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.520
a rock bottom you're like i need to

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.960
change this

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.720
you know yeah it wasn't there yet i was

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.320
just like this is [ __ ] but i'm the

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.080
best

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.600
i was still like

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.720
i'm the best this is sad and [ __ ] up

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.400
but i'm gonna go be the best and then

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.080
you know i always i've talked about this

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.840
before how it's like especially when

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.440
you're in like a long-term relationship

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.440
like that the picture you build of

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.440
yourself as a single person is just

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.520
completely a fantasy story i remember

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.600
just being like dude if i were single

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.919
and you you get out of it you go

00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:14.080
oh i remember this i was kind of like

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.480
angst like angsty and like weird and i

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.960
didn't talk to anybody and i was like i

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.919
don't think i'm gonna get out here and

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:21.280
crush it like i thought it you know it's

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.640
just it's just funny to come to grips

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.919
with that like oh i remember this yeah

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:25.679
yeah because you did you start blaming

00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:27.039
like when you're in the relationship

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:29.039
like blaming things on her like yeah it

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:31.039
would be so much better like all this

00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:32.799
baggage yes

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:34.400
yeah that's that's a tough way to put it

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.080
but yes

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.679
no you start to build this fantasy of

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:39.280
like because i didn't have any like i

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.799
didn't know how to cook before now to do

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:42.240
anything yeah i'm like i know how to

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.039
cook now i should just be single

00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:46.080
if i knew how to do that this would be

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.799
crazy yeah i i have not

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:49.919
dated

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:51.200
from

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.000
my

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.720
20s yeah like so we'll say i mean our

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.320
relationship wasn't all peachy in the

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.640
beginning yeah so we'll say something a

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.919
little bit during their life yeah yeah

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.240
a few few days while we were together

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.679
but

00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:07.280
from my mid-20s

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.640
until

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.919
now so for like 15 16 years i've been

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:14.400
completely out of the dating pool and

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.840
not only that everything changed it went

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.400
from analog to digital in the time that

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.799
we've been together oh yeah yeah so the

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:22.400

god forbid i had to be single again i

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.559
couldn't imagine

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:24.559
i think i would just

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:26.640
like monk out and just be done with it

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.880
all yeah dating in adulthood is like

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.480
selling drugs in adulthood it's like the

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.679
same thing it's like when you're younger

00:20:31.679 --> 00:20:33.280
it's like yeah okay like when you do it

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.760
into your like 40s and 50s it's kind of

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.400
like oh [ __ ] yeah it's shitty i [ __ ]

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.400
up my life clientele the clientele

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.159
switches up everybody tells us

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.520
all right so we're cooking we're cooking

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.200
we're cooking we're cooking hopefully

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.159
that was the first thing that popped in

00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:56.080
my mind yeah no no i mean that's that's

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.840
that's preferably

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.760
how we would want you to answer you know

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.799
like what's what's the first thing that

00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:02.159
comes your name is i didn't see people

00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:03.760
as three-dimensional creatures until

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.000
then i was just kind of like cool cool

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.600
cool and you're like oh jesus christ

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.760
it's horrible yeah

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.880
so

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.559
how would you say

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:16.679
you learned to overcome fear

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.640
um

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.760
the

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.200
most recent well

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.400
so there's the most recent thing was

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.240
doing the five grams of mushrooms

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.080
because i was kind of like

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.000
i've had like really bad anxiety like

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.280
when i was younger

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.919
and i'd always was like you know i had

00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:33.360
when i did the mushrooms i was nervous

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.559
to do that much i was like what's going

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:35.840
to happen what if it goes wrong and i

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.520
was like i just want to

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.360
do the thing that's really to answer

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.400
your question you have to do the thing

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.799
you're afraid of yeah you have to

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:44.240
it's like you know unless it's like

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.840
something like crazy like you know i

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.120
wouldn't like jump off your roof like

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.240
that would be a bad thing but like if

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.520
it's like i always wanted to know what

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.640
it was like to take a man's life

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.799
within reason yeah whatever reason i've

00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:56.360
been so scared but matt said

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.280
[Laughter]

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.320
there's like things you don't that make

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.520
you kind of uncomfortable that keep

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.120
coming up you have to you have to face

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.640
them yeah otherwise your life just keeps

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.280
shrinking the thing for like

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.679
fear like panic or anxiety this is from

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:11.200
david hawkins who did the consciousness

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.679
scale is you focus

00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:15.440
on the physical sensation of fear so you

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.120
disengage from thinking right there's a

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.559
whole thought process that just keeps

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:20.640
triggering fearful sensations

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.159
you disengage from the thought process

00:22:22.159 --> 00:22:23.520
say all right i'm going to focus on the

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.919
physical sensations of fear and you boil

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:27.120
them down to like you know what do i

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.720
have like a tight chest my stomach feels

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.640
weird i'm breathing you kind of attack

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.159
it like you would a sprained ankle where

00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:34.240
you're like can i take the physical

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.000
feeling of fear can i handle this right

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.679
now you say yeah i could you know just a

00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:39.360
physical feeling and then you just let

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.720
go of trying to control or have anything

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.000
to do with it and it kind of just

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.919
mitigates itself

00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:45.440
yeah that's interesting i feel like that

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.600
that's why a lot of these

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.240
uh emotions these emotions that we

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.240
maybe put a pejorative connotation to

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.480
like fear anxiety

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.640
i think when they cause a problem is

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.720
when you're trying to avoid the feeling

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.480
that comes with them without dealing

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.440
with the feel exactly and that

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.360
dissonance i guess i would call it is

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.720
what

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.640
it's why everybody's just you know

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.799
you're it's like all weird

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:12.480
yeah cause you're supposed to like think

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.240
your way out of it but that's the thing

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.320
that's creating it in the first place

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.120
yeah

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.600
all right that was good

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.159
that was the first chakra yeah butthole

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:23.919

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:29.760
the one where we we typically get here

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.039
at the end of the episode and this is

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:33.279
like where we get yeah so

00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:34.559

00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:36.480
uh a segment that we call my bad it's

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.320
our favorite sec yeah and this is what

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.480
you you just basically you send out an

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.360
apology to any person place or thing any

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.400
noun

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.279
that may that throughout the week or

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:48.640
maybe throughout your life that you feel

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.440
like will make your energy even by by

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.640
getting that out

it gets tough very good yeah i think

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.400
that's kind of a

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.039
i'm trying to think what have i

00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:07.520
whom have i been shitty toward i mean

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.520
obviously there's the issue of i haven't

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.640
done this a while but i probably

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.840
apologize for it for stealing from

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.440
self-checkouts okay i think i i should

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.159
just

00:25:16.159 --> 00:25:18.799
squash that just you just like slip one

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:20.880
by into the bag like

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.320
one two five

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.559
whatever's on the bottom of my cart yeah

00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:28.720
i'm really i've been

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.080
no freebies i'm trying to get out of

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.320
that so yeah i would apologize too

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.520
multiple

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.159
large chains

00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:39.679
who do you have to apologize to the most

00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:41.039
i don't want to say

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.400
no yeah

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.919
off the road all of them all of them i

00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:46.640
like just the you know seven major

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.159
corporations out there i'd like to

00:25:48.159 --> 00:25:50.240
apologize to all the uh but don't you

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.240
feel like a little bit like a robin hood

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.400
yeah dude but then it's like

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.240
still you're still stealing dude yeah

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.080
and i'm not giving it to anyone i'm just

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.440
keeping it and eating it i mean but like

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.360
the the robin hood equation works

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.520
because you're you're stealing from a

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.520
major corporate entity that's what i

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.960
always said and it's it's like again i

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.960
don't feel badly like that it's just

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.640
like i don't want to be

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.520
operating on that level just like

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.760
thievery yeah you know it's like i i

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.080

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.240
everything from amazon it makes nice

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.400
good job yeah yeah i just don't want to

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.080
you know i just that's a thing i don't

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.840
want to entangle with

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.760
you know it it is it is weird when you

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.120
go from

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.720
being because you know as you get into

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.039
your older age when you're trying to

00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:40.720
separate yourself from like activities

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.320
like stealing or like starting arguments

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.760
or being a problem

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.039
[ __ ]

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:46.480
it's really you just don't want the

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.360
hassle of the consequences of it

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.000
you know like before the consequences of

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.600
it were exciting

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.960
you know

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:14.080
ah perfect that's that's probably why we

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.320

that everybody's diff it should be

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.760
couples

all right so we're moving up and uh

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.559
disappointment this is about

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:34.640
disappointment like when you think of

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.080
the time you're most disappointed in

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.200
yourself what was it

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.799
um

00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:42.559
most disappointed

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:47.279
tri-weekly cycle of this so every three

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:48.880
weeks i'm like [ __ ]

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.399

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.600
the most disappointed

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.880
i'm trying to think because well i mean

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.039
i i do have to say this too because you

00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:03.039
honestly you you one of the most

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:04.720
impressive work ethics of anybody that

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.000
i've ever seen

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.440
you know like you

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.840
definitely hold yourself accountable for

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.240
getting stuff done and

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.760
at a high level and like you were saying

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.279
you're not late you're very punctual for

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:19.200
i guess for like all of the peter pannis

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.880
that you have you're also very

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.799
responsible and get your [ __ ] done yeah

00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:25.039
you know that was beat into me yeah it's

00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:26.960
pretty sick

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.640
so yeah so that makes me curious even

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.080
more curious like where do you find

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.760
disappointment if i mean you're

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.960
accomplished

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.919
and

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:35.919
uh not necessarily even just accolades

00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:37.679
but just in things that you get done

00:31:37.679 --> 00:31:39.600
like you've

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.760
like over the past couple years you've

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.440
you've finished writing more books that

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.960
i finished reading

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.039
you know really

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:48.960
well it's like once it gets to the very

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.799
very oh it's finished yeah yeah i

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:52.399
[ __ ] know this those last i mail in

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.480
yeah yeah is that i mean i didn't don't

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.320
get me wrong like i do finish even when

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.760
i'm reading the books instead of listen

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.720
i do finish the books but the way i read

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.799
like because i don't i have such reading

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:06.320
like low reading retention i have to

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.080
read every sentence like three or four

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.840
times yeah i saw a guy who talked about

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.120
this who said it's actually it doesn't

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.480
matter if you finish books or not you

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.679
should just read until you're interested

00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:14.880
if you're not interested get another

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.399
book there's so much stuff to learn it's

00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:17.919
like why would you force yourself yeah

00:32:17.919 --> 00:32:19.120
just read it until you don't like it and

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.240
just read something else yeah and it's

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.519
also it's like they're not gripping me

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:23.600
in the end of this book you gotta yeah

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.279
you keep me in this book yeah you think

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:26.559

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:28.080
follow along it's like no especially

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.320
when it's just the the last like 20

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.399
pages is just kind of like a recap of

00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:33.840
everything yeah i hate that it's like

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.760
well i read everything three times

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.799
already just to get here

00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:40.159
yeah

00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:41.200
i'm trying to think the last time i was

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.399
really disappointed um

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:46.640

you ever had any like fatherhood

00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:51.200
disappointment yes i feel like that's

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.120
where i get like yeah like

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.440
if i don't go back into like the oh stu

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.720
like there's something you can go back

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.320
but you're like oh i was a child like i

00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.600

well yeah try weekly cycles yeah

00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:07.039

when i just let myself get like negative

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.480
in the house and i know i'm like if i'm

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.679

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.399
like a pitch black hotel room when she

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:42.399
had come back and maya was there and i

00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:44.480
was just like oh

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.880
[ __ ] i just screamed in agony for like

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.799
two seconds and i was just like oh sorry

00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:50.880
i think i broke it though like

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.279
i was disappointed i let all of it out

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:55.440
in that in that moment and like

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.279
cursed at the suitcase like i tried to

00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:58.799
think of why it was her fault in that

00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:00.159
moment i was like

00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:03.039
[ __ ] suitcases right there

00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:04.159
i like thought about her being like

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:05.760
don't put it there and i was like shut

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.120
up

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.320
i want to put it there if you didn't say

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.000
don't put it there i was so badly

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.520
wanting her to be her fault it was her

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.200
fault to me in that second yeah i was

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.040
just like it's not then i was like then

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.879
i got kind of disappointed myself i was

00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:18.159
like dude you're

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.320
crushing the vibe right now yeah you're

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.399
just bringing just nonsense well i guess

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:23.760
that's that leads to a better question

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.119
then or i guess a more specific question

00:34:25.119 --> 00:34:26.480
for your case

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.399
how is it that you deal with

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:29.679
disappointment

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:32.480
let it go yeah inside i let it go yeah

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.079
it's always chalk it up i chalk it up i

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:36.560
don't like be like it's just like

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.919
you'll get them next time dude yeah i

00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:39.520
don't harp i don't harbor it i just or i

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.560
don't like

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.760
you know

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.240
fixate on it i just go you'll get them

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.760
i think that's a good way to handle it

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.359
how do you feel like you learned that

00:34:47.359 --> 00:34:50.079
because i think that is the difficulty

00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:52.159
we all want to let it go but how do you

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:53.760
let it go how did you learn to let it go

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.079
what was that process like dude

00:34:56.079 --> 00:34:57.520
i'm going right back to david hawkins he

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.520
wrote a book called letting go

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.200
all that's all it's about is how to

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.800
surrender things and like just let them

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.560
go just because you don't control life

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.119
is that like totally in the way he says

00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:08.480
especially was a big thing like say you

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.560
get fired and lose your job you know oh

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.800
my god it's crazy you focus on the

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.040
smallest possible thing that you can let

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.200
go of about the situation and let go of

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.720
that so say it's like

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.240
well you know i kind of like driving to

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.440
work every morning for 10 minutes and

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.560
listen you're like well can you let go

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.599
of that it's like yeah i can let go of

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:24.720
that and once you start letting go the

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.839
small stuff you can work up to

00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:27.200
eventually be like i can let go that

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.160
whole thing

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.359
so i was finding like the smallest

00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:30.880
possible thing about the situation that

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.640
you can just be like that's fine and

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.720
then it'll just kind of cascade upwards

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.000
rather than trying to take on the big

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.960
one at first you know yeah that piece of

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.960
advice alone is worth listening to this

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.560
episode yeah the books fantastic i'm

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.960
telling you this is

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.160
people just hate applied kinesiology

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.520
just forget about that and read the

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.920
books and maybe it's right i don't know

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.599
i'm not against the idea of the applied

00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:55.760
kinesiology like i get this i'm very

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.160
into just kinesiology period yeah and

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.599
well you're above 200 that's why you're

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:02.800
life affirmative i can't help it

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.520
yeah

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.680
i'm like probably like around 269 like

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.000
as long as my cell as long as my back

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.160
two digits are 69 i'm good i don't care

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.960
for sure yeah so i mean but that's

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.000
that's cool i mean i hope that's

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.920
something that people can can take and

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.760
apply like letting go of the smallest

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.440
thing that you could possibly let go and

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.200
then moving on to the next

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.720
i don't think i've ever heard a better

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.440
way

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.960
to deal with that yeah dude's a genius

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.680
yeah this guy this guy was for real yeah

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.359
man i'm glad i'm glad you believed in

00:36:29.359 --> 00:36:31.359
his applied kinetiology enough to yeah

00:36:31.359 --> 00:36:32.960
man i just yeah i was like this sounds

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.240
cool to me and then i read the rest of

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.440
the stuff i'm like well this is cool i

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.880
don't care about that but this stuff's

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.680
cool

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.839
and it's like i try to do it to myself

00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:41.040
every now and again i'm like i don't

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.240
know man i don't know how this works

00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:47.119
that was actually the last time i was

00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:49.599
disappointed in myself i was driving and

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:51.599
trying to park my car

00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:53.280
no it was uh

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.160
yeah i was i know i was in new newark a

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.160
new brunswick to go to a show and like

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.920
britney the baby was sick and you know i

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.119
had to like go home and take care of the

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:02.560
baby and i was like pissed that i had to

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.800
leave i was i was upset with myself but

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.240
i was trying to answer questions on the

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.599
way out of the parking garage like

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:08.880
should i really go home and another

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.960
shorthand way to test yourself said make

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.320
this sign and see if you can break it

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.000
with your finger and i'd be like

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.200
i don't think i should go and i was like

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.720
dude just stop just go home

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.000
[Laughter]

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.160
i'm sorry actually it turns out the

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.480
universe is telling me not to through my

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.839
body

00:37:25.839 --> 00:37:29.359
this is truth detected

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.760
you gotta trust the science that was

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.800
disappointing

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.240
with that

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.370
science says

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.640
[Music]

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.560
in a parking garage and as you drive

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.400
like touching your finger that i was

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.480
deeply disappointed in myself i was just

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.920
like just go man

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.240
from the highway

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:03.040
[Laughter]

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.040
that is it's also i feel like you have a

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.800
sense of humor that helps with that you

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.640
know and which is why

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.960
the whole crux of this is to not have to

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.480
let go of your sense of humor because

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:17.520
when you can see how silly a moment is

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.200
like like in an argument because i need

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.839
any time we're in an argument

00:38:21.839 --> 00:38:25.200
immediately i see how much of an [ __ ]

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.880
i'm being even if i'm right

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.400
even when i'm like gloating and i'm

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.560
right and i'm like i'm ruining this now

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.280
yeah

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.880
really [ __ ] this up

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.040
and i can't stop like and then i'll like

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.880
poke my head in and be like you know i

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.320
was right right i'm like oh why am i

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.920
saying this

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.920
why am i saying this i don't even care

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.000
anymore you know yeah we just don't want

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.920
that yeah he still wants a dub yeah so i

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.440
mean like i feel like most of our

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.040
arguments what we do is we talk through

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.119
what we find funny about what we want to

00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:52.000
say

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.440
you know it's like oh i think it was

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.480
funny because i just want i wanted to

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.520
say [ __ ] you right now

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.640
i wanna it's funny because i wanted to

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.960
be it's not like a [ __ ] you [ __ ] isn't

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.520
that funny

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.480
yeah so um all right

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.599
it's just like that's so funny

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:12.839
we're such a good

00:39:12.839 --> 00:39:14.480
couple

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.240
and that's our third chakra that's our

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.680
shocker that deals with confidence and

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.640
self-esteem and that's in your gut yep

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.480
get your gut biome together you feel

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.839
good that you're yeah i just felt the

00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:26.160
shift i felt it oh man there we go are

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.560
you good yeah it probably probably also

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.160
allows you to hump better it like

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.320
facilitates the humping shot for sure

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.000
yeah yeah it's a fuel tank yeah

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.400
so we'll go to the next one and this is

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.320
i'm only i'm a little not concerned

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.599
about this but i'm just curious to see

00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:43.200
how this is going to go

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.280
but i guess the way i want to ask it is

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.200
like what have you learned from grief

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.839
um to be nice to people to be nice as

00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:53.359
possible to everybody

00:39:53.359 --> 00:39:54.880
yeah so

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.160
yeah when you're grieving that's that's

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.640
the one thing it's always like

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.400
i just want to be nice

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.280
and it's you know it's the only thing

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.320
that makes sense when you're grieving

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.880
it's like let me just not be a [ __ ]

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.160
how much do you feel like you carry that

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.560
over after the grieving period

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.160
i definitely think i did yeah yeah i

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.240
think it has oh yeah yeah that's what's

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.000
up i don't want to spend that much time

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.960
on that

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.079
they didn't spend that much time on the

00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:17.440
avatar they just kind of went through it

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.119
yeah i mean i don't know

00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:21.119
i'm not uptight about it it's just like

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:23.119
yeah yeah anytime i've been like when

00:40:23.119 --> 00:40:26.319
you really hit the [ __ ] like

00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:28.640
uh

00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:31.119
like there were there was a time when

00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:33.359
before maya was born

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:35.040
she shooting brittany was pregnant like

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.040
nine months pregnant with her and

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.720
we were sitting there and you know we

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.079
were having an argument nothing like

00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:42.160
that crazy but we were you know arguing

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.240
and i like went the room and she went to

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.920
go down the steps and then like slid

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.520
down the last like four or five just

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.359
walk down

00:40:49.359 --> 00:40:51.200
and uh you know i was nine months

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.280
pregnant i'm like [ __ ] i felt so bad and

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.800
then she she actually had like a little

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.160
bit of bleeding this might be a little

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.599
bit too much yeah yeah but in that

00:40:57.599 --> 00:40:59.520
moment i was like yeah you know i just

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.359
went black i was like what the [ __ ] did

00:41:01.359 --> 00:41:03.520
i do yeah that was like that was you

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.040
know it's a very small window of it but

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.480
it was that was like pure grief it was

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.119
just like yeah agony yeah yeah that's

00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:10.800
that's i mean it's like such a hard

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.880
thing to to translate

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.599
into another person's mind

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:16.560
so we

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.119
i mean we of course like you know uh

00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:20.400
like ainsley lost her mother recently

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.839
and that was trash you know that was

00:41:21.839 --> 00:41:23.680
that was a very difficult thing but

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.960
something that's slightly relatable to

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.720
what you're saying

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.359
uh so one of her twins

00:41:29.359 --> 00:41:30.400
her

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.480
we're again nine months pregnant close

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.400
to the end of this

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.359
and her heart had a little hole in it

00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:40.400
and it didn't finish closing up yeah and

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.520
you know they had to tell you remember

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.650
you remember really yeah

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.839
[Laughter]

00:41:45.839 --> 00:41:47.680
it was like it was it was presented to

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.359
us it's like oh don't worry about it

00:41:49.359 --> 00:41:50.720
this is something that's like this

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.839
happens it's probably just going to

00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:53.680
close up and you know we just have to

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.359
monitor it and

00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:58.240
until we found out the next time that it

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.680
did was it

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.319
dilated or undilated however the word

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:05.040
dilated was being used and uh

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.040
but that time period until i got the

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.040
information that it was okay

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.319
it was

00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:12.720
i mean i was already grieving

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.839
you know

00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:16.319
what could be the consequences of that

00:42:16.319 --> 00:42:18.640
situation and it was uh it was pretty

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.119
intense yeah dude yeah

00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:23.359
yeah it's a it's a horrible feeling

00:42:23.359 --> 00:42:25.680
yeah it was uh and i'm not even gonna

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.079
lie to you man i was already

00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:30.160
planning to be a curmudgeon for the rest

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.760
of my life like if something happened to

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.000
my daughter yeah like like that you know

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.440
i was just gonna like

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.880
how am i gonna [ __ ] be nice to people

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.400
you know it's crazy

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.480
but it's also the flip side of that is

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.760
like when you're actually in the

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.440
situation when a situation does occur

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.599
and you actually have to grieve

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:49.200
you do keep coming back to that like

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.119
that being nice to people you know yeah

00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:52.480
i think so especially you know it's just

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.920
like it just puts everything in

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.160
perspective it's like what the [ __ ]

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.680
it puts all of your other problems into

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.280
like absolute perspective but you're

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.079
like

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:02.000
why am i freaking out about this [ __ ]

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:02.960
yeah so

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.880
i feel like it's the same i'm gonna mess

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.480
up this thing like the same side of the

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.160
coin or whatever but like it always

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.079
makes me think like living i messed it

00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:12.400
up huh

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.160
the uh like living in the moment you

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.599
know because like

00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:17.440
um the same way like if you're living in

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.400
the moment like you don't want to live

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.160
in the moment and be addicted like you

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:23.640
want to live in the moment

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:29.750
[Laughter]

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.319
um

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:35.920
it's the other side of the same coin

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.440
yeah that's what i said the same side of

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.760
the coin

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.119
like she messes up phrases constantly i

00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:44.720
always i always know what she's saying

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.000
we're just communicating through symbols

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.839
dude the word words are just words are

00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:49.359
actually words are impediment to

00:43:49.359 --> 00:43:51.359
enlightenment yeah yeah so you're just

00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:52.560
shedding just

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.560
yeah

00:43:56.290 --> 00:44:00.160
[Laughter]

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.480
so all right that's that's that's our

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.400
heart chakra that's uh love and

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.720
compassion we are we're open and we're

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.319
becoming enlightening i feel it it's

00:44:08.319 --> 00:44:09.920
coming it's coming yeah i feel it

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.800
happening

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.720
uh this is more fun than i thought it

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.960
was gonna it's very fun yeah it would be

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.560
funny just to phone in all these answers

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.800
but i don't know

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.560
i don't know

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.960
i'm pretty

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.960
yeah that was dude i remember that was

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:25.920
like

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.520
it was only momentarily but it was like

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.480
before we went to the hospital and

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.079
everything got you know like oh no she's

00:44:30.079 --> 00:44:31.920
everything's good dude it was like

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.200
everything just went black i remember

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.839
just being like what the [ __ ] you can

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:37.760
get this sad

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.599
barely i remember just like clutching

00:44:39.599 --> 00:44:42.160
the counter and just being like

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.160
yeah and then finally like we're [ __ ]

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.280
going to the hospital and i was like are

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.359

her win every argument from now on no i

00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:53.680
don't do that it wasn't even my brain

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.040
wasn't even working on that level yeah

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.720
it was just like [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.560
[ __ ] [ __ ] when you say black was like

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.160
the world black and white

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.000
it was just your wife it was like a

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
blood

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.280
no it's like the blood got sucked out of

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.480
my body that's what i felt like i feel

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.319
like i had no blood in my body for like

00:45:12.319 --> 00:45:14.000
30 seconds and it all came back and i

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.200
was like no this is real and i was like

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.200
all right let's go deal with it yeah

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.200
it was bad it's wild

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.319
man

00:45:20.319 --> 00:45:22.000
ah it's just like it's like the way i

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.200
feel just hearing you say that like i

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.880
can feel it's like

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.800
sucks dude yeah and just for the record

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.359
matt does have a black wife because

00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:30.560
people don't believe me when i do stand

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.599
up they're like you really have a black

00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:33.599
wife i've seen people question you after

00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:35.280
showing it's all it's great shows i've

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.200

like wow that's crazy yeah why it's also

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.960
funny how easily people believe that i

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.680
have a white wife

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.400
i feel like that's the same side of a

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.960
different coin though

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.720
it bothers me

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.319
i don't even know why i mean i love

00:46:00.319 --> 00:46:02.079
we're both being accused of the same

00:46:02.079 --> 00:46:03.760
thing and i don't know what it is i

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.800
don't know what it is

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.119
oh man all right so we're going to move

00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:13.520
on to the next one i was really excited

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.359
about this one what is it yeah all right

00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:16.960
so this is uh

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.400
where we're at we're at the uh the

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.920
throat chakra nice right and uh this is

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.760
you know about trust and expression and

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.200
the way that we're gonna come at it is

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.560
um

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.480
what is your favorite white lie that

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.200
you've told and extra points if it's an

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.680
active white lie oh

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.920
god

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.480
my favorite white lie

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.160
because uh as you're thinking i can like

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.720
tell you one of mine growing up is uh i

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.599
used to tell girls that i met that uh i

00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:48.240
was born with a like i had a twin

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.319
that died it's not a white lie it's just

00:46:50.319 --> 00:46:53.599
an outright lie is it not like false

00:46:53.599 --> 00:46:55.599
white lies when you like smooth over a

00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:57.359
thing you don't want to talk about yeah

00:46:57.359 --> 00:46:59.359
but that's a falsehood

00:46:59.359 --> 00:47:03.119
falsely represented yourself

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.359
if that's what the bar hold on but it

00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:07.920
was it was it was an answer to why i was

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.319
such an animated over-the-top person

00:47:12.319 --> 00:47:13.760
but it was like rather than tell the

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.240
people oh because i i'm being raised by

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.760
a single mom that doesn't teach me

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.760
social boundaries fair you know it was

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.800
easy

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.559
okay oh yeah when it goes when the

00:47:22.559 --> 00:47:24.480
answer goes that deep i guess you get

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.960
kind of some breath and like white lies

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.400
depending on how deep

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.480
the truth is you know that's a fair no

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.559
that's fair yeah that's fair that's now

00:47:32.559 --> 00:47:33.920
i take everything i say back that's a

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.000
totally valid white lie yeah i did i did

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.640
tell uh girls in college that at home uh

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.640
before before school i was in a gang but

00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:44.640
a gang

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.240
that's actually that's yeah that's a

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.640
white lie yeah

00:47:53.839 --> 00:47:55.040
i don't know why everyone thinks my wife

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:58.200
is white

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:06.720
[Laughter]

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.119

oh the gangsters disciples yeah i

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.079
balanced their ledgers

00:48:12.079 --> 00:48:14.559
yeah i needed people to understand

00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:16.960
that i i did come from that life yeah

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:21.160
that i wasn't a threat true

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.599
so it was the easiest way for me to

00:48:23.599 --> 00:48:25.200
convey both things it's like oh yeah i

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.280

mean i was recruited to be in a local

00:48:32.319 --> 00:48:34.480
gang nice but it was like

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.839
i don't know just it just felt like i

00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:37.040
was gonna be hanging out with a bunch of

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.319
dumb dudes yeah it's kind of awkward

00:48:38.319 --> 00:48:40.800
it's an awkward process it wasn't for me

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.079

[Laughter]

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.559
yeah unless you can give me a syllabus

00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:53.599
of what we're going to be doing all day

00:48:53.599 --> 00:48:56.319
long at the game

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.079
my friend tried to get inducted or they

00:48:58.079 --> 00:49:00.000
tried to induct my friend in a gang when

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.440
he was in prison

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.040
um he said it was like they're really

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.720
sore about it they're white supremacists

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.400
yeah and he was like no i'm cool guys

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.760
and they're like you know they're not

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.280
like you know pa prisons is not they're

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.680
not as like strong or a threat yeah um

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.520
but he was he was saying they like gave

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.280
him a lot of gruff

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.559
they would like be like passive

00:49:16.559 --> 00:49:17.760
aggressive toward him they'd be like

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.960
[ __ ] guy doesn't want to be our

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.480
[ __ ] gang [ __ ] you dude you need to

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.040
be like sorry guys dude i just i want to

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.119
be a nazi right now kind of dealing with

00:49:25.119 --> 00:49:27.200
a lot right now

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.800
processing a lot i don't think becoming

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.960
an active nazi will help this process

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.720
i'm over here trying to open up chakras

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.160
dude

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.440
trying to reintegrate myself into

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.520
society i just don't know that becoming

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.520
a nazi is the right step right now for

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:45.000
me at this time

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.280
yeah i think i might have been

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.920
single-handedly responsible for

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.079
another gang

00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:53.760
existing because

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.760
when i did i really was like what are we

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.680
gonna do like

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.680
well they were like one of the answers

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.200
was that like you know we'll [ __ ] up any

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.160
other gangs nice like there is no other

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.200
gang oh there are no other gangs like

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.800
you're you're starting the first game

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.079
like what are you talking about and uh

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.680
i think they realize that and start like

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.000
telling people to form another gang they

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.440
like that gang started telling people

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.520
they should form another gang

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.200
and then like people formed another gang

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.480
and they fought him immediately

00:50:29.599 --> 00:50:31.040
i stopped being gay like we didn't want

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.390
to be a gang in the first place

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:34.480
[Laughter]

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.200
it was uh yeah that gang it was uh the

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.359
itinerary was get jumped by that game

00:50:41.359 --> 00:50:43.599
so it was like all the all the best

00:50:43.599 --> 00:50:46.079
fighters were in one gang yeah and they

00:50:46.079 --> 00:50:49.040
convinced all of like like the pretty

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.480
boy dudes that just want to punch in the

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.559
face they convinced them to start

00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:55.559
another

00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.880
and that was it was like you know it was

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.200
like un sanctions it was purely totally

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.280
illegal totally fine

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.359
i never realized until like now talking

00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:08.480
that out like how how much that made

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.800
sense to do as a dude yeah you start a

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.160
game with your boys and then you think

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.440
about the types of dudes you want to

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.760
[ __ ] up convince them to start a gang

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.359
and just beat them up for being on your

00:51:17.359 --> 00:51:19.359
turf yeah you can't have another gang on

00:51:19.359 --> 00:51:20.800
their turf it is it's like starting a

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.559
small country it's just that's all

00:51:22.559 --> 00:51:24.160
you're doing you're just messing around

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.400
you're just you're just playing like

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.720
clash of clans in real life basically i

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.880
don't have an ios yeah i'm just going to

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.720
go clash with these guys

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.720
yes a bunch of these guys

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.359
in real life so that was my that was my

00:51:37.359 --> 00:51:38.720
white lie

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.319
so what was what was your with your

00:51:40.319 --> 00:51:42.160
favorite

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.359
why that's actually okay um

00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:48.000
my favorite white lie

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.559
um well when i was just telling women i

00:51:50.559 --> 00:51:52.480
loved them when i was in high school

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.559
i guess if we're going to do that

00:51:54.559 --> 00:51:56.240
so the time i was incapable of actually

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.920
feeling the emotion i just was covered

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.640
that up i just think i love you

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.160
how many girls in high school did you

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.160
love

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.920
that there's a couple like three three

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.640
or four it's a lot of love yeah like in

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.000
four years

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.240
were they were they like deep deep love

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.400
three i would say three yeah a couple a

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.880
couple off the cuff i just love you i

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.839
love you you're drunk

00:52:20.559 --> 00:52:21.839
that was that was probably that was a

00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:23.599
pretty big white lie yeah i think i

00:52:23.599 --> 00:52:25.520
loved not only every girl that i dated

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.720
in high school but every girl i had a

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.480
crush on i think i went through a period

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.440
of loving you just love them

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.960
i was kind of i would fall in love when

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.160
i was younger i would talk to a girl

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.080
named like i love her so much dude

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:42.480
[Laughter]

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.240
i'd get her away message

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.160
[Laughter]

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.760
where is she

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.680
yeah but i can't think of it man in

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.960
terms of a white lie it's like

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.640
they're that you know if that's the bar

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.000
then i guess there's that but there's

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.760
also like

00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.359
i don't know man i just i guess a lot of

00:52:59.359 --> 00:53:00.880
times people tell myself and i go like

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.040
nice yeah it's my most common one like

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.079
nice

00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:05.599
my head i'm like i didn't

00:53:05.599 --> 00:53:07.119
all right so how do you feel about lying

00:53:07.119 --> 00:53:09.599
like how often do you lie anymore

00:53:09.599 --> 00:53:12.960
i try not to lie yeah and if i do

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.960
i try to address it immediately and be

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.520
like that was a lie yeah i lied

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:18.960
but i don't really have much to lie

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.000
about right now i've been i've been

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.200
living on the up and up so i don't

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.079
really

00:53:22.079 --> 00:53:23.280
yeah when was the last time you had to

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.440
be like that was a lie

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.640
uh i've

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.000
i peed the bed a little bit the other

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.160
night

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.640
the bed a little not a lot it wasn't a

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.480
full i can't say i fully peed the bed

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.480
but it was the most i'd peed the bed in

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.240
a long time just you watch the bed you

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.520
made it wet yeah

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.520
you know it was i was in a dream where i

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.119
had to pee the whole time and there was

00:53:47.119 --> 00:53:48.720

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.799
we're talking about base right now yeah

00:55:20.799 --> 00:55:21.680
right

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.680
when uh and this is a very common thing

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.440
when a guy and a girl they sleep

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.960
together they're living together and

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.799
when the guy wants to have they're

00:55:28.799 --> 00:55:30.960
already in bed and you want to have sex

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.640

like so most of that other stuff that we

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.319
normally have to do before getting to

00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:42.319

00:55:42.319 --> 00:55:44.319

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:53.200
use like the like there's like a boner

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.720
sonar system you can use where you just

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.559
kind of like pulse you get against her

00:55:56.559 --> 00:55:58.400
and pulse and if you get an echo pulse

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.000
they'll pull us back sometimes yeah you

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.520
get an echo pulse you're like nice i'm

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.960
in you kind of have to check you have to

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.400
send like two more pulses like was that

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.599
just a fluke

00:56:05.599 --> 00:56:07.680
and then you get nothing and you're like

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.839
[ __ ] dude that was just me i just i

00:56:09.839 --> 00:56:10.960
pulsed and thought it was another

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.799
another pulse

00:56:12.799 --> 00:56:13.760
dude

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.920
some of the i mean one of the most

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.000
embarrassing things is

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.720
when you when you when it's not a

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.440
like a sexual boner and it's just like a

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.520

medicinal boner more than anything yeah

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:34.640
this is just happening right now yeah

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:35.839
it's like

00:56:35.839 --> 00:56:37.440
yeah having a

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.000
non-sexual boner yeah that's which is

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.480
stop assuming most of my boners yeah

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.480
they happen they definitely happen i

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.480
think i've literally used that phrase

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.400
non-sexual boner

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.359

she likes to be big

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.200
little spoon is nice if you can get into

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.559
it just just let your guard down and

00:57:08.559 --> 00:57:10.319
take a little spoon for a while

00:57:10.319 --> 00:57:13.040
it's pleasant ansley has like uh it's

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.960
like she's like trans-romantic is that

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.400
is that a way to say it

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.480
like she wants to she wants yeah she

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.480
doesn't want to be a dude but she wants

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.280
like

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.960
all the stuff that the guy gets in a

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.119
relationship true like she wants the big

00:57:25.119 --> 00:57:26.960
piece of chicken she wants to be the big

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.040
spoon yeah you know you should always

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.640
your portion should always be bigger i

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.599
fight with brittany about that all the

00:57:31.599 --> 00:57:32.799
time yeah we make portions she's like

00:57:32.799 --> 00:57:34.799
you got more than me i'm like i i always

00:57:34.799 --> 00:57:36.799
will and i always should like yeah this

00:57:36.799 --> 00:57:38.240
is your portion this is mine he usually

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.000
lets me eat first then he takes what's

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.680
never left that yeah that's also a good

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.359
move too yeah because i just got tired

00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:44.880
of fighting over portion size where it's

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:45.680
like

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.000
you can't finish that

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.160
yeah

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.720
that's why i get it because i can finish

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:53.359
it

00:57:53.359 --> 00:57:54.880
my thing is like you can take more but

00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.240
i'm also going to take more and have

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.760
more than you yeah so it's like go ahead

00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.880
and load up your plate but there better

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.240
be enough for me to still have more than

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.680
me

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.119
if i see my plate she has more than me

00:58:03.119 --> 00:58:05.359
it [ __ ] me up i think it's so mad we

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.720
just like oh you know just like back and

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.000
forth so

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.920
yeah i think uh

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.440
i think we handled that the best way

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.920
possible

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.880
yeah all right so where are we at we um

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.319
throat chakra you feel it did it feel

00:58:24.319 --> 00:58:26.640
clear yeah it feels good all right cool

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.240
um dude asking people what they lied

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.839
about most recently is the funniest

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:32.480
[ __ ] question

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:36.319
i mean that's for extra points as far as

00:58:36.319 --> 00:58:37.920
uh higher consciousness is concerned you

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.319
can tell us any lie you know but like i

00:58:40.319 --> 00:58:41.680
would love to hear a recent one like

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:43.200

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.559
peed myself i peed the bed like three

00:58:44.559 --> 00:58:46.559
days ago that was very recent

00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:47.839
i would love if somebody had like an

00:58:47.839 --> 00:58:49.680
active white lie that they had to like

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:50.400
then

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.560
can i make a phone call

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:57.280
[Laughter]

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.960
all right so we're moving along we're

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.359
getting into like the intellectual

00:59:01.359 --> 00:59:03.680
part of it because we're so we we we're

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.280
pretty much

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.960
enlightened people at this point like

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.799
we're like you know you're

00:59:08.799 --> 00:59:10.319
like i feel like this is where a lot of

00:59:10.319 --> 00:59:11.680
people would stop

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.559
yes

00:59:12.559 --> 00:59:13.920
i have a lie that i haven't come clean

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.559
to the person without oh what that's we

00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:19.839
have yeah i was uh i was

00:59:19.839 --> 00:59:22.400
at work somebody had their dog there

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.880
and it was i went back to the office and

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.640
the dog was like out of the space it was

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.400
supposed to be in and it was just

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.160
growling at me and it was a little dog

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.839
though so but it was growling and it was

00:59:31.839 --> 00:59:34.480
yapping and i like had stuff to do and i

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.680
just laughed

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.079
i was just like okay dog

00:59:38.079 --> 00:59:40.880
and i left and then they got a phone

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:41.760
call

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:44.240
that somebody else came in and the dog

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.920
ran out of the place like out of the

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:48.640
building but hopped into somebody's car

00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:51.359
and i was like [ __ ] if like that dog ran

00:59:51.359 --> 00:59:53.599
away and like ran away yeah like that

00:59:53.599 --> 00:59:55.520
would have been my fault

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.359
like it was all okay

00:59:57.359 --> 00:59:58.880
wait when your fault

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.720
did they say hey watch my dog real quick

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.200
no no but i should have been like hey

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.640
your dog's

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.359
out your dog's like yeah but that's also

01:00:07.359 --> 01:00:09.200
talking people it's an interesting

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.520
ethical dilemma right so you go into the

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.200
room you see the dog is out of this

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.000
space now you went in you saw it you're

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.440
aware that the dog isn't where it's

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.280
supposed to be but i didn't even know

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.040
like like obviously the dog was not left

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.799
are you trying to get rid of this lie or

01:00:24.799 --> 01:00:26.480
like reinforce this lie what are you

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.799
trying to do

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.440
you didn't know that and you thought

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.960
this dog had been possibly kidnapped

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.119
like dog napped well i just heard the

01:00:39.119 --> 01:00:41.520
story afterwards and it was like

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.680
oh that could have gone bad

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.440
like right like that dog could have run

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.960
out of the building and like but it was

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.559
somebody else went in and let the dog

01:00:48.559 --> 01:00:50.400
out of the building like i didn't yeah i

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.839
would say that that person would take

01:00:51.839 --> 01:00:54.400
the burden yeah whoever opened the door

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.079
yeah yeah but the dog was already out of

01:00:56.079 --> 01:00:58.000
the space designated for don't worry if

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.920
the dog was in that space when the door

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.079
was open the dog would have been so far

01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:03.599
away from the door that he wouldn't have

01:01:03.599 --> 01:01:05.760
gone out yeah yeah so it's kind of like

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.960
it's the owner you brought you brought

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.559
your dog to work and you know something

01:01:08.559 --> 01:01:10.319
bad happened yeah yeah you can place

01:01:10.319 --> 01:01:11.520
that on it i have two dollars i couldn't

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.960
place that on anybody else yeah yeah is

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.319
that all is that off your chest or in

01:01:14.319 --> 01:01:15.920
your is that is that out of your throat

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.280
or in your throat yeah

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.359
i'm better now yeah you're better yeah

01:01:19.359 --> 01:01:22.079
what was the lie of it well like i tried

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:24.480
to tell the person like i came back and

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.520
your dog was out like when because i had

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.079
to call them and be like hey your dog

01:01:30.079 --> 01:01:31.680
when the when the dog got out of the

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.119

know it pushed its way out yeah yeah

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.000
yeah yeah but it was out of the space

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.520
but it wouldn't acknowledge the fact

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.359
that you had seen it and i didn't deal

01:01:49.359 --> 01:01:51.040
with this situation

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.960
yeah i didn't deal with the situation it

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.760
was like a it was a lie by omission yeah

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.200
mission on multiple levels because like

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.599
you didn't admit that you s

01:01:59.599 --> 01:02:00.799
oh yeah you just yeah it was the last

01:02:00.799 --> 01:02:02.240

to deal with hey can you put your dog

01:02:03.359 --> 01:02:04.720

that stuff yeah yeah yeah did the right

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.880
thing okay it was right there yeah

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.240

01:02:12.079 --> 01:02:13.920
yeah yeah yeah i feel better now i just

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.960
wanted to come with the journey and i

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.400
felt like i couldn't yeah because you

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.520
could you also said you didn't have

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.960
anybody to apologize to you you were

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.119
like do i have to apologize to somebody

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:24.000
i didn't want to apologize

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.680
you didn't want to all right

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.720
and then we got to the line you were

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.319
like i got to get this one no i couldn't

01:02:28.319 --> 01:02:29.599
do it how are you not every week just

01:02:29.599 --> 01:02:32.480
like nothing don't apologize to anything

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.520
but this is britney and she's like i

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.640
don't want anyone to apologize too i

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.559
think nothing yeah

01:02:36.559 --> 01:02:38.079
nothing back

01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:39.039
back yeah

01:02:39.039 --> 01:02:41.599
come on sure there's something there

01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:43.359
there are episodes where we have nothing

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:44.799
and then as we're talking we're like oh

01:02:44.799 --> 01:02:46.400
[ __ ] yeah

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.039
i'm sorry for

01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:53.520
[Laughter]

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.200
it's crazy how

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.720
uh how how quickly you can completely

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.559
forget that you did some [ __ ] yeah you

01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:02.960
know like absolutely just like

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.799
whatever that old lady needed what she

01:03:04.799 --> 01:03:06.000
needed to learn you know what i mean

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.160
like yup maybe i cut her off like right

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.640
before she got in line but yeah i turned

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.290
fast

01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:15.599
[Laughter]

01:03:15.599 --> 01:03:16.960
hey we're good we're getting up into the

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.920
intellectual stuff now uh so

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.760
again we'll see how this goes but

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.119
this is uh dealing with like the

01:03:23.119 --> 01:03:25.760
illusion of separation right so this is

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.760
the third eye yeah right we're up we're

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.839
up there right here we're into

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:32.319
and this is heavy [ __ ] so what are some

01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:34.319
things that you are something that maybe

01:03:34.319 --> 01:03:37.119
you you traditionally saw as separate

01:03:37.119 --> 01:03:39.760
but you're learning or are not they they

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.280
are one in

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.680
two sides the same side of the coin same

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.160
side of the coin yeah man

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:46.960
uh

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.799
things that i assumed were separate that

01:03:48.799 --> 01:03:50.799
i think are kind of

01:03:50.799 --> 01:03:53.440
conjoined now yeah yeah yeah yeah

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.039
something that uh

01:03:55.039 --> 01:03:57.119
i mean i guess i i kind of want i don't

01:03:57.119 --> 01:03:59.520
i don't want to say any more to kind of

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.319
uh

01:04:00.319 --> 01:04:02.079
you know you don't want to lead oh yeah

01:04:02.079 --> 01:04:03.599
i don't want to lead you know i just

01:04:03.599 --> 01:04:06.640
want to see how this gets

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.039
oh dude

01:04:09.039 --> 01:04:10.839
most easily it's just myself in the

01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:14.160
universe i would say i you know thought

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.839
of myself as a really separate entity

01:04:15.839 --> 01:04:18.000
but i've been reading a lot about

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
just how life started in general and how

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.319
it's you know there was one

01:04:22.319 --> 01:04:23.760
one thing i was reading was saying how

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.280
basically like a

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.520
like lightning hit the soil and

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.280
activated amino acids which then you

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.880
know form different combinations into

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.039
like different cells and amoebas blah

01:04:33.039 --> 01:04:34.480
blah blah

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.079
so you know reading about stuff like

01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:37.599
that and just kind of

01:04:37.599 --> 01:04:38.640
i think i was talking about it before

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.799
just just identifying with the parts of

01:04:40.799 --> 01:04:41.680
you

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.559
that are running on like electricity

01:04:44.559 --> 01:04:46.480
that kind of like primordial energy and

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.920
how it's like we're just made up of like

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.599
the basic stuff and it sounds like one

01:04:49.599 --> 01:04:50.720
of those things like we're made of star

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.799
dust yeah but it's like dude you know i

01:04:52.799 --> 01:04:54.880
think like uh all but four of the

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.720
periodic elements

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.799
or come from the nuclear reaction within

01:04:58.799 --> 01:05:00.799
like stars like they get so hot that it

01:05:00.799 --> 01:05:02.720
just spews out all of the stuff that we

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.960
kind of forms our material world

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.799
it's like just linking myself with that

01:05:06.799 --> 01:05:07.760
kind of

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.920
that i come from that i'm like nice you

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.839
feel confident that like you said at the

01:05:11.839 --> 01:05:13.119
beginning like your energy like when you

01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:14.640
die goes back into the universe like do

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.640
you think it goes back and like it's

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.960
just like a ball of energy around the

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.640
world do you think it's like you should

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.640
retain like your

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.599
your self-energy or whatever like

01:05:25.599 --> 01:05:27.839
like you can go like haunt your

01:05:27.839 --> 01:05:29.200
loved ones or like you know like you

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.319
know what i mean like i know what you're

01:05:30.319 --> 01:05:31.920
talking about

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.000
do you find individuality in that energy

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.920
or is it just like a massive energy that

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.760
like

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.039
i don't know because you're dealing with

01:05:39.039 --> 01:05:40.720
the infinite so it could be just both

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.880
yeah yeah you know what i mean yeah it

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.559
could still be that it also could be you

01:05:44.559 --> 01:05:45.839
know you might

01:05:45.839 --> 01:05:48.079
tap back into like

01:05:48.079 --> 01:05:49.680
the source of all things and you know

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.880
it's like

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.400
like well what's matt up to i'm like

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.559
[ __ ] that guy dude source back into the

01:05:54.559 --> 01:05:56.240
source of all things

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.760
but i don't know you know i have no idea

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.119
i just kind of like

01:05:59.119 --> 01:06:00.559
i just like that idea and i just think

01:06:00.559 --> 01:06:02.079
about it i'm like then you know he gets

01:06:02.079 --> 01:06:04.000
into like religious concepts you're like

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.160
rules it's a cool way to picture god

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.000
yeah as like all the energy in the

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.760
universe yeah yeah i've thought about

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.920
that a lot recently like cindy said with

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.559
losing my mom and i feel like recently i

01:06:14.559 --> 01:06:15.599
feel like

01:06:15.599 --> 01:06:17.839
like she is super present in my girls

01:06:17.839 --> 01:06:19.760
and it's like that continuation of a

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.200
cycle of like

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.960
you know like like i don't know i feel

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.960
like there's more to like

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.119
the lineage of like your family and like

01:06:27.119 --> 01:06:28.799
energy being passed down and like you're

01:06:28.799 --> 01:06:30.480
part of them they're a part of you and

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.640
like yeah exactly and that's the part

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.440
that

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.039
they're she they are

01:06:35.039 --> 01:06:36.240
her

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:36.960
that

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.799
you know it was like her you them but

01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:41.200
that unbroken life cycle is going now

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.880
they get to be two kind of new people

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.319
and personalities but it's really that

01:06:44.319 --> 01:06:46.079
same life energy that we'll just

01:06:46.079 --> 01:06:47.359
continue on

01:06:47.359 --> 01:06:49.680
really cool yeah i like to i also

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.559
so

01:06:50.559 --> 01:06:52.720
you know because i'm into communication

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.640
and i like to read books on information

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.400
and stuff i look at it as information

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.799
that gets passed on so

01:06:58.799 --> 01:07:01.200
as much as god would be like all of the

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.799
collective energy god is also all of the

01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:04.240
collective information that's what

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.319
that's what makes god all know it you

01:07:06.319 --> 01:07:08.960
know so like like

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.400
the energy

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.000
so again when matt's energy goes into

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
the the all-knowing

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.359
all the information he takes all the

01:07:17.359 --> 01:07:20.400
information with him puts that into the

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.920
into the collective

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.119
and that's how

01:07:23.119 --> 01:07:24.319
god is all that's how that's the

01:07:24.319 --> 01:07:26.640
omnipotence of god so like the

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:29.599
information then

01:07:29.599 --> 01:07:30.640
your mom

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.000
informed you

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.920
you informed your daughters

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.319
therefore your mom informed your

01:07:36.319 --> 01:07:38.880
daughter so of course

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.960
we're going to see a lot of your mom and

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.480
our kids

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.920
yeah that rules i like that kind of

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.000
stuff a lot of like how long after

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.359
there's you know you have your body and

01:07:47.359 --> 01:07:49.039
your stuff then there's like your the

01:07:49.039 --> 01:07:50.319
things you do

01:07:50.319 --> 01:07:52.480
the meaning that they kind of put out

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.920
into the world and the things that the

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.359
effects they have and like yeah that can

01:07:55.359 --> 01:07:57.760
travel like really far into the future

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.359
in bad ways too which is like that

01:07:59.359 --> 01:08:00.799
always kind of scares me straight of

01:08:00.799 --> 01:08:01.839
like

01:08:01.839 --> 01:08:03.760
just the thought of like [ __ ] up a

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.640
family line for like 800 years

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:09.280
yeah god damn what an [ __ ]

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.000
it kind of feels [ __ ] ruining like

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.960
five generations yeah you can do it

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.199
i can do i go and do it right now so

01:08:17.199 --> 01:08:19.600
easily i feel like uh

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.839
you know when if i listen to the stories

01:08:21.839 --> 01:08:22.719
that

01:08:22.719 --> 01:08:24.719
of that you know we all hear about our

01:08:24.719 --> 01:08:25.920
parents like i'm talking about auntie

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.560
and my parents um

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.640
it's they're kind of like like her dad

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.159
was kind of at the end of a line of

01:08:32.159 --> 01:08:34.719
[ __ ] up family and started i feel like

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:38.560
our family is the starting of like a

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.159
positive legacy

01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:43.120
for our combined family yeah you know

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.640
and uh

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:47.679
it's kind of neat yeah yeah yes

01:08:47.679 --> 01:08:49.759
and your your mother was our family

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.359
matriarch and that's kind of cool you

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:54.000
know so that's uh yeah i feel like we're

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.359
at the beginning of that now yeah well

01:08:57.359 --> 01:08:59.839
it takes hundreds of years like

01:08:59.839 --> 01:09:01.440
like you were saying like generationally

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.920
get two people who aren't just like

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.679
being absolutely disastrous to

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:07.279
themselves in the world i was like the

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.880
majority of people are just kicking

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.319
around and like

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:11.679
not i wouldn't say the majority not that

01:09:11.679 --> 01:09:13.199
bad but it's like

01:09:13.199 --> 01:09:14.719
there's a lot of people who are just

01:09:14.719 --> 01:09:16.880
kicking around and [ __ ] [ __ ] up dude

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.960
when you consider the luck it takes to

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.799
just be with a person that you can get

01:09:20.799 --> 01:09:21.920
along with

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.239
and then have kids with that person and

01:09:24.239 --> 01:09:26.640
then that person those kids

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.319
find somebody that they can get along

01:09:28.319 --> 01:09:30.400
with and build with

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.520
you know

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.279
which again

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:34.799
so those hundred years that it takes for

01:09:34.799 --> 01:09:36.400
like two people like one person in the

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.080
family to kind of like mutate out of it

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.759
and start not [ __ ] up

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:42.000
they can immediately have kids that go

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.239
right back into that old you know wheel

01:09:44.239 --> 01:09:46.400
house yeah so it's like

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.400
the fact that any family

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.159
you can look back in their line and see

01:09:50.159 --> 01:09:51.600
multiple generations of people that

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.839
don't suck is impressive

01:09:53.839 --> 01:09:56.400
yeah that's dude it's pretty nuts yeah

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.360
it's also this is a cool thing about

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.320
having kids because then you start

01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.840
thinking about like lineage and [ __ ] and

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.080
it's just so much better than being like

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.480
is this shirt cool

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.480
does this shirt look cool the shirt i

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.280
stole from target

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.440
no this pocket t when i lift my arms my

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.520
belly button

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.840
i hate this shirt

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.440
yeah and uh man this is uh all right so

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.040
we're we're kind of at the last question

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.719
here all right you ready for this yeah

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.000
all right so

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.679
what is the one thing that you don't

01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:27.679
feel like you can never give up

01:10:27.679 --> 01:10:29.760
one thing i could never give up yeah

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.520
and then of course why and then what

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.040
would it what would it mean to you to

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.120
give that up like why wouldn't you know

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.040
it's a good question

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.800
i have so many things i couldn't give up

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.719
the uh

01:10:40.719 --> 01:10:44.600
honestly dude it's like

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.679
i could never giving up well

01:10:47.679 --> 01:10:48.960
the main there's a million things i

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:49.840
could think like writing all these

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.880
things like i have to you know i like

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.920
that but the main one would be

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.480
giving up on not being like a miserable

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:58.320
[ __ ] yeah like just being like

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.679
[ __ ] i [ __ ] hate i'm just gonna be

01:10:59.679 --> 01:11:01.760
a miserable [ __ ] that's my ultimate

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.120
thing of like making sure i just don't

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.400
do that

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.679
you can become a miserable [ __ ]

01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:07.280
really easily

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.520
yeah but you know so that's the more

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.520
that's my more overarching thing i know

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.040
what i'm saying not giving up is giving

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.640
in to that

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.880
okay so help my [ __ ] brain for a

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.480
second because did you do you completely

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.320
understand that

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.520
all right so okay but that is

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.960
that's not a i know what you're saying

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.239
it's giving up you has like a thing

01:11:26.239 --> 01:11:28.080
you're doing i'm talking about not

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.760
giving up on not doing anything that

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:30.800
doesn't that kind of doesn't really

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.159
you're like not you're giving in to

01:11:32.159 --> 01:11:33.679
something yeah yeah so that doesn't

01:11:33.679 --> 01:11:35.920
count it's a bad answer the

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.400
i would i would more say uh but is that

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.320
like giving up hope of like like what

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.000
would what would drive you to the point

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.159
to give in to that

01:11:44.159 --> 01:11:45.600
just being a [ __ ] i guess i could just

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.719
give in to being a [ __ ] and just being

01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:47.920
like oh yeah this feels kind of good

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.120
actually i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.239
it for like a week and i'll stop and

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.920
it's like that's nice

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:55.679
now i would say uh

01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:58.400
i don't know dude i mean i i just

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.760
like i guess writing i like to write um

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.400
you know or just kind of like

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.320
i don't know i would have years ago i

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.120
would have been like i'm never going to

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.000
give it i'm never going to work for

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.360
anybody else now i'm like i'd go work

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.719
for somebody i don't care like you know

01:12:10.719 --> 01:12:13.360
if i had to i wouldn't cry about it um

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.080
so yeah i don't know i think it's just

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.320
not

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.400
i can't think of a thing i mean

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.280
obviously it's weed like yeah no

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.280
not giving that up so i've tried and

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.719
it's just like i've really come to the

01:12:26.719 --> 01:12:29.040
conclusion like if i just

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.120
keep this if i don't like pig out on

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.360
this and keep like a small respectable

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.800
amount of this and like a daily

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.320
functional use or like every couple

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.080
weeks or so

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.239
i'm better off like i've tried to quit

01:12:40.239 --> 01:12:41.520
weed and i've quit weed and it's like

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.120
this is the wrong move i've done this a

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.880
bunch of times i'm like i'm [ __ ] up

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.679
by not doing this yeah so probably weed

01:12:47.679 --> 01:12:50.640
yeah so i i guess then um that was a bad

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.000
answer i didn't know that that's

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.400
actually a really good answer because

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.159
so what is it that

01:12:56.159 --> 01:12:57.440
you would be giving up if you gave up

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.640
wheat

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.080
just the benefits of having it in my

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.719
system it like it's a net positive

01:13:02.719 --> 01:13:04.159
if i have if i you know if i if i'm

01:13:04.159 --> 01:13:06.480
abusing it it doesn't work for me but if

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.719
i have like if i abuse it that's one

01:13:08.719 --> 01:13:10.480
that i'm going to this far that way and

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.920
i swing the pendulum back it's like i'm

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.360
not going to have it at all and that's

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.199
an equal mistake to abusing it so i need

01:13:15.199 --> 01:13:17.120
to have a little bit of it in my system

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.480
this is just what i've learned how do

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.719
you manage that from not going one way

01:13:20.719 --> 01:13:22.640
or the other like are you

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.040
like does that does that now become

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.280
an additional feature of your life where

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.080
you have to manage your your weed smoke

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.760
in order to it's pretty easy for me not

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.520
to do it honestly because if i if i have

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.280
two i do always do edibles for the most

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.440
part if i have too much i [ __ ] freak

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.040
yeah i gotta hit i'll be in my bathroom

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.239
and be like

01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:41.760
like forget i'm in there for like 20

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.320
seconds and be like oh [ __ ] it's not

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.840
good so it's like i have the governor is

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.760
pretty good on me like if i redline that

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.840
i pay for it instantly i don't like guys

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.760
are like oh i just fell asleep it's like

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.920
i tortured myself for two and a half

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.880
hours

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.520
i lost my mind for like an hour

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.640
it's like you know that's you know so

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.640
it's easy to kind of keep the wheels on

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.760
but um

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.360
yeah i don't know i i think what i was

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.719
trying to say is the thing i don't want

01:14:04.719 --> 01:14:06.400
to give up is my quest

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.719
to keep moving forward and developing

01:14:08.719 --> 01:14:10.239
become complacent i would that's kind of

01:14:10.239 --> 01:14:11.760
what i was trying to say yeah yeah i

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.040
understand that

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.520
thank you for rewarding that for me

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.840
no i was that was i take equal fault in

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.640
that yeah no answer got it

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.320
kind of if a woman can get it was that a

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:22.670
white lie

01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:24.480
[Laughter]

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.080
did you really get that i think so i

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.400
mean yeah i think yeah what he just said

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.920
was that you you were thinking like his

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:30.880
quest

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.880
no i didn't word it that way but how did

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.080
you wear it in your head i ordered it

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.520
the way i said it like not giving in to

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.600
being a [ __ ] yeah similar it's a

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.880
very very versatile yeah just being like

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.440
[ __ ] it i'm giving in yeah you know this

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.040
villains that get their own hands dirty

so

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.440
now this is this is an absolutely uh fun

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.960
experience man i don't know if i

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.320
necessarily became enlightened but i

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.679
definitely got wiser like how did you

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:25.600
feel talking all this stuff out same

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.360
thing yeah kind of just went up probably

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.600
squeaked up a couple points on the scale

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.400
nice

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.800
i'm going more for kind of like

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.960
personal salvation right now over

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.520
enlightenment yeah so it's an attainable

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.120
goal what are those what is the

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.120
difference purifying the ego versus like

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.199
completely transcending it

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:44.560
okay

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.880
i think that's what we're trying to do

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.960
we just didn't know yeah yeah that's it

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.320
i think we're just trying to purify the

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.719
ego yeah so that we can

01:16:52.719 --> 01:16:54.239
like we're not necessarily trying to

01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:55.520
trend we're trying to have a higher

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.760
consciousness and then like do fun [ __ ]

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.920
with it yeah you know yeah i feel like a

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:00.960
lot of people try to get a higher

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.480
consciousness and just like float it off

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.480
into the ether yeah we're trying to like

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.840
get a higher consciousness and tell

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.159
better dick jokes yeah like that that's

01:17:08.159 --> 01:17:10.000
salvation territory yeah it's personal

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.400
