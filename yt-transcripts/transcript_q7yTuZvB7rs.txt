anything in the world some kids you know

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.890
they made the sacrifice I needed for

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.300
Penn State to be brought to justice

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.760

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.860
the dad the mom was in school I was like

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.290
15 and the dad was like he paid a

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:18.970

the the tool we have at our disposal

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.299
yeah and then yeah

00:23:57.299 --> 00:23:59.789
the group the mob mentality thing of

00:23:59.789 --> 00:24:04.440
just piling the [ __ ] on people yeah Wow

at least let it breathe man figure out

00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:08.940

the thing again it the things cut and

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.879
dry it's just the process that has been

00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:27.059
set up it's just like you know I mean

00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:29.159
again it's like it only this all this

00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:31.889
stuff Perdue it promotes trad values the

00:24:31.889 --> 00:24:34.529
only way away from this is just to be

00:24:34.529 --> 00:24:37.019
like a conservative traditional for dude

00:24:37.019 --> 00:24:38.700

Glenn Loury Sam Harris they break it

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.629

you know sometimes black people suck to

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.629
[Laughter]

00:29:28.629 --> 00:29:31.909
to word it as safely as possible and

00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:34.039
their message was like also I believe

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:37.250
black people might suck also have you

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.850

physiologically aroused and you're just

00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:51.740

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.490
nobody's not listening to that who

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.470
disagrees with it yeah what the [ __ ]

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:59.539
this is [ __ ] [ __ ] dude he builds

00:29:59.539 --> 00:30:01.639
an argument that's just like the fact

yeah yeah Sam Harris it was just making

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.300
me laugh cuz obviously I think Sam

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.670
Harris is very very smart and yeah sure

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.860
I've only like 20 minutes in but he's

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.600
just funny to set up all the [ __ ]

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.940
like defenses it's really set up like

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.190
the police are bad doing bad thing like

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.050
you guys just put up all these defenses

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.910
just to try to get a point out yeah and

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.800
his point is like maybe their culture

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.250
finally if you get to the whole thing

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:38.100
it's uh there's ten million there's ten

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.780
million arrests a year yeah and a

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.040
thousand people get killed from the

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.660
police out of the thousand people get

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.360
killed from the police you know a good

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.800
chunk of them are armed white and black

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.530
it's 25% black it's like out of the

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.000
thousand murders twenty five percent of

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.560
their black fifty percent are white

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.720
twenty five percent or other and the

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.180
years that violent crime was higher

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.830
police murders are higher now Violent

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.420
Crimes actually gone down murders have

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.740
gone down police murders have gone down

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.630
jump set a low exactly thanks everyone

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.280
thank basically all the pedophiles are

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.900
causing police murder so Trump stopped

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.910
all the pedophiles but that that was

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.320
that was the whole thing it's like with

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.330
violent crime comes violent encounters

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.280
with police comes incident on police

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:14.640
deaths

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.440
it's like it's not an argument for being

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.760
like well just get over the ones that

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.290
have like we're totally unjustified

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.330
but it's like for the media to be like

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.030
this needs to stop and it's like yeah

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.200
obviously need to stop right now yeah

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.400
it's like and that was the other thing

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:26.820
it's like you

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.960
don't hear about all these other people

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.340
who get murdered by the police for a

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.210
reason because they're building a

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:31.289
narrative and they want to divide people

00:32:31.289 --> 00:32:33.809
that's all but to say that you have to I

00:32:33.809 --> 00:32:36.419
say in Harris has to be like I think

00:32:36.419 --> 00:32:38.720
slavery was bad I'm just saying yes and

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.220
here's some statistics that everyone

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.779
should know it's just like you might

00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:44.279
hate this but that's what that's what it

00:32:44.279 --> 00:32:46.019
is in the news where you live in a

00:32:46.019 --> 00:32:47.399
country where you flick a channel and

00:32:47.399 --> 00:32:50.000
you were being propagated I know I

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.350
mostly I never trusted the news but now

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:54.179
I can be like I'm pretty convinced less

00:32:54.179 --> 00:32:57.090
people slide me another dose that it's

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.190
propaganda it's literal propaganda to

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.720
serve political interests or a court

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.789
which are really corporate yes that's

00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:04.529
the news it's NASA is what it is and if

00:33:04.529 --> 00:33:07.139
you believe the news you fail dude it's

00:33:07.139 --> 00:33:08.070
an intelligence test

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.539
I believe it you felt of it I'm sorry

00:33:09.539 --> 00:33:11.279
trying to break Phil from the Fox

00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:13.320
you can't man I've been trying to break

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.850
the boy they can't make their heads

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:16.470
can't take it because we kind of grew up

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.580
with the Internet where we were able to

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.019
like watch all that stuff it's the same

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:19.980
thing every time where it's just like

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.340
well what do you think CNN is I'm like

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.860
yeah yes exactly you're watching CNN by

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.629
watching Fox dude explain stop

00:33:27.629 --> 00:33:29.159
explaining the people that they're the

00:33:29.159 --> 00:33:31.019
inverse of the thing they don't like

00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:32.639
it's like it doesn't there's something

00:33:32.639 --> 00:33:34.409
it just realizes that it cannot go

00:33:34.409 --> 00:33:35.820
through it's like yeah that's one

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.500
version of it you're the opposite like a

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.419
negative image under that but I

00:33:39.419 --> 00:33:41.159
definitely like being in New York and

00:33:41.159 --> 00:33:42.750
then being home and [ __ ] and like

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.610
sitting at a table with people that like

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.139
at dinner like yeah you came and talked

00:33:46.139 --> 00:33:48.690
to these people is there I'm like dude

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:49.379
you know they're having the same

00:33:49.379 --> 00:33:50.970
conversation in their house right now

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:52.559
yeah the people in New York like these

00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:54.000
[ __ ] idiots down there they have no

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.320
idea if you have a character like

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:59.399
[ __ ] the idiots no idea it's the same

00:33:59.399 --> 00:34:00.809
[ __ ] thing it's crazy

00:34:00.809 --> 00:34:02.850
yeah man but that's that's like so I

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.139
watched that I'm like all right we're

00:34:04.139 --> 00:34:06.419
being propagandized this is and it my

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:08.730
question is now like what do they

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:09.929
[ __ ] try it what are they trying to

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:12.060
do cuz it's like historically you see

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:12.869
and I've talked about this yesterday

00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:15.060
it's like there's been things that have

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.129
been introduced like the when Bush

00:34:17.129 --> 00:34:19.050
wanted to get elected there was like I'm

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.550
tough on crime yeah the news is just

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.139
like black eyes getting jammed against

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:23.760
cars constantly and like [ __ ] like

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.500
neon green t-shirt it's just big up

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.419
against cars but there was that one who

00:34:27.419 --> 00:34:29.040
was that one guy you're like he got off

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.980
I forget it was somebody that Dukakis

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.829
let out yeah Bush one guy ran an article

00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:38.190
Arab total ad on TV a national ad that

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.889
was like Dukakis led this black dude out

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:42.629
and raped and murdered right away it's

00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:44.329
like I wouldn't do that [ __ ] you think

00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:46.829
it's funny to us by that logic Bush is

00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:51.089
like I wouldn't let any of them out Bush

00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:53.149
for president oh they're in there oh

00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.470
yeah so they do that with blush that we

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:57.240
got all like the you know heavy drug

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.890
things of like now you go away for 25

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:02.130
movie cocaine no I think I'll it was

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:03.930
Oliver Stone he did a documentary Arab

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:07.500
movie on george w bush but it showed the

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.930
port the part where his dad was in

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:12.329
office and like they care yeah cuz he

00:35:12.329 --> 00:35:15.960
was no he's a head of the CIA right

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.279
anyone to it must have just been running

00:35:17.279 --> 00:35:19.109
for wait did he did he have two terms

00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:21.180
now he lost the second term to clinton i

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.579
think so i don't know i know he had one

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:25.289
oh wait he was the vice president when

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:28.349
he won he won a war right I've know I

00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:30.150
know he was in the CIA and I know he was

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.470
before Clinton that's all I know my

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:35.180
history facts are pretty bad Jamie uh

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.089
well he was vice president when he ran

00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:41.099
possibly resident possibly oh I got

00:35:41.099 --> 00:35:44.039
you're saying he's Reagan's yeah yeah he

00:35:44.039 --> 00:35:46.880
was Reagan's vice president okay in 88

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.369
so in 92 they slid from the ad he slid

00:35:50.369 --> 00:35:52.440
right out of the crack epidemic one in

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.319
292 it's when the chronic drop and then

00:35:55.319 --> 00:36:01.890
94 was Clinton 2 mm and that 2092 it

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.019
must've been 92 yeah 9 when he lost to

00:36:04.019 --> 00:36:06.480
Clinton and then Clinton took over and

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.150
then W got in there in 2000 and then

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.390
9/11 happened yep

you have like these harsh racist crime

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.470
bills that got passed through yeah then

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:24.240
after 9/11 we have the Patriot Act that

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.710

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:33.750
pretty much throughout every president's

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:35.190
the presidency there's been humongous

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.539
lies in the news that you know are

00:37:36.539 --> 00:37:38.609
pretty mainstream central issues of you

00:37:38.609 --> 00:37:40.259
know different things and now it's like

00:37:40.259 --> 00:37:42.539
there's another narrative that's totally

00:37:42.539 --> 00:37:44.309
off you know off of a full statistical

00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:46.200
picture and it's like it's still going

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.549
right to people spinal cords and they're

00:37:47.549 --> 00:37:49.559
just like yeah it's you know it's hard

00:37:49.559 --> 00:37:50.579
to watch you know it is true that

00:37:50.579 --> 00:37:52.680
anytime there's like this level of like

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.420

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.650
and you're right that there is

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:57.660
definitely something that's why

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.099
something bad is coming what's coming

00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:00.930

00:40:25.099 --> 00:40:31.609
Pythagorean aimed after but menstral

shows was like the they were huge hit

00:40:34.249 --> 00:40:37.459
like oh my gosh face shows herself I

00:40:37.459 --> 00:40:40.699
think that's Jim Crow what you know that

00:40:40.699 --> 00:40:42.109
Jim Crow laws and all that so let me

00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:44.179
reset my posture I could be wrong but as

00:40:44.179 --> 00:40:47.359
Jim Crow just like black mandate a black

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:50.299
person who Jim Crow is stop tell me he

00:40:50.299 --> 00:40:51.829
was hold on faced superstar let me Jamie

00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:53.630
that Jamie that for me Jim Bowie

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.939
actually is Jim Crow because it it

00:40:55.939 --> 00:40:58.369
sounded like Jim Crow was an old black

00:40:58.369 --> 00:41:01.789
dude that was working and a theatre

00:41:01.789 --> 00:41:04.130
theatre dork heard him singing and was

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.140
like that's the ticket and then went

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.359
blackface and just repeat I found all

00:41:08.359 --> 00:41:10.429
Jim Crow and he was saying like this and

00:41:10.429 --> 00:41:12.019
my and people were like this is the

00:41:12.019 --> 00:41:15.049
[ __ ] she really I could be wrong on

00:41:15.049 --> 00:41:17.359
that I swear to God he was singing about

00:41:17.359 --> 00:41:19.270
Jim Crow

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:22.550
wikipedia says is a character biography

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:26.450
rising yeah yeah Jesus Christ Jimmy grow

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.940
was not like when you hear like Jim Crow

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.200
laws it's like that must been like a

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.000
shitty senator so I thought it was no

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.280
Jim Crow was just like a dude working so

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.020
and some [ __ ] theater dork

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.480
saw him put on blackface imitated him

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.890
and was like dude was selling out

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:42.140
theaters so he Jon Lovitz Tim he was

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.760

ticket oh yeah he's losing his mind and

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.160
I'm reaping the benefits so so then what

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.349
happened was all like music in America

00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:53.270
became just white people wearing

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.829
blackface

00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:57.109
imitating black songs that was for a

00:41:57.109 --> 00:42:00.020
while for a while I must have been crazy

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.060
he was killing it but there were also

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.710
black performers doing the exact same

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:05.480

like yeah cuz the pay is what you it was

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:27.740

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.319
wear when you do these songs yeah so

00:42:30.319 --> 00:42:31.819
black dudes that we're doing them would

00:42:31.819 --> 00:42:33.500
put on blackface boy he's like secret

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.270

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:45.410
blackface is like perfectly done like

00:42:45.410 --> 00:43:05.810
Brown was interesting Oh Jim Crow I

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:09.020
figured Jim Crow was either a I figured

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.550
Jim Crow based on the name that doesn't

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.890
sound like a waspey Senatorial name from

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.569
back then I figure did Jim Crow was just

00:43:14.569 --> 00:43:16.640
a guy who got like lynched those doesn't

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.530
do with other was it do with a vision or

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:20.150
committed suicide I thought I thought

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:22.400
Jim Crow was a white guy who was like I

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.920
got an idea check this out yeah I

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.750
thought it was a white dude no I figured

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:29.060
Jim Crow is either like a victim of the

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.430
crimes

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:32.079
or that but no it turns out he was just

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:35.589
a dude working perhaps a slave who got

00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:38.079
swag stolen you could totally go to swag

00:43:38.079 --> 00:43:40.059

a failing actor dude

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.490
just being like I think I think

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:53.200
capitalized I'm more insane it's going

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.660

00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:25.569
like a talent show some guy just did

00:44:25.569 --> 00:44:26.859
like the fiddle and other guy comes down

00:44:26.859 --> 00:44:28.420
like holy [ __ ] people most immediately

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.030
burst into laughter boy yes in the in

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:33.490
the incredibly powerful podcast 16 19

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:34.900
that's just all of my listeners listen

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.750
to it I'm sure you guys are gonna love

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.339
it finally listeners would love they

00:44:39.339 --> 00:44:41.500
love a 60 90 I said oh I've listened to

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.960
a whole podcast about it and I just

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.369
forget I know like it's like you want to

00:44:45.369 --> 00:44:48.220
want to change a historical thing to

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.490
like 16 19 rather than 1776 so you don't

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:52.690
like that way you don't celebrate the

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.309
founding fathers you celebrate yeah the

00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:56.290
slave labor that's what I think the idea

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.540
behind this is yeah thank you

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.250
there's gonna be some disappointment

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:02.530
when they find out a lot of who owned

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:03.190
slaves

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:05.980
what do you mean if you look into

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.140
history kind of everyone everyone had

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.079
him literally everyone had him really no

00:45:11.079 --> 00:45:13.180
I mean every race had him yeah yeah like

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.700
the Prophet Muhammad yeah yeah Prophet

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.859
Muhammad which is ironic cuz he you know

00:45:17.859 --> 00:45:20.410
you hear a lot of people he's like a lot

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:23.440
of uh black militants change their name

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.260
to Muslim names yeah we don't want the

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:29.079
slave owners name just like ya guys

00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:32.109
gonna be bummed out that the Prophet

00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:34.210
Jesus in half slave yeah who didn't have

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.000
sighs Jesus Jesus had disciples Jesus

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.440
that's that's pretty much the only

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.500
person I'd it's funny too because Arabs

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.819
tend to go with the exact same thing why

00:45:42.819 --> 00:45:43.930
dudes do when

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:46.030
when defending slave owners like they

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.760
treat him well yeah dude that's the Arab

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:49.690
defense it's like well we didn't

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:51.160
commercialize it yeah we're gonna talk

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.230
about that because we it was like

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:54.880
anybody who had him as the exact same

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.340
defense where it's just like well we did

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.470
better we do it they liked it that was

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:01.030
yeah that was no I've heard that before

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:02.350
about the Arabian slaves in there I've

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:03.460
read this in an article where they try

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.080
to justify being like look it wasn't

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.460
anything like the farms in the South

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:09.040
like it was like it was just the desert

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.620
busy war everybody was having fun busy

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.690
work it was a desert and choryo law

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:16.330
there's no way it was brutal well they

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:18.760
also uh then I read about GAAP they had

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.530
like full-on galley slaves though where

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:21.700
you would just be in the bottom of a

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.920
boat well the day died dude just on the

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.760
[ __ ] source power

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.490
yeah just chained it like three other

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:29.740
dudes just like a human motor basically

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.950
just [ __ ] oh I'm in damn did you get

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:35.530
ripped no doubt well that was you know

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:37.450
that was it that much those types we

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:39.970
talked about last last yesterday cuz I

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:41.770
was I've been looking into the slave

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:43.930
revolt in Haiti yeah that must have been

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:45.460
a rough one when one of those [ __ ]

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.380
one of those engines decided to [ __ ]

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.800
turn over on you this is Jack 290 Jack

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.340
dudes like computerized cars we were

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.690
like what if the computer freaks out and

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:57.430
it's like veers me into a tree it won't

00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:58.810
they're all like the whole side was like

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:00.340
pushing left and the [ __ ] was like [ __ ]

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:05.620
[ __ ] yeah oh dude that's uh yeah we were

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.330
saying that yesterday about like and

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:08.890
that's something I would love to know

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:11.200
about how people who owned slaves slept

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.490
at night without being like just being

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:13.990
like I hope these guys don't [ __ ]

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:15.970
come [ __ ] me huh Haiti they were like

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:17.680
super paranoid about getting poisoned

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.810
yeah that was one thing that like all

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:21.820
for some now for some reason that's

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:22.960
because they were torturing everybody

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.240
yeah torture to everyone on the island I

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.590
wouldn't be able to eat dude and then

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:29.200
yeah one day you know I know there was a

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.610
bunch of different factions yeah and the

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.680
Haitian Revolution yeah there was the

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.500
the rich whites they were this guy puts

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:36.550
it as the big whites

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.860
yeah so that was like the you know kind

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.380
of royal major major for the bezos the

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.120
burgers the bezos but the burgers and

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.460
basil yes and then then there was the

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:46.750
small whites that were like middle

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:48.420
management mm-hmm then there were the

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.850
free coloreds yeah they're called that's

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:54.310
what they're called Haidee and then

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:55.990
there were the slaves and so literally

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:57.430
when everything broke up and

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:58.960
that revolution started they all just

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.050
formed their own factions but this was

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:04.000
interesting to me the small whites and

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.950
the black folk not the slaves slaves

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:08.309
never really had any support yeah the

00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:11.920
free slave boning black people and the

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.950
white people had mutual interests which

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:17.349
was [ __ ] the big whites yeah we want our

00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:19.569
own [ __ ] and the way the big whites

00:48:19.569 --> 00:48:22.890
separated them was racial division and

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:25.809
racist laws basically Jim Crow laws they

00:48:25.809 --> 00:48:27.520
put him on yeah they instilled them in

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.410
them so he may be like oh these guys are

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:30.430
starting to get along and they're gonna

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:32.140
start [ __ ] with our [ __ ] we better

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.400
separate this entire population with

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:39.490
like pointless racist laws okay the

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:40.809
white people like head south give it

00:48:40.809 --> 00:48:43.150
away people a slight advantage from the

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.190
black people and then so that the black

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:47.260
people would complain yeah why the [ __ ]

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.490
are we doing this and then the white

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:50.160
people that are getting benefits like

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.530
you shut up yeah you're lucky that's

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.290
fair yeah this is fair you know and then

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.030
eventually the slaves just you know they

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:02.500
got machetes goddamn off dude and Haiti

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:03.760
this was the scariest part

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.829
Hades like all sugar cane it was all

00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:07.569
sugar cane yeah which it apparently like

00:49:07.569 --> 00:49:09.520
burns like super easy yeah it's like

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.140
right away the slaves just live fight so

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.609
the whole island was like burning and

00:49:12.609 --> 00:49:14.799
when they get and then they started both

00:49:14.799 --> 00:49:17.140
sides just committing like the scariest

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.510
atrocities yeah islands on fire dude I

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:22.900
on fire and if either side got captured

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:24.640
you're getting tortured so it was just

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.579
bands of roving dudes just like we're

00:49:27.579 --> 00:49:29.079
killing everybody that we see you know

00:49:29.079 --> 00:49:30.730
our you know one are you afraid of the

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:32.170
dark that's the powder they throw on the

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:35.020
fire to make you go up sugar really yeah

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.599
put sugar on it up dude sugar can ignite

00:49:37.599 --> 00:49:39.700
are you afraid of the dark sugar that's

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.079
what it is I used to do it on my stuff

00:49:41.079 --> 00:49:46.210
told you that your chiropractor white

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:49.480
powder I'm not afraid to die anyway I

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.549
that's my theory because I said when I

00:49:51.549 --> 00:49:52.930
was little I said it was funny ice puts

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:54.430
sugar on my stove and it would go pull

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:55.869
and blow up so I'm like I think that's

00:49:55.869 --> 00:49:56.859
where they threw all the flames and are

00:49:56.859 --> 00:49:58.150
you afraid of the door no so you came up

00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:59.559
with it that's my theory yeah think you

00:49:59.559 --> 00:50:01.119
might be right I think it's sugar dude

00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:02.950
there was no you just solidified it

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:04.420
though I've been working on a theory for

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.130
like 15 years now you've said sugar

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:09.220
canes like powder sugar is pretty 1521

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.680
you watched

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.930
it's like 30 years in the minnows about

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.000
your 25 year theater two-year theory

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.710
right there you just gave me the equals

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:21.730
MC series dude just got bonked yeah

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:23.770

like an article about coffee and they're

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:41.950
saying that guy I think left England and

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:44.589
he was like I'm gonna start a coffee for

00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:45.820
him where you can actually grow coffee

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:47.650
like when coffee was becoming the egg so

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:48.790
you just went to some other country and

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:49.780
there was like a bunch of indigenous

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.460

down that ramp everyone was saying he

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.150
doesn't have anymore as I dude he just

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:21.460
yeah he just gained some speed because

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.470
it was the terrain was slippery so he

thing to watch is people that tweet and

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:50.290

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:08.680
to be propped up by some sort of

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.359
external apparatus that's like pumping

00:57:10.359 --> 00:57:12.220

mm-hm and then when I put on the

00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:02.980
revenant mm-hmm might be the least that

00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:04.660
might be the worst Bay movie oh dude

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:06.040
it's Krypton I don't know if there's one

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:08.380
if you want to get Bay repellent you

00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:09.850
want your lady to go to sleep or leave

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:12.310
put on the revenant but on there will be

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:14.140
blood the revenant or No Country for Old

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:16.540
Men and the bays are asleep or yelling

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:19.510
yeah quickly it's because there's a

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:21.280
thought about it why isn't the revenant

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.380
there's not a lot of dialogue mmm it's

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:27.070
just one guy doing things and normally

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:33.400
you have to like it's the dolly the dog

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.070
brains need like somebody's saying what

00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:38.260

but a lady in that lady's defense though

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:29.170
what percent of crimes do Frankenstein's

you know commit

01:03:31.610 --> 01:03:35.150
she was right to be afraid statistics if

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:36.740
she backed it up yeah if she had backs

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:39.500
it up signs and ghosts have committed

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.360
almost zero crunch ghost of a couple of

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.000
no no ghost there's paranormal activity

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.350
how many people are they documented

01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:46.550
you'll have been yanked out of bed by

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:51.350
their ankles they need to start these

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:53.360
are stats I mean the FBI doesn't have

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.830
unfortunately then I'm a good database

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:57.970
on people being Yanks on the Trump would

01:03:57.970 --> 01:04:00.290
actually start to look into the idea of

01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:02.480
ghosts well dude how about when they

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.820
released aliens on us in the middle of

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.050
Kovac they're like oh by the way there's

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:10.370
aliens and totally blew through a new

01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:12.320
cycle I was like yeah we know anyway

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.610
what's up with this [ __ ] virus and

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:14.840
they're like yeah what's up with our you

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.740
know the threat to our lives yeah well

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:20.450
they're trying to say now space forces

01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:22.580
because of they've no like alien we have

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:23.870
to kind of deal with aliens on the sly

01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:27.010
right now you probably love aliens dude

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:29.420
that'd be sick if aliens were like

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:31.520
immigrants who are just like Trump is a

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.090
strong leader yeah we always think of

01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:37.250
aliens of having like our values they

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:38.990
could just be like Indian dudes they

01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:42.920
could be here for nudes like they need

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.540
our resources to say no they're just not

01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:47.720
even down like send us your mobs and

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.580
they do love try Indian dudes love Trump

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:50.840
that's a lot of people don't know that

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.300
yeah Indian dude remember that Stadium

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.830
he had packed and he was like trying to

01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:59.000
use like after Jambi Raja Rodney like

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.160
speak yeah we know him

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.840
yeah and by the way this is one of your

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.090
this is basically I'm using your logic

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:06.800
on this like I talked to one Indian dude

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.780
in an airport I'm like Indian dudes love

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.150
Trump they're not indeed ooh it was like

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:13.310
he is good the business is terrible

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:16.100
India really yeah my Indian impression

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:18.680
that was bad what's my India you think

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.420
you lost it yeah I think I used to be

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.640
able to do it if he a man fortunately

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.320
the way to get into it to like start

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.670
practicing again is you gotta imitate up

01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:28.280
ooh yeah that's what is the most racial

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.080
thing you can say that's the game no

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.580
that's like anyway we're gonna yak so

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:35.600
you go back and that's the worst you

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.520
know sure can't just long chain to other

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.830
services came on yes he's costing

01:05:39.830 --> 01:05:41.870
disgusting be you're absolutely right

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:44.150
then you can't launch into a you know

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:45.290
game

01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:46.850
good in you yes that without the

01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:49.280
practice if you ever since garner you go

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.420
you got bring him in your head and

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.370
figure it out yeah and then you can go

01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.880
from there

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:57.110
Joe Trump is a good leader there you go

01:05:57.110 --> 01:05:58.850
working on it that's pretty good but

01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:02.660
yeah apparently there's this Indian

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:04.690
dudes just got beat up by the Chinese

01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:06.230
pretty badly

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:08.930
that's I know India whatever conflict

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.730
again I'm still trying to figure out why

01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:12.160
Chinese people called sino

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.570
which is I don't understand well maybe

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:15.470
that's just a thing for like the whole

01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:18.050
day rusev rusev yeah Rousseau Snyder

01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:19.820
Japanese well I think it was I think

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.140
they're not allowed abbreviate Chinese

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:23.810
cuz it's like you just slap the S all

01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:29.810
kind of Chinese name what's wrong I

01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:32.030
think sino is the reason is it people

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:33.530
cries at night does not Chinese see no

01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:35.720

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.080
funny seiderman kill they think killed

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.420
uh like ten Indian dudes on the border

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:45.320
thing yeah what they do I don't know

01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:51.590
about neighborhood fights it was just

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:53.360
fisticuffs yeah and then they got into

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.120
like London stabbing territory so it's

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:57.290

01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:22.540
the hill it's just them being like I'm

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.250
pretty sure this is ours no yeah no I

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:25.630
check out our map and they're like well

01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:27.099
this map says it's mine they'll be like

01:08:27.099 --> 01:08:28.989
we have a map fight you for it yeah

01:08:28.989 --> 01:08:30.219
fight you for this beach they're like

01:08:30.219 --> 01:08:31.869
dude [ __ ] off is our it's [ __ ] insane

01:08:31.869 --> 01:08:35.770
oh yeah they'll do what they did last

01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:39.609
time which is like split the baby well

01:08:39.609 --> 01:08:41.080
China won't China I don't think China

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.670
[ __ ] only only China's backing down

01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:44.589
dude India and Pakistan just did this

01:08:44.589 --> 01:08:46.150
where they like killed each other a

01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:48.909
little bit so then I think India bombed

01:08:48.909 --> 01:08:52.210
like a Pakistani base yeah Pakistan knew

01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:52.810
was coming

01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:54.369
secretly so they just didn't have any

01:08:54.369 --> 01:08:56.469
troops in it so then the Indian papers

01:08:56.469 --> 01:08:57.940
could be like it we [ __ ] blew up on

01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:00.130
the basis for it call it even and then

01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:02.219
the Pakistanis could be like no one died

01:09:02.219 --> 01:09:05.799
yeah they're people I do I wonder if

01:09:05.799 --> 01:09:07.480
they're catching up in terms of having

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.359
like the machinery of like like super

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.909
propaganda cuz you know up to us

01:09:12.909 --> 01:09:14.739

01:09:20.409 --> 01:09:21.190
to what they're doing

01:09:21.190 --> 01:09:22.869

01:09:22.869 --> 01:09:25.810
totally yeah we even propagandizing

01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:27.279

Communist Party but we need more Jews

01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:49.639

like no they always do in communist

01:11:02.449 --> 01:11:04.040
countries they love [ __ ] committees

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:09.530
yeah two chairs you'd have like four

01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:11.659
committee member type dudes who are like

01:11:11.659 --> 01:11:13.550

[Laughter]

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:24.710
nutty if I borrow your uh your pool

01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:29.810
skimmer now the deep one not the one

01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:31.790
looks like a lacrosse stick goalie stick

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:33.440
yeah that's pretty great and they were

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.230
kind of like hey this is stuff from mrs.

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:38.179
Mouse Tufts this is now era stuff that

01:11:38.179 --> 01:11:40.010
you know it's it worked hey say what you

01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:41.659
will about it but it's like dude what

01:11:41.659 --> 01:11:44.090
the [ __ ] is that gonna be a job now yeah

01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:46.699
just a resident like government spy that

01:11:46.699 --> 01:11:47.929
just kind of chosen your block what do

01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:50.560
you do it's like carpenter

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.750
maybe that is a job maybe we don't even

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:55.400
need that cuz we have twitter we get

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.050
guys like our own friends being like

01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:59.630
they said bad words again last week yeah

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:03.230
better make that public yeah maybe we

01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:04.580
don't need it maybe we already surveil

01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:06.469
ourselves if maybe we are brother

01:12:06.469 --> 01:12:08.989
true maybe we are big brother bro yeah

01:12:08.989 --> 01:12:10.909
that was what I was thinking about this

01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:13.340
week where it's like with all this so

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:15.800
this is this is a theory I'm working on

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.719
this is bigger than are you afraid of

01:12:17.719 --> 01:12:20.270
the dark sugar fire so basically you

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:22.340
know I mean again I don't know it's not

01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.510
complete so obviously you know I'm

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:25.130
probably need another 25 years yes

01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:26.719
but it's like the general condition

01:12:26.719 --> 01:12:29.989
encourages false self big-time it's like

01:12:29.989 --> 01:12:31.969
to have what you in order to be like

01:12:31.969 --> 01:12:33.080
this is how I really feel about things

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.210
that's not happening is it's very risky

01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:36.860
but in order to connect with another

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.690
human being you have to honestly relate

01:12:38.690 --> 01:12:40.070
to them otherwise if you're just all

01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:41.989
your connections are based on like you

01:12:41.989 --> 01:12:44.060
kind of lying or like not being totally

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.920
honest yeah it's not like a real human

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.360
connection which people I think at the

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.250
end of the day are after more than

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:51.050
anything so it's like you know we're

01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:52.639
living in a thing that doesn't allow

01:12:52.639 --> 01:12:54.619
people to authentically connect really

01:12:54.619 --> 01:12:56.000
unless they're united under someone

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.940
weird like ideology yeah so that's like

01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:00.650
I think that's painting that's gonna do

01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:02.719
some bad stuff I thanked people yeah

01:13:02.719 --> 01:13:04.969
it's like a guy that's fair that's good

01:13:04.969 --> 01:13:06.800
if all your relationships are based on

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.099
like you know like yeah yeah exactly

01:13:10.099 --> 01:13:13.550
it's like there's no in think is that in

01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:15.440
order for P that's why I think for me

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.760
for a long time too it's like I think

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.980
people will accept extreme achievers try

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.230
to the whole idea is they lacked a

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.030
certain aspect of connection and then

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:24.889
they try to be like well if I could if I

01:13:24.889 --> 01:13:26.480
was this thing and then I could dictate

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.250
terms of a connection where like I

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:30.199
wouldn't feel so insecure so I'm like

01:13:30.199 --> 01:13:32.000
surrounded by titles and stuff so it's

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.710
like you you live your whole life to set

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:35.060
all your human relations up or you're

01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:37.280
like now they like me and so you know so

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.719
it's like but if you just honestly

01:13:38.719 --> 01:13:39.800
relate things you can connect without

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.690
doing all that stuff but you know either

01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:43.400
way sorry that's my allowed to really

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.560
honest both because of social risk II

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.330
dude now to be honest like that no

01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:50.239
you're not like for example just in the

01:13:50.239 --> 01:13:52.570
last couple weeks on social media like

01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:55.610
during everybody you [ __ ] better post

01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:58.280
a black square yeah or your silence is

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.380
consent it's murder no it's murder yeah

01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:02.719
and it's like well hold on maybe I think

01:14:02.719 --> 01:14:05.869
it's corny you know yeah there's there's

01:14:05.869 --> 01:14:07.219
that peer pressure it's like I have to

01:14:07.219 --> 01:14:10.099
say something yeah you know and then or

01:14:10.099 --> 01:14:11.840
or you're in trouble and you can't say

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.179
anything [ __ ] against it regardless

01:14:14.179 --> 01:14:16.699
yeah or you're in [ __ ] trouble so no

01:14:16.699 --> 01:14:18.230
one's allowed to see and then it's like

01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:21.080
even the [ __ ] D'Elia thing it's like

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.969
look I'm not [ __ ] defending him

01:14:22.969 --> 01:14:25.460
because I don't know anything but the

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.619
mob mentality of just crucifying anybody

01:14:27.619 --> 01:14:30.250
in three hours

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:32.330
you know that's [ __ ] up and if you

01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:33.889
speak up and say that people are like

01:14:33.889 --> 01:14:35.630
who the [ __ ] yeah and then you're just

01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:37.010
you're next yeah so people are just

01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:39.020
afraid to even well that's how

01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:40.400
[ __ ] where we should all be like hey

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.620
maybe these [ __ ] you know mmm

01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:45.590
kangaroo courts are a little yeah I'd

01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:48.080
say yeah well I would I would I think

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.910
right we should just do full internet

01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:51.410
search history just get it out let's

01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:52.820
let's put the chips on the table all

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:54.470
texts all internet search history and

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:55.850
let's fight let's just let it rip dude

01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:58.910
if people are like I'm cool in that it's

01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:00.500
like ah well then [ __ ] relax yeah

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.420
true oh but he who cast the first

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:04.190
browser history dude throws the first

01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:07.970
[ __ ] it's true let me see all you let me

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:09.440
listen to all your phone calls all your

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.360
[ __ ] things yeah then well you know

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.890
it was it was funny to see people be

01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:15.380
like like people defending daliyah and

I'm sorry to cut you off no that's the

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:15.680
whole point it does remind me of this

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:18.260
really funny it was this black dude in

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:20.120
front of like all of it which this was

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.890
kind of odd it was a bunch of like

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:24.740
nurses and doctors out yeah protesting

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:26.270
in front of hospital about black lives

01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:27.620
matter they're holding up a sign they

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:29.450
weren't getting attention this week only

01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:31.850
doctors and nurses so nobody huh nobody

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:35.000

uh and the occasional is plenty muffled

01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:44.180
so they all indeed black lives matter

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:45.680
signs I believe it was a black dude it

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.540
sounded like black and he drove by and

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:49.550

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:52.160
they're like yeah he was like what about

the victims of black on black crime and

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:56.270
they're like yeah of course and then one

01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:58.190
one nurse like walked out to like taking

01:19:58.190 --> 01:19:59.960

silent like wait those lives don't

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:20.240

nothing better dude black conservatives

01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:35.380

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:40.250
kryptonite you want to slam the Lord but

01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:47.690
they can just kind of like it was a that

01:20:47.690 --> 01:20:48.680
was we talking about before when I

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:51.080
watched a teacher bring up the Dwyane

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.360
Wade son and someone was like I will get

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.770
that [ __ ] some [ __ ] man he'll

01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:56.240
straighten his ass out and the late the

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.980
teachers all like the black lady said

01:20:57.980 --> 01:20:59.000
this and all the white teachers were

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.150
like yeah I mean that's a that's a

01:21:02.150 --> 01:21:03.920
cultural way to look good that's crazy

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.750
that's and then one lady was like I

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:09.190
don't think I don't know just totally

01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:11.900
yeah fries they got the gloves on i loud

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.490
that's been that's been one of my more

01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:16.610
favorite things about this whole ongoing

01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:17.840
thing i think the protest itself is

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:18.780
because now

01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:20.579
slipping into trans black lives matter

01:21:20.579 --> 01:21:22.889
and just seeing by people that were

01:21:22.889 --> 01:21:30.360
protesting like that's is that us now

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.400
what's going on yeah you're marching for

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.460
trans which is you should yeah you

01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:35.849
should

01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:37.559
so things but then was there was a real

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.389
any like real pushback that was like all

01:21:39.389 --> 01:21:41.789
black lives matter well yeah then you

01:21:41.789 --> 01:21:43.050
started to get into it I know that's

01:21:43.050 --> 01:21:44.400
like a trouble with that I don't know

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.739
it's a troll or what well I mean once

01:21:46.739 --> 01:21:48.119
you break it down to a subset yeah

01:21:48.119 --> 01:21:49.320
that's what happens but it sounds like

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.460
you and me are defending all lives

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:50.849
matter

01:21:50.849 --> 01:21:52.530
no we're just pointing out the fact that

01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:54.059
it's funny when black lives matter gets

01:21:54.059 --> 01:21:55.440
broken down into black trans lives

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.500
mattered a lot of people like all black

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.639
eyes yeah trans are more at risk than

01:22:02.639 --> 01:22:08.610
you trail yeah that no that is a again I

01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:09.989
would be curious to see how that was

01:22:09.989 --> 01:22:11.340
received if it was like no doubt no

01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:11.840
doubt

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.920
cuz you can just be like yeah for sure

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.989
say no down because you can say like no

01:22:15.989 --> 01:22:17.639
doubt being like rather than being like

01:22:17.639 --> 01:22:19.409
because the whole thing when they're

01:22:19.409 --> 01:22:21.000
like black lives matter people like Oh

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.610
diggity no doubt you know they're like

01:22:23.610 --> 01:22:24.989
all lives matter all we can do is beg

01:22:24.989 --> 01:22:27.239
yeah no that's for sure yeah I don't

01:22:27.239 --> 01:22:28.980
like well what's that mean that I don't

01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:31.289
it's like yeah it's just when someone's

01:22:31.289 --> 01:22:33.960
arguing it yeah it's like it's also sick

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:35.190
to to be like if you're sitting there

01:22:35.190 --> 01:22:36.480
you're on your own social media see

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.079
black lives matter you like [ __ ]

01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:42.090
it's gotta be a [ __ ] loophole there's

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:43.679
gotta be a weakness in this position

01:22:43.679 --> 01:22:48.449
you're like all ass matter stuff that

01:22:48.449 --> 01:22:48.869
was easy

01:22:48.869 --> 01:22:53.250
this can't be disputed there's no way

01:22:53.250 --> 01:22:55.829
this is wrong yeah man that anti racism

01:22:55.829 --> 01:22:57.530
is going to be like the pro-life

01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:59.579
pro-choice type thing where it's just

01:22:59.579 --> 01:23:01.969
like I'm anti racist like I'm pro-life

01:23:01.969 --> 01:23:03.690
there you like death

01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:05.010

01:23:14.010 --> 01:23:16.260
black day I'm like yes mom I know it's

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:17.699
for that's why that's what it started

01:23:17.699 --> 01:23:19.949
out as bill for so it started out is

01:23:19.949 --> 01:23:24.960
that's no good that's junk lemare that

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.770
didn't sound great

01:23:25.770 --> 01:23:28.889
no sound bad a lot of happen I apologize

01:23:28.889 --> 01:23:31.570
for using my Delia power against you

01:23:31.570 --> 01:23:33.250
I do have deleted esque powers in this

01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:35.020
studio you hold them over you and I

01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:40.420
apologize trail oh yeah man that's the

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.480
state of things today Cove it is Cove it

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:46.530
might not be real doctors are very

01:23:46.530 --> 01:23:49.390
monetary [ __ ] hey long doctors

01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:51.070
I'm gonna [ __ ] that I'm next time I

01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.910
go to the doctor again I don't have

01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:53.110
health insurance right now so might be I

01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:55.360
want it which is funny because we never

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.890
really complain about the health care

01:23:56.890 --> 01:23:59.140
system mm-hmm probably should neither

01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:02.500
what's up hey I'm 32 definitely gives me

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.450
his declining health flex shortly yeah

01:24:04.450 --> 01:24:05.950
myself jump off I got a start like

01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:07.270
complaining about health care because

01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:08.590
that is a little crazy yeah that's a

01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:09.820
[ __ ] you should have health care I

01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:11.620
would say we should ever thought about

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:12.790
this is my theory about that today I

01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:14.650
just came up with that you know feels

01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:15.490
like it doesn't England have a

01:24:15.490 --> 01:24:17.470
single-payer system Canada France

01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:19.600
everybody all these countries that are

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.670
military more or less kind of pays for

01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:24.220
pays for and protect those boys I think

01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:26.950
we purposely are left to not have health

01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:29.380
care to encourage enlistment in the

01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.660
military because I think if they were to

01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:33.130
give everybody health care it's like

01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:35.230
that like $20,000 signing bonus and like

01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:37.600
killer benefits it's like [ __ ] that

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:40.720
already have that so I I think since

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.310
we're like world military they don't

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:44.410
give us health care to encourage more

01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:45.490
and more people to sign up for the

01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:47.350
mericans are basically Spartans that's

01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:48.610
what I'm saying that's great we're all

01:24:48.610 --> 01:24:52.710
Jack dudes with that or fat or all fat

01:24:53.010 --> 01:24:55.300
America's fattest fat part is just at

01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.010
home watching cuz there's no reason do

01:24:57.010 --> 01:24:58.780
we have so much [ __ ] money I gotta

01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:08.560
run across like foam we are pretty much

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.600
America is fat sparse fat Sparta dude

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.670
that's we love no that's great that's

01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:15.460
the thing that's the Canadians dude I

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:20.140
got into a boil of this I started

01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:21.760
thinking of a game called Greek twist or

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.380
the other day where it's like so you

01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:24.610
would say we were playing Greek twist I

01:25:24.610 --> 01:25:25.870
was thinking about how supple after my

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:27.250
parents call me fat I was like trying to

01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:28.690
compare in my head in the shower like

01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:31.030
I'm more supple dude I'm more fun I'm

01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:33.430
more just like you know my body flows

01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:35.740
dude for sure very it is very Greek it's

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:37.120
like a Greek statue it's not like rip

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.560
really they could tell there's muscle

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.310
underneath there there's small dick

01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:43.590
the tiny dick like not a totally

01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:45.150
well-defined six-pack and not like huge

01:25:45.150 --> 01:25:46.890
pecs but like you know it's definitely

01:25:46.890 --> 01:25:48.270
tell the guy strongest [ __ ] from the

01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:50.670
statue who's in fat ass who's

01:25:50.670 --> 01:25:52.560
intelligent exactly do you can't be like

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.990
yoked and people see you and be like oh

01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:56.040
that guy's smart although that would be

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.440
slightly soft hey that's what I'm saying

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.570

01:26:00.570 --> 01:26:04.040
yeah I have IQ fat on my body but yeah

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.970
remember the [ __ ] I was talking about

01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:07.380
Oh greek twister so i started thinking

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:09.720
about like just a good thing for people

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.480
to play so just two dudes get naked and

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.280
compare the strength kind of like you

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:15.630
and fellow arm wrestled the other day oh

01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:17.130
yeah we didn't talk yeah I forgot about

01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:19.260
you guys you get totally naked and then

01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:20.610
like so you and I'd be naked like you

01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:21.900
put it like a bed or in the grass and

01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:23.070
then regardless see whose wrist is

01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:24.270
stronger than whose wrist and it's like

01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:26.220
you do wrist power and they're all right

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:27.570
let's do wrist while we do ankles it's

01:26:27.570 --> 01:26:28.530
Greek twister and then you have to

01:26:28.530 --> 01:26:30.060
constantly combat different body parts

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:36.930
to see who can overpower who's how do

01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:38.250
you get to donk

01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:39.870
dude these are I mean you thought of

01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:41.340
dumb obviously no I didn't I didn't you

01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.840
didn't think of one no this is it this

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.480
is just a classic contest of strength

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.760
dude in the spirit of old-school

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:48.930
bodybuilding which obviously you're

01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:50.070
gonna be making for this in greco-roman

01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:51.960

01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:56.220
get ideas before I fall asleep and this

01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.080
was one that I was like Greek twister

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:02.460
hilarious cause you'd spin the dial on a

01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:04.560
big hand feet and you have to just like

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.060
instead of like touching the square you

01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.680
see whose hand or feet is stronger than

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.420
the other person so you have to D say

01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:10.710
you don't be naked for this honestly you

01:27:10.710 --> 01:27:15.120

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:16.199
him but he went with elder abuse just

01:28:16.199 --> 01:28:17.790

getting you into loving people

01:29:00.090 --> 01:29:01.920

also say Western aid they said Western

01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.870
Asia also had also I might have been I

01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:46.190
might be descended from white slaves and

01:46:46.190 --> 01:46:47.570
the Barbary States dude but your [ __ ]

01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:49.660
tongue no no no I might have been home

01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:53.000
Adam it's white one of them says

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.490
ancestor calm says in North Africa 1%

01:46:55.490 --> 01:46:56.930
the other one gonna be bummed out West

01:46:56.930 --> 01:46:58.910
Asian turns out Native Americans had

01:46:58.910 --> 01:47:02.060
them pass slaves big time not black I'm

01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:05.150
sure they obviously never had Native

01:47:05.150 --> 01:47:07.070
Americans had them yeah yeah they had

01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:09.110
why I didn't this is this is and the

01:47:09.110 --> 01:47:11.710
white man's reparations was uh you know

01:47:11.710 --> 01:47:14.690
five hundred seventy eight million acres

01:47:14.690 --> 01:47:17.830
and a mule

01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:21.560
Cassini's yeah yeah they got like I'm in

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:22.910
the white man's reparations to the

01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:25.790
Native Americans enslavement oh so they

01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:28.610
had White's reparations was the United

01:47:28.610 --> 01:47:30.830
see entire United States here why do you

01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:34.000
call it even

01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:38.500
no your North African bloodlines

01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:40.690
definitely Barbary pirates that had them

01:47:40.690 --> 01:47:42.070
I mean if you're gonna call me a pirate

01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:43.900
it's like did you if you could

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:45.969
technically have pirate blood but also

01:47:45.969 --> 01:47:47.530
I've had them like what are you doing

01:47:47.530 --> 01:47:48.880
what are you taking because if you're

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:50.380
not it then you're not having pirates

01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:51.670
didn't have slaves they just made people

01:47:51.670 --> 01:47:54.190
pirates with them so my defense my

01:47:54.190 --> 01:47:58.119
entire con my fin might have had I just

01:47:58.119 --> 01:47:59.830
made people but other pirates - it's

01:47:59.830 --> 01:48:01.270
like Captain Hook my head you say your

01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:06.730
people you know you're gonna grant me

01:48:06.730 --> 01:48:08.170
pirate blood which is all of a sudden to

01:48:08.170 --> 01:48:09.310
make sense while I was attracted to this

01:48:09.310 --> 01:48:12.580
flag it's just my culture I don't think

01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:14.110
if I had a guess I mean I don't know

01:48:14.110 --> 01:48:15.760
much about the Barbie why I immediately

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:19.119
detested it probably in the column in

01:48:19.119 --> 01:48:20.800
the the village of Baltimore Ireland

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:22.719
you're a white slave got taken by the

01:48:22.719 --> 01:48:25.030
Pirates barbarous [ __ ] shitty pirate

01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:28.810
realm it's either that or its West Asian

01:48:28.810 --> 01:48:29.830
which I don't even know what that is

01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:33.460
that's Middle East okay swag so I'm like

01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:41.380
that's what's up [ __ ] whites that

01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:46.780
could easily be me man yeah your people

01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:49.750
were yeah see you're half I mean it

01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:51.610
makes sense I naturally have habitated

01:48:51.610 --> 01:48:53.770
towards the skull The Buccaneer symbol

01:48:53.770 --> 01:48:59.889
do you know Buccaneers go ahead this is

01:48:59.889 --> 01:49:02.739
my big Snapple yes I was gonna save that

01:49:02.739 --> 01:49:05.920
for the [ __ ] back doc ah try it over

01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:09.040
here bukhan means food and the

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:11.139
Buccaneers used to sell wow that's close

01:49:11.139 --> 01:49:13.869
and they Buccaneers used to rape people

01:49:13.869 --> 01:49:15.820
and self no it was Richard well I'm sure

01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:17.110
how you're tell me pirates weren't rated

01:49:17.110 --> 01:49:18.280
by him but that has nothing to with the

01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:19.750
tires weren't even not raping they were

01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:21.489
they had like yeah they were like

01:49:21.489 --> 01:49:23.110
animals when it comes to sex yeah they

01:49:23.110 --> 01:49:24.820
had like whole you know sections just

01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:27.190
you don't accuse otters or you know yeah

01:49:27.190 --> 01:49:28.929
you wouldn't see like a dog's [ __ ]

01:49:28.929 --> 01:49:30.790
abhi I mean that dogs a rapist trail

01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:32.350
same way but like if Pirates are [ __ ]

01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:34.540
yeah I mean I this part of the program

01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:36.250
you know they had peg boy that's what

01:49:36.250 --> 01:49:38.409
peg boys come from yeah they would have

01:49:38.409 --> 01:49:40.210
little boys that would have this fact I

01:49:40.210 --> 01:49:41.770
should have counted a stick up there but

01:49:41.770 --> 01:49:44.290
yeah so they they didn't like not just

01:49:44.290 --> 01:49:45.940
rape eligible hey

01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:48.190
- they had I mean sex slaves basically

01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:50.230
yeah but yeah that was that was no the

01:49:50.230 --> 01:49:51.670
Pirates I descend from which is all

01:49:51.670 --> 01:49:53.710
about treasure adventure it was like

01:49:53.710 --> 01:49:55.840
Johnny Depp basically it's my ancestry

01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:59.949
except they had him John had a little

01:49:59.949 --> 01:50:01.300
mean to his wife but didn't have him he

01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:04.840
wasn't false true Stanhope false exactly

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.810
Stan oh yeah me too it stood by his man

01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:09.460
on that he did these theorems a loyal

01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:13.750
dog Buccaneers found this out what is it

01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:17.110
so the Spanish owned most of Haiti they

01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:18.910
owned Haiti they got out of there when

01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:20.640
they found out there was gold and

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:23.350
Mainland like in like South America they

01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:25.030
were more focused on that yeah in comes

01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:27.580
from French and British pirates come to

01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:29.260
this land that used to be inhabited by

01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:31.180
Spanish so there's cattle roam around

01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:33.280
wild cattle so the way they made money

01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:35.370
these pirates they would shoot and kill

01:50:35.370 --> 01:50:38.949
wild cattle smoke the meat sell it right

01:50:38.949 --> 01:50:41.500
the smoked meat is known as bukhan there

01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:42.730
you go so everybody just start calling

01:50:42.730 --> 01:50:45.699
Buccaneers how about that now you

01:50:45.699 --> 01:50:47.110
learned something so they were pirates

01:50:47.110 --> 01:50:49.060
but they resorted to selling smoked meat

01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:51.160
yeah while they were yeah [ __ ] that's

01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:52.900
a better life than being a shitty pirate

01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:55.150
then boarding somebody ship on a rope

01:50:55.150 --> 01:50:56.469
still do that that's still people's

01:50:56.469 --> 01:50:58.330
lives they're just pirates here beef

01:50:58.330 --> 01:51:00.460
jerky so I'm here if you're a thief in

01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:03.520
water you're a pirate or or just like an

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:06.699
absolute master true either way yeah I

01:51:06.699 --> 01:51:07.989
guess if you take well I guess pirates

01:51:07.989 --> 01:51:09.580
aren't just these so if you're a pirate

01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:12.340
it's like it's a full smash-and-grab

01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:15.030
24/7 you're like a murderer thief

01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:18.730
pirates priests liar I'd assume very

01:51:18.730 --> 01:51:22.900
honorable but yeah you people had them

01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:26.020
be so glad that my ancestry is filled

01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:29.440
with only people that were right now so

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:33.160

mindfulness how [ __ ] chill is I the

01:52:13.419 --> 01:52:14.619
whole time when I found out the sound

01:52:14.619 --> 01:52:16.719
was missing I was just like I was like

01:52:16.719 --> 01:52:18.489

01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:24.489
without almost fuming and working as

01:52:24.489 --> 01:52:27.989
hard as not to bend a fourth no I

01:52:27.989 --> 01:52:31.570

to do it wasn't even like it just it

01:52:37.329 --> 01:52:38.949
wasn't free I'm saying bad just wasn't

01:52:38.949 --> 01:52:40.929
[ __ ] it wasn't funny I didn't have fun

01:52:40.929 --> 01:52:43.719

01:52:46.269 --> 01:52:47.739
yeah I kind of hit all the main points

01:52:47.739 --> 01:52:50.139
today yeah we'd cover it just [ __ ]

01:52:50.139 --> 01:52:52.089
that's probably what we should do is

01:52:52.089 --> 01:52:55.269
usually record one yeah I got [ __ ] we

01:52:55.269 --> 01:52:56.379
