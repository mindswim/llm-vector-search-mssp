Title: Tybalt's Hole
Description: In this episode we see the horrible butthole of Shane's Cat. Subjects also include: Shane on the peloton, The inter-generational trap of Walmart brain/body, The first Troop, and both of our current domestic conflicts.

Also, this should hopefully be the last of our Zoom Chronicles, as the studio should be finished by next week Lord willing.

is yeah man dude I I was telling Billy

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.170
today I'm like I just again I can't

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.510
understand if the president's such an

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:35.490
important job how is it that if you're

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.740
trying to take down Trump how is it that

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.480
Joe Biden if this is a job that actually

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.670
matters where in the world where you're

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.080
like all right we need a stuttering guy

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.730
with a long history of sexual

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.070
impropriety it's like if it's that

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.660
important of a job you can't find like

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.280
that dude couldn't be the CEO of Apple

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.890
these people are now of course so it's

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.080
like you're telling yeah I mean in their

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.820
defense either could Trump make no

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.830
exactly but it's like same thing it's

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.510
like if it's such an important job we're

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.250
supposed to say like you know you better

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.390
get in there and pick the right person

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.890
and push the button and change the world

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.890
if that's true why the [ __ ] is it

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.110
between those two people like I just

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.060
don't believe that it's a real thing

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.440
when people are like get in there and do

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.690
your part it's like I don't think that

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.760
if you could truly change the world by

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.470
pushing a bit just it's not the way it

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.830
works yeah to be like no I agree

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.680
everything's hard but there's just one

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.300
thing and it's basically what controls

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.830
everything if you push the right button

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.970
you win oh yeah I don't know man it was

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.290
just funny thinking like that's their

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.080
that's their hope a stuttering possible

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.370
rabies but obviously definitely not

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:39.450
because you know he didn't do it

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.190
obviously you know totally fabricated

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.500
but also believe all women hashtag yes

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.450
to me it's just funny it's funny to

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.760
watch me like that's the guy these

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.190
people couldn't run a [ __ ] car

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:55.580
dealership Trump would run a [ __ ]

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.970
medal he gets laying that I'm sure I

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.070
would run a dealership and then just get

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.600
destroyed by the IRS

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.360

down wait how old were the victims

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.640
usually 80 years old with pre-existing

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:48.590
conditions oh shut it down we need

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.650
college football this year shut it down

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:55.640
now or is it it's it's in New York well

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.550
it's in it's on HBO now and I think it's

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.100
like recommended on HBO right now which

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.410
is like it's just fear inducing yeah

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.110
it's like a movie that's like this is

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.030
what not to not to be [ __ ]

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:11.270
conspiratorial or [ __ ] anti left or

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.740
whatever but it's literally the left's

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.720
like what dream of what kovat could have

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.420
been where it's just like they're

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.810
digging [ __ ] mass graves outside of

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.570
cities to fill with like yeah this is a

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:25.720
worst-case scenario across the board

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.010
it's very it's a good movie though it's

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.490
[ __ ] cool and at the very end

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:32.499
they show you how the disease started

00:26:32.499 --> 00:26:35.590
and it's a [ __ ] bat in Asia

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.419
he's munching some food and then he

00:26:37.419 --> 00:26:39.879
flies into a [ __ ] market or a

00:26:39.879 --> 00:26:42.549
slaughterhouse drops his food a pig eats

00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:44.710
it and then the pig gets slaughtered and

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.590
that's how he started yeah I mean they

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:50.769
nailed there like it was covered see how

00:26:50.769 --> 00:26:53.740
the covered started holy [ __ ] man yeah

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.369
it's pretty wild it is funny HBO's like

00:26:57.369 --> 00:26:59.499
check it out yeah HBO's like hey

00:26:59.499 --> 00:27:01.119
everybody we know you're paranoid and

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:03.129
locked inside and probably scared of

00:27:03.129 --> 00:27:05.379
what's going on here's you know the

00:27:05.379 --> 00:27:06.700
scariest thing that could have happened

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.710
here's your worst nightmare here's two

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.529
hours of night that'd be like I mean

00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:13.360
honestly that's like being on a plane

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.529
and them being like alright we're

00:27:14.529 --> 00:27:18.730
watching final destination oh yeah why

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.700
you're like no turn this off watching

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.929
like what was the movie with Denzel when

00:27:22.929 --> 00:27:27.220
he does coke and drives a plane we watch

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.580
this train wheels training day - I'm a

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.519
pilot now yeah he just needs coke to be

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:35.320
good actually

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.889
great what movie movies good yeah rolled

00:27:38.889 --> 00:27:43.330
a [ __ ] giant plane blew it upside

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:51.369
down like a rocky like no no one else

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:52.779
could have done this it's like well you

00:27:52.779 --> 00:27:54.759
probably didn't he - everyone was like

00:27:54.759 --> 00:27:57.279
no he had to I don't know I don't know

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:59.830
anything about planes but doing a barrel

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.309
roll for no reason - a barrel roll dude

00:28:02.309 --> 00:28:04.659
who's on coke and saw that [ __ ]

00:28:04.659 --> 00:28:14.499
rabbit from Star Fox - did you uh have

00:28:14.499 --> 00:28:16.389
you so it was funny as you're saying

00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:17.889
that and I was watching I was reading a

00:28:17.889 --> 00:28:21.249
news whatever was the Atlantic's whole

00:28:21.249 --> 00:28:23.289
month is about conspiracy theories right

00:28:23.289 --> 00:28:26.799
now or they're saying like cute like Q's

00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:29.019
the big one there like Q's coming out

00:28:29.019 --> 00:28:30.850
and it's there their whole thesis is

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.639
more or less that like Hugh now is it's

00:28:33.639 --> 00:28:35.379
like don't even worry about conspiracy

00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:37.659
theories this is a religion now and it's

00:28:37.659 --> 00:28:40.179
a religion hell-bent on like it'll just

00:28:40.179 --> 00:28:41.799
end up in like domestic terrorism and

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:43.240
people killing each other and bobble of

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.170
what

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:46.750
I do agree that it probably will result

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.200
in a lot of domestic terrorism I think

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.299
it will now that doesn't mean it won't

00:28:52.299 --> 00:28:53.980
result yeah I think there will be a

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.450
couple of incidents well there have

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:56.920
there have been there have been guys it

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.020
won't the guy you know again this is

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.610
when you get in the conspiracy realm

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:02.049
everything it's a kind of quicksand so

00:29:02.049 --> 00:29:03.940
it's like yeah the guy who attacked

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.710
common ping-pong apparently he they

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.700
according to this they came out and

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.950
we're like he was a good Christian man

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.690
who just really thought there was a

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.070
bunch of kids in there he went in there

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.320
to free him and it was there you open

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.730
the door it's all there's no kids he was

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:20.260
like uh I think they said there's not

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.270
even a basement there he was just like

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:25.000
I'm so sorry I thought it was kids in

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.620
here and I thought I had to save them

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.059
you know God told me to save these kids

00:29:28.059 --> 00:29:30.520
and yeah well I guess I'll stay off the

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.530
internet now and they kind of think he

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.780
they kind of like petition there is

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.220
community now it was like he's a good

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.600
guy dude he just thought there was

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.100
[ __ ] sex slaves in a piece of place

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.230
and then there's people saying like he

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.290
like you know he was fun sent there but

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.559
yeah man it is the Atlantic's thing is

00:29:47.559 --> 00:29:49.090
funny cuz they're just like this is an

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.010
ideology this is a religion this is this

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.750
there's two big things there's that and

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.200
then there's like don't like we're gonna

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.240
die if globalization fails we're gonna

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.950
die they're like oh you think we're

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:01.630
gonna become self-sustaining democracies

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.970
will die if globalization fails and it's

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:07.090
like alright I hope not hope this is my

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.340
822 cuz I have I'm like alright as long

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.600
as there's dude I was taught it was

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.500
funny as I was talking to a guy

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.900
yesterday who's like from the military

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.220
travels like he was going like Zimbabwe

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.190
all these places he's like dude the fact

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.480
that they try to get us fired up like

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.549
our shits [ __ ] up he was like go to a

00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:23.980
supermarket in Zimbabwe the price of

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.720
bread will double before you go check

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.780
out like literally there said there's

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.429
tickets he's like there's tickets in

00:30:30.429 --> 00:30:32.440
there where you go and you grab a ticket

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.760
and if you get that ticket you get the

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.260
price at that time that you entered so

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.600
it's like little kids go early and pull

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.250
the tickets and sell you tickets for a

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.169
dollar so you can get there early prices

00:30:41.169 --> 00:30:43.000
when you can ice all the time you leave

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.410
the price of bread is art it's like

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.790
there's a real-time ticker on all the

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.260
goods because everything's inflating so

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:52.390
high you dude it was yeah yeah other

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.630
countries are trashed dude like Trey I

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.789
was even in Spain I was like Spain [ __ ]

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:01.090
instincts means it's not and Spain's

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:03.700
like elite it's out there yeah it's out

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.279
there Spain's the western country and it

00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:09.580
still sucked yeah I mean I'm sure look

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.109
it had a lot of [ __ ] cool things

00:31:11.109 --> 00:31:12.970
going on sure but if you wanted to do

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:16.869
something like business-wise you were

00:31:16.869 --> 00:31:18.629
[ __ ] like I you couldn't go to a bank

00:31:18.629 --> 00:31:21.669
banks would just be closed at random

00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:24.809
times [ __ ] were closed at 3:00 today

00:31:24.809 --> 00:31:28.989
why go nine to five just be 9:00 to 5:00

00:31:28.989 --> 00:31:31.629
they couldn't take it literally couldn't

00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:35.919
this dude was saying there was a candy

00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:38.259
shop there was nice things in my town

00:31:38.259 --> 00:31:40.720
there was like it was like living in a

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.119
different time okay like go down good go

00:31:43.119 --> 00:31:45.580
to the soda fountain get some there's a

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.259
soda store you can get a coke

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:50.470
[ __ ] that [ __ ] yeah it's off a school it

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.059
is it is funny though for people to

00:31:52.059 --> 00:31:53.379
stoke people in it like dude we're

00:31:53.379 --> 00:31:54.789
[ __ ] we're gonna die it's like dude

00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:57.309
even if we when even we crash out yeah

00:31:57.309 --> 00:31:59.889
sucks big time but it's like again you

00:31:59.889 --> 00:32:02.259
know we'll be fine everyone will be okay

00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:04.029
it's just you know it's [ __ ] a blows

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.950
dudes with no boxers just dong

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:01.640
everywhere ya see the dong moved through

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.740
like the curtains backstage it looks

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.690
like somebody in the when dudes with

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:09.950
huge dicks are just in their underwear

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:11.120
and they're like walking it looks like

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.520
somebody that can't figure out where the

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.790
opening to a curtain is so you trap your

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:20.330
dog under a blanket he said he was like

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:21.679

00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:36.679

was a troop in Philadelphia that

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.000
predates the country if that makes sense

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.550
the colonies are the American colonies

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.290

Indian War mmm just [ __ ] beast but it

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.799

00:35:51.799 --> 00:35:55.869
about like America back then and it's

00:35:55.869 --> 00:35:58.670
dude when you think about I know this is

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.829
like this is like a STONER thought about

00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:05.000
like history but like how recent like

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.279
you were talking about those roads

00:36:06.279 --> 00:36:09.950
Zimbabwe like dude our country people

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:12.529
were not here and we have like the

00:36:12.529 --> 00:36:15.740
amount of infrastructure in all the [ __ ]

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.539
we've done to this huge continent is

00:36:17.539 --> 00:36:19.339
[ __ ] insane in the amount of time

00:36:19.339 --> 00:36:22.640
we've done it like it's crazy yeah like

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.720
if you think about like as long as

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.720
you've been alive from like this is how

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.720
like quickly history goes it's like from

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.650
your birth until right now was basically

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.990
the same distances your birth to World

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:41.180
War two what do you know I mean all

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.210
right so like from right now to 1980 is

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:46.640
the same amount of time as from 1982

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.940
World War two Oh like it's very it's

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.160
it's very it's a lot shorter than you

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.920
[ __ ] think so when you hear it alike

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:58.930
yes when you think back to like you know

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:03.230
1750 it's really not that long ago it's

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.059
very weird it's very weird to think how

00:37:05.059 --> 00:37:05.869
far we've come

00:37:05.869 --> 00:37:09.200
dude they were uh that's history guys he

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.480
was showing us pictures of when in

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.099
Philadelphia when this thing was started

00:37:13.099 --> 00:37:15.079
it was just like this big castle and

00:37:15.079 --> 00:37:17.000
then there was just land everywhere that

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.260
went all the way to the Delaware River

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.430
and it was just like you show us

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:20.690
pictures I was like what the [ __ ] dude

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.630
yeah that's crazy it was in that Thomas

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.309
Marr book there's like maps of New York

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:27.470
from back then it was just like north of

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:31.730
50th Street was just farm yeah in 1860

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.680
god that must mean sick as you get [ __ ]

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.950
back then

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.839
put that been terrible gettin [ __ ] back

00:37:36.839 --> 00:37:39.000
then also we talkin that I mean it's

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.619
still [ __ ] great but it was definitely

00:37:40.619 --> 00:37:44.279
like disgusting I don't know man I mean

00:37:44.279 --> 00:37:45.779
I guess you know I'm not gonna compare

00:37:45.779 --> 00:37:47.400
myself to somebody living in like the

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.799
1700 in New York but like it's funny the

00:37:49.799 --> 00:37:51.059
reason I'm even comparing no air

00:37:51.059 --> 00:37:53.940
conditioning no air conditioning rarely

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.579
the showered no pointless no porn no

00:37:56.579 --> 00:37:58.349
porn ya know don't get me wrong it's

00:37:58.349 --> 00:38:00.269
gonna feel good and you're probably used

00:38:00.269 --> 00:38:03.450
to horrible smells but the ladies parts

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.750
are gonna be toxic well back then you

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.269

a stack with their eyes closed

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:20.029
I think if somebody was hit from behind

00:38:20.029 --> 00:38:23.099
just the butthole there's no toilet

00:38:23.099 --> 00:38:25.680

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.839
Tibble my cat now Bonin back then was

00:38:30.839 --> 00:38:32.339

00:38:32.339 --> 00:38:34.500
there was nobody out there like [ __ ] -

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.839

guys there's there I'm Tony there's

00:48:55.869 --> 00:48:59.800
people who are I think besieged by just

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.840
like you know if you wake up every day

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.310

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:04.720
see a commercial or like Cookie Crisp

00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:19.900
trapped into a level of like dumb and

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.880
fat that like is intergenerational like

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.770
in puddles drift family for generations

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:26.440
and it's like it sounds mean but it's

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.170
like if you know that that it's it's

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:30.820
it's the perfect intersection of dumb

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.380
and fat where you go to a Walmart and

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.090
someone's very dumb and very fat and

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:35.680
it's just a self repeating cycle or it's

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.720
like I'm so I don't think I was eating

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.700

like no fork well I don't think those I

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.830
swear to god there's no chance those

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:52.630
people are even remotely discussing

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:55.300
sugar or carbs they're walking around

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.180
with 32 ounce [ __ ] Mountain Dews

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.670

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:03.280
mountain dude that's the color they're

yeah it's it's you know that's gotta be

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.790
a [ __ ] I can't figure out if that's

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:27.250
actually a good life I'm trying to

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:29.200
figure out yeah I've wondered about it

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.820
man I think there is something kind of

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:31.930
nice about it it's almost like a

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.450
religious experience just to like go to

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:37.510
Walmart load up on like just like jumbo

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:40.930
sized boxes of cheetos and tons of tubs

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:43.000
of ice cream just only drink soda just

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.859
watch American Idol and be like oh man

00:50:44.859 --> 00:50:46.330
this guy's this kid's got a chance

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:49.840
instead of this guy's socks I feel like

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.640
if you were to fully give yourself over

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.220
to like

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:56.790
cable-tv sugar and alcohol you'd have a

00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:58.680
nice run I mean it's a it's definitely a

00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:59.340
profit

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:02.190
it is a crash-landing like my foot a

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:05.130
foot comes off literally yeah an oxygen

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:08.580
tank is installed it's as bad ending but

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.340
that run before it ends it's got a rule

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:14.400
being like totally obese just sitting

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.870
there watching [ __ ] just munching

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:18.360
anything you feel like just watching a

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:21.710
big on stop and just having zero

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:25.620
awareness of being like this like this

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.590
rules

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:29.820
I think it's awareness thing I think

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.620
there's people who that that's like like

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:33.330
when I remember so I have you know I

00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:35.400
have a bunch of stupid food allergies my

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.900
family made fun of me a family is like

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.040
what are you eating what are you doing

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.680
this so the there's got to be levels of

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.300
it where if you don't drink like three

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.060
Mountain Dews at dinner people are like

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:47.700
you think you know better than me what

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.470
are you drinking what is that they're

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:50.760
probably they probably can't drink water

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:54.210
I mean they do need bottles but what do

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:55.380
you mean when they say bottles like they

00:51:55.380 --> 00:52:00.000
need like a drink any bottled water most

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.220
these people are from fracking [ __ ]

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:06.900
Jones true water is flammable but look

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.540

[ __ ] on you about my bad

00:59:21.339 --> 00:59:23.500
Connor were there and the cameras we

00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.089
were at the news turd was basically it's

00:59:25.089 --> 00:59:27.700
like when a dog shits in a house it eats

00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:32.160
it well I'm not even matter

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.869
I don't have to clean it well the

00:59:33.869 --> 00:59:35.099
cameras I was like you have the only

00:59:35.099 --> 00:59:36.690
problem now is the cameras just kind of

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:38.160
recycle and turn on and often when I was

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.450
trying to run the program and he was

00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:41.299
like would you hit record I was like

00:59:41.299 --> 00:59:43.440
[ __ ] you deeds what do you think you're

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:44.910
a tech wizard we just didn't hit record

00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:46.680
so Connor left it on the ground

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.900
O'Connor's deterred I thought it was

00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:51.510
DoDEA start no Connor is fine too but be

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:53.280
me neocon over there and neither of us

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.900
thought to hit record on the cameras to

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.609
trigger the recording software on the

00:59:56.609 --> 00:59:59.039
switcher and it was just like god I'm

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:45.299
works at a dealership so Mimi's is on

01:05:45.299 --> 01:05:49.170
that car dealer life which is 12 hours a

01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:50.970
day and then you come home and go to

01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:54.599
sleep yeah that's another thing you're

01:05:54.599 --> 01:05:55.619
dealing with when you're buying a car

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:57.420
you're dealing with a dude whose life is

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.390
entirely selling cars yeah why don't

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:01.349
they go to work I guess that makes sense

01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:03.290
I got it is pursuit their hours are

01:06:03.290 --> 01:06:06.599
ridiculous yeah well here's why it's

01:06:06.599 --> 01:06:08.609
usually because a no offense to Meaney

01:06:08.609 --> 01:06:09.210
and

01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:11.099
you know I worked I sold cars but it's

01:06:11.099 --> 01:06:13.530
it's typically guys that either didn't

01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:17.790
graduate college or didn't they don't

01:06:17.790 --> 01:06:19.380
have the qualifications to be making the

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:21.569
money that they make selling cars yeah

01:06:21.569 --> 01:06:23.550
so then it's kind of like well I can

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:25.980
tell you whatever I want like I can tell

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.440
you to work 12 hours a day [ __ ] six

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.839
days a week yeah they can make Bank and

01:06:30.839 --> 01:06:32.069
they usually because they are making

01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:33.450
Bank and the longer they stay working

01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:35.190
the more they met that's pretty tight

01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:39.690
yeah what are we at timewise we're

01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:42.390

01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:01.430
information the least important things

01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:02.540
I've ever heard in my life

01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:04.610
like like we'll sit down we'll be like

01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:08.800
so and so just had a hip replacement

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.990
I'll be like who the [ __ ] you talking to

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:18.500
why are you telling me that that's what

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.750
a radar do that's like I know but I get

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:22.940
I hear about everybody's kids and

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.590
everybody what they're doing and I just

01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:26.420
I tell her every single time like you

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:27.440
need to stop telling me these things

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.800
yeah there's some reason it makes me mad

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.140
when you get told about oh well it just

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:35.150
makes me mad to know that she's that far

01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:38.630
removed from reality that she thinks

01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:40.610
this is pertinent information for me

01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:42.740
that you there is someone the other hip

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:43.220
replaced

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.860
yeah I'm talking like dude that lives

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:48.200
down my street and I like him he's a

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.670
great guy and I love his family I'm

01:13:49.670 --> 01:13:54.320
friends with his kids but yeah it's not

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.240
okay she brought like soup over to their

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.240
house well she's nice nice thing but

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.310
it's like don't tell me about I don't

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:03.560
care you don't hear the local like hip

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.480
replacement news no I don't want to hear

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.550
about so and so getting a pools a big

01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:09.230
pools are big on the docket we're

01:14:09.230 --> 01:14:10.640
talking at holes true

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.680
well hip replacements a big deal if

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.090
you're if you're like staring down

01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:15.770
possibly getting hip replacement that's

01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:19.820
all you want to talk about true because

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.550
it's like any user is ready for priming

01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:24.440
for one that's coming at some point well

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.910
we'll get our hips replace one of Oh

01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:27.470
probably both get our hips replace a

01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:29.360
certain point you need replacement I

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.520
don't know if again dude I might be dead

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.860
I don't think so dude you think that but

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.300
I think it's if I keep hitting this

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.730
pellet on I'm not drinking it I probably

01:14:37.730 --> 01:14:39.830
just in two weeks are probably added

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:43.220
five years to my life I got two weeks

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:45.260
off you're gonna ride that pellet on

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.510
into eternity dude you know right you're

01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:48.860
gonna ride it I think I might come off

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.680
the frames I might take it out as hard

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.780
as I fell on it it might I might hit the

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:59.540
open highway it's fun it's the first

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:00.650

about buying one they're about as much

01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:12.980

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:16.730
honest you should buy one you put it in

01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:19.070

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.250
has been positioned in a wheelie that

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:23.750
I'm just riding a bicycle with a bunch

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:25.340
of young black kids doing a wheelie Oh

yeah with the kids yeah like a pellet on

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.910
dirt Blake we're almost with me you

01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:33.200
should they should they should have like

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.320
a program maybe like a VR program for

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.510
people to run with like like a swarm of

01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:41.650
black dirt bikers in felt like Creed

01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:43.910
make millions on the headphones you get

01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:45.590
to jog at all times there's just a

01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:47.360
hologram cuz you'd still need to be able

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.280
to see so it's just a hologram of black

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:56.990
bikers around like Pokemon go then you

01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:59.690
get to stand there and [ __ ] dude

01:15:59.690 --> 01:16:04.910
circle you on that's a good program if

01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:06.410
there only comes with one Meek Mill

01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:11.300
album it just only plays that also heard

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.860
some news Mac Miller

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.740
I think was Jewish was he really look

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.690
that up like I looked that up that adds

01:16:17.690 --> 01:16:20.000
that adds to my account of white rappers

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.280
are all being Jewish I thought they'd I

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:25.190
think they all liked presenting his I

01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:29.120
was Mac Miller who was the other one a

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.920
little Diggy little Dicky I know no

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.380
Jewish rapper Eminem Eminem what's

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:39.080
Eminem's not I think I thought Eminem

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.490
was like I thought Eminem - Mac Miller

01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:42.620
were both Irish or of Irish descent I

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:45.920

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:06.700
people like look there's one path to

01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:09.250
success it involves murdering your peers

01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:11.860
and selling everybody drugs and robbing

01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:13.870
other drug dealers and becoming like

01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:15.700

shared it dude they're like

01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:19.690
saying that senators kids don't have to

01:28:19.690 --> 01:28:21.940
pay back their college loans and I was

01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:23.350
like [ __ ] I should probably actually

01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:26.200
share this this so true I don't know it

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:26.800
doesn't matter

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.250
this one from Phil goes forwarded from

01:28:30.250 --> 01:28:32.830
the squad squad forwarded this title

01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:34.930
have we lost our minds

01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:40.050
hypocrisy at its best this [ __ ] evil

01:28:40.050 --> 01:28:42.070
[Laughter]

01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:44.520
[Music]

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:47.410
yeah that'd be so funny if Phil started

01:28:47.410 --> 01:28:50.320
getting emails I'm an older friend who

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.390
lives in Naples some are good some are

01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:53.980
strange hope everyone is staying safe

01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:56.590
and healthy the following the following

01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:59.040
points are where we are in America today

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.750
if a dude pretends to be a woman you are

01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:07.420
required to pretend with him somehow

01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:09.310
it's on American for the census to count

01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:11.130
how many Americans are in America

01:29:11.130 --> 01:29:13.360
Russians influencing our elections are

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.340
bad but illegal Mexicans voting in our

01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:17.770
elections are good it was cool for Joe

01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:19.330
Biden to blackmail the president of

01:29:19.330 --> 01:29:20.980
Ukraine but it's impeachable offense if

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:23.830
Donald Trump inquires about it 20 is too

01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:25.510
young to drink a beer but 18 is old

01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:31.720
enough to vote I guess yeah they did the

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.430
Republicans have been trying forever to

01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:37.030
stop having kids about well it's true

01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:40.239
yeah cuz kids get like if like yeah [ __ ]

01:29:40.239 --> 01:29:42.280
that he's like yeah voter die and like

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:43.810
all right cool I guess I'll be a day

01:29:43.810 --> 01:29:45.370
here's how it got a little rough

01:29:45.370 --> 01:29:47.380
the fourth one down people who have

01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:49.750
never owned slaves pay slavery

01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:52.030
represents to people who have never been

01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:56.110
slaves what was that one people who have

01:29:56.110 --> 01:29:58.600
never owned slaves should pay slavery

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.670
reparations to people who have never

01:30:00.670 --> 01:30:07.210
been slaves clothes is outrageous but

01:30:07.210 --> 01:30:08.650
harassing people in restaurants is

01:30:08.650 --> 01:30:13.150
virtuous [ __ ] I mean it came out pretty

01:30:13.150 --> 01:30:14.950
hot agreeing like we have to pretend

01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:17.080
along with these [ __ ] trends yeah it

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.580
was my favorite one dude

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:23.110
I was using uh I looked at hinge in

01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:24.700
Mechanicsburg yeah

01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:28.420
and one of them was like because hinge

01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:29.890
has these things it's like explained

01:30:29.890 --> 01:30:31.960
like facts about you or something

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:33.910
and one of them was like if we're not on

01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:35.590
the same page about Trump and

01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:40.150
transgenders don't [ __ ] like my you

01:30:40.150 --> 01:30:44.380
call them transgenders how Irish doctors

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:46.030
and German engineers who want to

01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:47.739
immigrate must go through a rigorous

01:30:47.739 --> 01:30:50.080
vetting process but any illiterate

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.239
Central American gangbanger jumps the

01:30:52.239 --> 01:30:56.890
fence is welcome that's [ __ ]

01:30:56.890 --> 01:31:00.280
hilarious oh look and this is just it's

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.730
just non-stop it's just non-stop so

01:31:03.730 --> 01:31:05.890
you're just getting like geezers are

01:31:05.890 --> 01:31:09.010
getting fired up just a geezer checklist

01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:10.810
of things you need to repeat at some

01:31:10.810 --> 01:31:12.310
point like sometimes you make what's

01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:13.570
going on you say I'll tell you what's

01:31:13.570 --> 01:31:15.310
going on we see other countries going

01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:17.560
through Socialists you know governments

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.000
and collapsing and it seems like a great

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.430
plan to us that's so [ __ ] fun dude

01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:24.130
ask me how it's going dude dude watch

01:31:24.130 --> 01:31:26.410
this is the ask me how it's going how's

01:31:26.410 --> 01:31:29.170
it going criminals are catch and release

01:31:29.170 --> 01:31:31.120
to hurt more people but stopping them is

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.860
bad because that's a violation of their

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:35.469
rights I think that was in response to

01:31:35.469 --> 01:31:39.940
this [ __ ] jogger this is pointing all

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:41.739

01:31:41.739 --> 01:31:45.940
makes us racists please please dude

01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:48.219
that's circulating that's that's it

01:31:48.219 --> 01:31:50.680
that's a dad forward oh it's so [ __ ]

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:53.950

01:31:53.950 --> 01:31:55.719
dude I knew from high schools dad was in

01:31:55.719 --> 01:31:58.450
that forward chain oh dude this is I'll

01:31:58.450 --> 01:32:02.040
screen share the one that I just got

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:05.080

is it's easy I'm actually starting one

01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:13.150
of these things it's it'd be pretty easy

01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:16.020
to grab a couple bucks off this yeah so

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:19.390

Mary as a member and acta the nation's

01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:39.910
premier grassroots national security

01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:41.410
organization is our responsibility to

01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:42.640
stand up and speak out on important

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.320
issues here are three actions you can

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:45.460
take under 10 minutes to make a

01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:46.000
difference

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.430
until Scottsdale Community College do

01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:50.350
not censor class on radical Islamic

01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:53.110
terrorist so I think photoshopped I

01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:57.040

01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:58.660
Senate to support them securing

01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:00.580
America's medicine cabinet act don't you

real and Scottsdale put their sign right

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.690
in front of the [ __ ] HVAC system I

01:33:09.690 --> 01:33:12.190
don't think that's realize it's like

01:33:12.190 --> 01:33:15.520
