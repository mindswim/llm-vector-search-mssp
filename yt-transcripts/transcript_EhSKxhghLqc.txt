00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.600
yeah that's the picture of the [ __ ]

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.600
people who got elected through a crooked

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.280

a person of color yeah that's virtue

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:12.720

because they can't build a utopia yeah

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:32.640

yeah there's there's

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.720
leaks in there but this is why this is

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.960

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:34.400

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.880
dude people are going way far off into

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.960
[ __ ] just total nonsense we're just

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.320

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:44.480
this is yeah this is the [ __ ]

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.919
literally daily

00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:48.320

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.000
little ass off dude and now son i just

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.520
read this it's like

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.200
and you know quote

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.520
question for my black and poc friends

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.679
because

00:25:57.679 --> 00:25:59.600
because they're different somehow yeah

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.279
well no they're poc

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:03.279
well aren't black people's poc well they

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:04.480
are but i mean

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.559
so you're saying specifically black and

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:09.039
poc no no people of color that could be

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:11.279
anything okay it could be an indian it

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:12.960
could be a chinese wouldn't it be

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.240
basically

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.320
not white people okay

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.520
why would you just why would you

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.679
differentiate that's why uh i don't know

00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:21.200
so she's that's one strike against her

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.960
yeah we were gonna be woke and grading

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.120
this paper yeah it's [ __ ] first of

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:25.840
all

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.279
it's [ __ ] racist that's another thing

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:28.720
we like to do we like to pretend to be

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.600
woke

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.520
and grade these animals i love it dude

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.679
so she's off to a ignorant start

00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:36.000
question for my black and poc friends if

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.799
you feel like indulging me

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:40.720
should white people only use slang that

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.559
was originally popularized by white

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:43.679
people

00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:45.520
the other day i used

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.080
quote clap back end quote

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.159
and was told i shouldn't co-opt poc

00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:52.960
language and i was like oh noes because

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.200
a i totally understand the concern

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.480

me and b

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.520
i can't think of many things in my

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.120
regular vocab that i picked up from

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.400
friends and media created by black folks

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.840

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.000
advice i'm sorry do you mean not created

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.080
by black folks is that what she said or

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.760
she she doesn't think she's picked up

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.159
anything from black folks i think maybe

00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:19.440
in typo and b i can think of many things

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.960
in my regular vocab that i picked up

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.120
from friends and media created okay so

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.279
sorry yeah yeah yeah i misspoke b and i

00:27:25.279 --> 00:27:26.720
can think of many things in my regular

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.240
vocab that i picked up from friends and

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.880
media created by black folks

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.320
the person offered an article that a

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.679
very clear

00:27:34.679 --> 00:27:37.360
aave perspective

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.039
i know what the [ __ ] that is had a very

00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:41.520
clear aave is for black people only

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.640
perspective

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.919
hey wait

00:27:43.919 --> 00:27:45.200
what was that the person offered an

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.840
article that had a very clear aave is

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.240
for black people only a-a-v-e yeah

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.600
we'll figure that out keep going though

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.520
the comments section included a variety

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.919
perspectives on whether this view is a

00:27:57.919 --> 00:28:00.240
back to a again is a an important piece

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.640
of white people checking privilege or be

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.640
a step backwards since shaping common

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.840
language is

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.320
part of inclusion as opposed to tokenism

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.559
aav by the way african-american

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:12.240
vernacular english

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.039
right

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:15.120
ebonics

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.720
i think i understand the appropriation

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.200
in general parentheses again using

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.240
something

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.840
that is meaningful to a marginalized

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.039
culture without having a deeper

00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:24.320
understanding of its origins and

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.399
reference for its significance but i'm

00:28:26.399 --> 00:28:30.360
super confused on how

00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:33.760
but i'm super confused on how this works

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.440
and phrases that have become mainstream

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.120
your time and bandwidth are appreciated

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.520
dude

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.320
that's uh that's what we get ev nearly

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.880
everything just she just wrote clap back

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.480
and now she needs a paragraph of a

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.880
disclaimer about like the cultural

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.600
significance damn dude she hit that aave

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.840
though that's new to me that's tight

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.159
african-american vernacular english aav

00:28:58.159 --> 00:29:00.559
it's like evo extra virgin olive oil

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:02.799
dude it is very similar i'm pretty sure

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:04.240
black people invented

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.000
olive oil

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.159
jk dude that's how that's what i'm

00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:09.279
saying when people are like what are you

00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:10.480
even worried about i'm like dude the

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.240
fact that you need to disclaimer for 10

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.600
minutes about saying uh clapped back

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.200
clap back

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.200
say it it's about shooting someone back

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.720
yeah it's

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.960
just like uh the white men that founded

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.720
this country clapped back against the

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.600
british

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.880
yeah they clapped back they stood in

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.640
line and clapped right back because they

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.120
knew that one day they would find a

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.860
[ __ ] nation

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.240
[Laughter]

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.039
1776

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:38.399
that's what i'm [ __ ] worried about

00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:39.200
dude

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.480
that my kid's gonna send them to school

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.640
and be like i said uh

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.640
make it rain it's like yeah you know how

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.919
to say that that's an important part of

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:47.279
culture [ __ ]

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:49.200
throwing money at naked women that's

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.360
yeah don't appropriate their culture

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.520
that'd be sick though if we uh

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.760
if we somehow reverse that and like

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.520
black people you better not say anything

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.159
we invented would that be so literally

00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:03.919
all their language would just be like

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.120
dude i know you're going with this

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.480
i know where you're going with this it's

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.640
it's a [ __ ] it's actually even within

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.039
those words we invented those words

00:30:13.039 --> 00:30:15.440
clap and back both invented by white

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.279
people

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:19.600
guaranteed yeah i mean it's actually 100

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.840
latin or

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.760
greek yeah white people

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.720

everything

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.840
hell yeah that's just [ __ ] stupid no

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.080
it all doesn't matter exactly normal

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.760
people don't give a [ __ ]

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.120
they're like someone's like clap back

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.200
dude we had to get rid of it but now

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.240
that we're talking about cultural

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.240
appropriation yeah

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.760
that [ __ ] line you had about all

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.960
right so

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.399
we watched there's a show on comedy

00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:50.159
central right now [ __ ] what's it

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:51.039
called

00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:53.520
problematic problematic that's it

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.520
right white [ __ ] nerds by the way

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.200
hosted by a white jew

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.240
dork

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.360
my cousin

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.440
yeah

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.799
it's all about how white people are the

00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:05.039
devil and uh

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:07.679
but there's one part that's like uh

00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:08.640
it's talking about cultural

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.919
appropriation of like rock and roll

00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:12.080
music how white people stole that yeah

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.760
and uh yeah i get it a little bit but

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.520
then

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.520
didn't black people steal the guitar

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.919
wasn't that white culture yeah i mean it

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:21.919

[ __ ] like you know led zeppelin stole

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:30.320
black music and it's like yeah i mean

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.600

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.919
johnson

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:35.279
and you know it's

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:37.360
the beginnings it's a very archaic form

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.880
of rock and roll and then there was

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.640
dudes who put on tight pants and [ __ ]

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.360
like

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.640

00:58:50.799 --> 00:58:53.440
in a fight with my bae today really yeah

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.640

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.240
i took that [ __ ]

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.160
i took allergy medicine okay and was

00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.760
like asleep

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.280
i was just walking around to sleep

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.520
basically okay

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.680
like we went out to dinner and i left my

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.079
[ __ ] keys in the car left the car

00:59:08.079 --> 00:59:09.760
running oh my god that's how [ __ ] out

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.599
of it i was how'd you get your keys back

00:59:11.599 --> 00:59:13.200
i mean the car was unlocked oh that's

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:14.720
not bad i was like i definitely left the

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.079
keys in the car

00:59:16.079 --> 00:59:17.760
i'm pretty sure i left it running when

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.599
we walked back to it but anyway while we

00:59:19.599 --> 00:59:20.799
were out of dinner

00:59:20.799 --> 00:59:22.160
i was kind of looking at my phone a

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.240
little more than i should have uh

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.000
but you know she started getting mad

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.520
about that okay well that's

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:29.839
understandable and then uh

00:59:29.839 --> 00:59:31.680
ah [ __ ] i forget the rest of the story

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.720
she probably thought your own gummies

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:33.920
when you locked your keys in the car but

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.240
it has nothing so i thought you relapsed

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.520
the gummies dude

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.410
i don't do gummies

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:40.480
[Laughter]
