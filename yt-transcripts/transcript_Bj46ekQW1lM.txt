um oh i couldn't be happier for some

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.120
reason he kept saying oh it's free

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.440
oh because people are tired of paying oh

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.280
it's not free

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.320
it's free yeah there there he is

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.760
uh he was fighting again look at what

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.159
they write here too he was fired

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.760
three years after his former radio

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.200
partner anthony coombie's fight

after going on a racist tirade i mean

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.159
went on to raise his time that sounds

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.520
like opie went on the racist tyrant

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.560
weren't you

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.200
i didn't racist no you were being

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.800
attacked

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.119
i really didn't you really didn't you

00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:38.960
could read all those tweets

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.280
and it's not it was what wasn't racist i

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.800
was saying that it was terror i got

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.679
assaulted

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.679
and then i said there's a problem with

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.520
this jump to violence

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.119
that needs to be addressed you should

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:50.639
jump oh

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:53.839
[ __ ] and also did the exact said

00:34:53.839 --> 00:34:54.800
siriusxm

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.960
uh not know what the bell on your show

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.839

00:34:57.839 --> 00:34:59.440
they didn't know what the bell was for

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.560

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.359
my tweet that's what they said it was

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:13.280
the violent tones of my tweet was the

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.640
reason i got fired

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.240
because i said someday she's gonna walk

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.160
up to some guy with a gun and give him

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.280

always goes to [ __ ] hell

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.600
and and the fact that we've had all the

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.520
tech issues and everything that

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.400
you know prompted us to leave it's just

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:40.719
yeah

01:21:40.719 --> 01:21:42.239
it's amazing that we have to go through

01:21:42.239 --> 01:21:43.920
this to get away all this [ __ ] we're

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.360
not getting money from it we're not even

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.880
under contracting anymore

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.440
it's it's fun it doesn't even make sense

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.159
but

01:21:50.159 --> 01:21:51.760
and if anyone wonders like well why not

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.679
just put them on put them on the show

01:21:53.679 --> 01:21:56.159
you can't like we have a certain amount

01:21:56.159 --> 01:21:57.120
of shows that

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.960
this company handles and then there's

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.560
the apps and the

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.719
the updating the apps to add new shows

01:22:02.719 --> 01:22:03.920
we're not going to do that with an

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.840
old with the old company everything

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.360
everything else is lined up ready and

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.159
waiting to go

01:22:08.159 --> 01:22:10.320
correct it's all done the website's done

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.199
the apps are done

01:22:11.199 --> 01:22:13.520
and we just want to take our shows and

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.560
this whole platform

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:17.600
and put it over on this new uh company

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.520
with all this new cutting edge

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.320
technology and great apps for

and we we're stuck in a holding pattern

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.360
because of this horse chat

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.880

boy scout boy that's on train

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.840
boy scouts have decided to uh change the

name

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.239
of the boy scouts really because it's

01:29:00.239 --> 01:29:01.600
really eighteen

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.320
scouts and it's kind of trans scouts

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.960
they're calling it the [ __ ] scouts

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.360
not be offensive uh no they are they are

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.480

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:15.679
organization and

01:29:15.679 --> 01:29:18.320
scrap it right at this point let's hear

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:18.800
what uh

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.840
kristen dahlgren totally prepared for

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.159
how

01:29:22.159 --> 01:29:24.239
angry the girl scouts would be over this

01:29:24.239 --> 01:29:26.080
move for others though this is an

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:29.360
opportunity they've been waiting for

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.520
like all good boy scouts sydney ireland

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.800

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.400
which has been a problem until you join

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.560
the girl scout so surreal to me

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.800
uh to now have the boy scouts

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.840
open up their doors to everybody the

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:53.840
unanimous decision by the boys

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:07.840
[ __ ] it up
