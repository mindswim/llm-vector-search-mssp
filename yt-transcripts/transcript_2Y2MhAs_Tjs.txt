00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.259
board so I was on it from Jeff's Ground

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.479
Zero I was on it was a threat geared

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.240
towards was it like I can't believe this

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.860
like he kept the noose on for 45 minutes

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.869
till the cops got there like yeah that's

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.610

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.320

[ __ ] weird it's weird only other

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.560

someone actually like he got drugged he

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.580

mega [ __ ] Splinter Cell orchestrated

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.460

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.260
crazy I mean if that's the case I'd be

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.539

reading up on how much you know about

00:16:18.859 --> 00:16:20.989
medieval culture like medieval like the

00:16:20.989 --> 00:16:24.019
medieval arrangement I don't know what

00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:24.709
do you think what's your understanding

00:16:24.709 --> 00:16:29.569
of it of what of how like medieval

00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:31.759
society works I don't know I'd have to

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:34.189
what I didn't so I thought it was like

00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:35.899
you know vassals and Lords and [ __ ] I

00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:36.799
didn't know they didn't have

00:16:36.799 --> 00:16:39.979
nation-states medieval society was a lot

00:16:39.979 --> 00:16:42.379
of city-states no these were just based

00:16:42.379 --> 00:16:44.269
off of people's names though so it would

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:45.949
be like you so you were the you were the

00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:47.239
dude you're just like this [ __ ]

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:49.399
ruthless ruler there was not really like

00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:51.619
a maybe in the early medieval society I

00:16:51.619 --> 00:16:52.579
was reading about there weren't really

00:16:52.579 --> 00:16:55.129
countries yeah real Carter's family so

00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:56.959
every year even was between individuals

00:16:56.959 --> 00:16:59.299
yeah and then like so I you'd be a you'd

00:16:59.299 --> 00:17:01.100
be my lord and I'd be a vassal and then

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.649
I would find lower vassals in me and

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:05.240
just went down and down down and down

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.069
everyone that's [ __ ] crazy yeah they

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.850
listen to this podcast about

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:12.079
Inc like the English kings would always

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.019
have so much trouble getting money yeah

00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:17.209
taxing was impossible yeah that's it

00:17:17.209 --> 00:17:19.339
like he couldn't to the unite the

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:20.720
country was like in pot even if you were

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.179
the king it would be like now because it

00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:24.470
was just all family so then that you'd

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.480
have your rival King and then your

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.580
vassals underneath you were allowed to

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.169
fight each other that wasn't part of

00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:32.539
their oath so like me as a vassal I can

00:17:32.539 --> 00:17:34.460
just take out other vassals and then by

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.200
taking them out that would make me a

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.419
vassal of the guy that I defeated to his

00:17:38.419 --> 00:17:39.740
Lord so people will be serving like

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.360
three Lords at the same time and then

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:41.690
you

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.419
a mass in army it's like Amway was

00:17:44.419 --> 00:17:46.519
Hanway it was like a pyramid scheme

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:48.529
basically yeah yeah but it was just

00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:50.179
based on land and there was no goods or

00:17:50.179 --> 00:17:51.230
anything it was just people were just

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.210
buying it was just food and you just

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.440
fight there is literally you could be a

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.590
serf like a warrior type guy or like a

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.379
clergyman spiritual type first and the

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:03.049
armies were so small real armies were

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:05.600
really small yeah the armies were not

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.700
big at all so it was like [ __ ] it it's

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.590
like 40 dudes [ __ ] yeah yeah I mean if

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.620
it was small yeah like like a hundred on

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.570
two hundred so you just want they were

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:15.950
just wander the English countryside and

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.059
you would have like a bunch of dudes you

00:18:17.059 --> 00:18:19.639
just fight sonic [ __ ] yeah we control

00:18:19.639 --> 00:18:22.399

[ __ ] sexy I mean they probably they

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.840
didn't there was no contest imagine how

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.309

00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:32.929

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.420
people just forget about feudalism I was

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.340
like dude these are like capitalism so

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.740
ruthless it's like it has it's [ __ ]

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.200
bad parts but like you have no idea what

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.730
it was the improvement it was upon

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.590
feudalism is like un-fuckin'-believable

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.020
yeah oh people dude everyone everyone

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.180
sylia people doing that said well

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.760
capitalism does this and I'm just like

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.620
delay a tribute like the like all the

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.180
ills of society to capital of course

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.490
like oh my dude yeah definitely it's

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.690
it's like there's only has a lot of

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.940
feudal aspects cloaked inside of it but

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.820
it's like it's one of the options right

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.820
now I mean Irish democratic

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.340
operatives that's the only that's that

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.590
I'd uh mean the other thing too is it'll

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.169
definitely change I mean when we weren't

00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:18.149
feudal times if you're like yo one day

00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:19.620
it won't be lords and vassals people

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.929
were like no of course of course of

00:22:21.929 --> 00:22:22.710
course

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:26.460
capitalism won't always yes but right

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.380
now oh for sure hundred percent we're

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.990
gonna die under capitalism

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.450
I'm gonna be alive for something else it

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.250
might shift slightly shift

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.320
I think 2050 it'll be will be like

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.860
Jeezy's by then and by 2050 I think

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.919
we'll be in like a fifties a goal for me

00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:48.899
that's a tough day 2030 yeah that's only

00:22:48.899 --> 00:22:51.679
two presidents I can get to 2030 I think

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:56.009
okay 24:40 you 2040 I'll be right 2040

00:22:56.009 --> 00:22:58.080

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.639

that how do you how did you feel yes did

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:12.149
you notice the difference between Quito

00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:13.440
and like drinking and eating McDonald's

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.460

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:26.580
snappy though uh on vodka if I drink

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.620
vodka if I drink vodka that's what gets

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.210
me but you said otherwise you weren't

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.100
getting angry at all huh I mean

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.710
apparently I was people just told me

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.379
you're low I thought I was all right I

00:23:36.379 --> 00:23:38.940
couldn't tell but the primal state I was

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.129
freaking out a little again that when

00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:43.320
you didn't have the carbs yeah when you

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.789
don't yeah I was you know because

00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:46.860
there's so much sugar all the time and

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.990
then you go from sugar all the time like

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.539
way too much to then none out of [ __ ]

00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:53.460
yeah yeah I was getting a little my boy

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:54.779
was telling me about doing dopamine

00:23:54.779 --> 00:23:56.850
fasting I don't know what it is I think

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:58.169
it's just like you completely turn off

00:23:58.169 --> 00:23:59.970
all your [ __ ] and like every sort of

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:01.559
slate you wouldn't need any sort of salt

00:24:01.559 --> 00:24:04.679
no hot shower like anything that tingles

00:24:04.679 --> 00:24:06.809
and sends any sort of like dopamine D

00:24:06.809 --> 00:24:08.429
receptors you just don't do it for an

00:24:08.429 --> 00:24:11.460
entire day that sounds like a shitty day

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.679
is dopamine fasting because your spirit

00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:14.879
apparently you're supposed to let like

00:24:14.879 --> 00:24:16.769
your your whole like thing just kind of

00:24:16.769 --> 00:24:18.720
like shut down for a day there was like

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.580
again back in like the 1600 there's days

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.080

literally had nothing to do like if the

00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:31.080
weight and weather didn't permit you to

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.880
work at all there was no entertainment

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.610

demands his full attention for 90

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.100

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:48.770
those guys I stick to my theory I came

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:50.120
out with before I think did you ever see

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.460
him back in the day like Newsradio you

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.100
just like handsome young devil yeah like

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.870
you don't think that guy got caught up

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:59.450
in it you got a me-too on this yeah bro

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:02.630
they probably had a [ __ ] devastating

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:05.720
MT on him and they're like yo bro I like

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.190
you're open-minded alien podcast

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:08.120
whatever the [ __ ] you're talking about

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.850
but yeah oh do you think you think so

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.040
that's how he got compromised he's got a

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.200
me-too in his closet I mean it's

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.150
possible a couple skeletons in there

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.040
you're trying it that many listens dude

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.530
and it's like Jones again Jones as a

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.330
[ __ ] like it's a clown they can

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:24.740
easily be there I was [ __ ] idiot you

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.720
think out Jones the clamp he says it

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.550
himself how dare you he says he's and I

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.520
thought you loved Jones dude no I never

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.480
loved actually I do love Jones

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.980
undeniably he's so easy to make cuz Eve

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.440
I watched an inner documentary when he

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.970
was in it and like he is like they're

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:41.990
like so are you just like playing a

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.140
character and he was just like yeah hey

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:47.570
I did see that chord yeah so he's like

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:49.580
he he says he's playing a character when

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.630
he starts doing all like the crazy

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.060
voices and stuff but you can easily I

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:55.190
think he clearly is you can debunk Jones

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.980
hard yeah fast rogue II was like is a

00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.120
hard do to debunk

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.860
so I think there might have been like yo

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.560
bro I think they got a tape he's [ __ ]

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.210
mean just do you think of a packrat ik

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.310
party bro I don't know how much it's

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:09.530
like somebody with like a you know

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:11.330
briefcase in a suit approached him with

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:13.370
like some pictures he is probably just

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.650
literally like you're making a ton of

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:19.520
money now don't [ __ ] it up yeah dude I

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.340
mean I think that like you remember the

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.580
Cambridge analytical stuff came out so

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.560
they got a guy oh yeah yeah yeah a guy

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.570
who went on who interviewed one of those

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:31.160
guys and they're like yeah we did an

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.810
extraction we can basically say that we

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:35.210
can like figure out what you're like

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:36.530
whatever the person you're interested in

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.150
will figure them out to a tee that we

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:39.500
even they're like we partner with people

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:40.580
we can get into like you know like

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.410
hiring women so what they do is they

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:44.030
just like find out exactly what you're

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.070
up to and then just hire like some sort

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.200
of lady to seduce you and compromise you

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.360
somehow like there might be a picture of

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.040
him with a [ __ ] double and they're

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.710
just like jammed up into his guts I mean

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:58.790
I'm the sane I'm what he did but I'm

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:00.890
saying like you don't like that people

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:02.180
can't imagine when you're around like

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.710
all that money and everything's going

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.150
crazy and these there's people that

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:06.620
definitely try to assassinate those

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.960
characters you know it's nice about this

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.430
you're doing exactly what rookies would

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:12.140
have done before he got compromised

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.850

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.940
game look though yeah you can't look at

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.310
much Brogan had never heard of the game

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:13.070
he's like what games is whoa whoa people

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:13.910
are playing that I don't think they're

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:19.340
playing that it's like they were like

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.970
well fortune came up with the [ __ ]

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:23.650
okay sign is being wiped out like it's

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:26.020
not a real symbol yeah like they just

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.760
made it up to like [ __ ] with people sure

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.680
it's like a funny thing and he's like in

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.320
these guys there's a SWAT team like the

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.510
they're not gonna post a public picture

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:36.160
of them being like white bad white power

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.720
baby it's like they're doing this like

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.130
down low like you looked yeah they're

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.300
doing that they were horrid I mean I

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.940
haven't even seen the beard he thought I

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.200
mean cryptic where they they're like

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.290
what about this I think they got fired I

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:49.420
or at least Stan suspended like those

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.900
guys got in trouble for that and they

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.310
were like Tim Poole was like being like

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:55.869
I think it's probably just that game I

00:46:55.869 --> 00:46:58.570
really he's like I'm not out like when I

00:46:58.570 --> 00:46:59.950
see a picture like that my first thought

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:03.040
isn't like white supremacist guaranteed

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.380
I probably look into it and be like were

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.609
they just playing that game like is it

00:47:06.609 --> 00:47:09.430
[ __ ] around and Jamie's like I think

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:10.900
they're actually doing it like he just

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:15.070
kept like kept jumping in he got

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:18.190
compromised to their tongue I hated red

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:19.960
band I don't really like most of those

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:29.050
guys yeah they all kinda [ __ ] know I

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:31.030
don't know I was back in the day was

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:37.540
yeah I wasn't red band nose dude because

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:38.859
he got changed into Jamie

00:47:38.859 --> 00:47:41.349
maybe he got raped try rogue do you

00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:46.240
think so maybe I think red band yeah

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.560
it's weird man I mean again it could

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.910
just be the fact that he's 50 and he's

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.080
like all right let me chill the [ __ ] out

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.130
and saying like wild [ __ ] but I mean he

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:57.310
is my thing is if he like it doesn't

00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:58.630
seem like he's being more even-tempered

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:00.400
you see I saw him have other guests on

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.440
who he liked full-court press is like

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.450
when Kayla Peterson was on he was being

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:06.849
he was like setting up like oh my god

00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:08.800
well there's also jackets on he's like

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.720
whatever everyone's calling them alright

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.119
true so like that's got to be in his

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:14.740
[ __ ] head yeah it's always like now I

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.920
need to prove I'm not alright yeah like

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.359
I don't think when it comes like

00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:21.609
compromised or like yeah I don't think

00:48:21.609 --> 00:48:23.530
it's this clandestine like [ __ ] could

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.030
be though I don't think it is I think

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:26.680
it's as simple it's like he's making a

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.030
ton of money and he doesn't want to [ __ ]

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.880
that up he's getting called alright so

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.349
he's clearly in the even if he's not

00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:34.000
intentionally no it's in his [ __ ]

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:34.630
head

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:36.430
where he's like I gotta prove I'm not

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:40.119
let's bring on she's mean to her yeah

00:48:40.119 --> 00:48:42.849
that's still compromised okay if you're

00:48:42.849 --> 00:48:44.410
confident money you're compromised no I

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:46.630
agree I agree I think they I think the

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:48.579
CIA and those like those agencies do

00:48:48.579 --> 00:48:49.989
stuff where they compromise each other

00:48:49.989 --> 00:48:52.210
with like disturbing photos and this and

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:53.950
that I think they do do that

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:55.989
yeah cuz they can print sometimes I

00:48:55.989 --> 00:48:57.519
don't think they deserve with rogues

00:48:57.519 --> 00:49:00.609

I'm telling you the people I've seen who

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:46.319
are the most [ __ ] language thought

00:51:46.319 --> 00:51:48.030
police and I think are the scariest

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:49.650
greasiest of them all do you think

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:51.809
Becky's scary and greedy I'm saying I'm

00:51:51.809 --> 00:51:53.460
talking someone who truly is walking

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.170
around Maggie's just trying to avoid the

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:59.099
[ __ ] flamethrower I'm talking about

00:51:59.099 --> 00:52:00.780
the people wielding this flame that you

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:02.549
just looked at Becky looked down and

00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:04.140
realized he was standing on a land mine

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:11.089
oh [ __ ] yeah I'm on the cast right now

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.700
he was definitely calling too because he

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.619
definitely just heard us making fun of

00:52:16.619 --> 00:52:19.740
him on the last episode what we saying

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:23.670
he was gonna backstab me he definitely

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:25.770
was calling for that for sure yeah it

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:27.900
was just funny cuz he loves the gas calm

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.339
that yeah we're done now stuff he loves

00:52:29.339 --> 00:52:31.619
the cast but he won't promote it dude

00:52:31.619 --> 00:52:32.869
it's so funny

00:52:32.869 --> 00:52:34.980
apparently I don't understand it if you

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:36.809
like it you like it you can it's like I

00:52:36.809 --> 00:52:38.940
mean I had to really think like are we

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.140
really saying [ __ ] that that's [ __ ]

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.880
that's that [ __ ] up I think some of

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:44.220
the older episodes we were even then it

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.930
was always just a [ __ ] joke wrap

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:47.760
around bro yeah I mean some of those

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.260
night cast I got a couple of [ __ ]

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:50.960
sides-- at me I was talking about like

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.450
the white man built everything I mean

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:55.570
still yeah

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:57.670
that's not good you that's something to

00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:59.770
say so I'm gonna beg well this that and

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:02.230
that's like I don't know people need to

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:04.120
get off I'm not I'm not worried about it

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.610
I really not I think thought about it no

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:08.680
I'm not worried about I think our I

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:12.460
think we are on the positives the future

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.010
side of the paradigm shift I do too

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:16.390
uh you know I don't anything I was even

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:17.800
a paradigm shift for this the [ __ ]

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.720
that's been gaining traction I think

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.710
he's starting to fall when you got Joe

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:22.210

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:43.510
is that crazy

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:47.050
yeah she's definitely part Irish now

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:49.540
dude as I told her I'm like I'm on but

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:50.860
she's like I have like 16 percent I'm

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:54.390
like I'm not above that uh this is 7d

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.490
yeah dude it was just funny to hear but

00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:59.140
in like of all people just being like

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.850
well yeah and then of course like if

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:02.260
you're saying it's a hate crime then not

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:03.970
only was it a racial hate crime but it

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:05.350
was a gay hate crime so like you're

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:06.700
definitely not gonna question like if

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:08.470
even by questioning it you're going

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:10.120
against it bah bah bah and I was like

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.670
damn buttons the fact that he was like

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:13.960
they're just saying it was like they're

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.340
like the fact that he was being like

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:17.080
yeah gay and black of course no one's

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.130
gonna question the narrative of this

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:22.300
thing it was like yeah the I think back

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:24.820
to the paradigm thing the shift sure I

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.950
do think we are on the right side of

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:29.050
that sure I mean obviously everybody

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:30.330
thinks they're on the right side but

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:33.370
it's funny because I'll see a lot of New

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:36.250
York comics are shifting back I see it

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:39.040
and I'm like [ __ ] I wanted to be I

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.140
wanted to be more at the forefront I saw

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:44.620
a lot of like 50/50 in it and I see a

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:46.510
lot of them going like I guess I can

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:48.010
still kind of say [ __ ] like I don't have

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:49.240
to make a total [ __ ] and they're like

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.830
kind of inkling it kind of like sneaking

00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:52.540
like people's material is based on

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:54.400
calling everyone a [ __ ] right now is it

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.350
really yeah a lot of a lot of very

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:58.330

women doing all the work yeah yeah they

00:57:26.259 --> 00:57:28.779
that is something that's always bothered

00:57:28.779 --> 00:57:32.349
me is like Indians speaking for all of

00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:35.229
Indians yeah it's like nah yeah all

00:57:35.229 --> 00:57:37.420
different just the same as like when you

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.009
were talking about medieval city state

00:57:39.009 --> 00:57:40.779
like vassals yeah that's all it was a

00:57:40.779 --> 00:57:43.209
random group of [ __ ] it was crazy

00:57:43.209 --> 00:57:43.689
people

00:57:43.689 --> 00:57:46.539
so like one tribe was raping and [ __ ]

00:57:46.539 --> 00:57:47.769
and cutting people's heads off maybe

00:57:47.769 --> 00:57:49.599
there were some nice ones sure but if

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:51.069
you were a [ __ ] nice tribe

00:57:51.069 --> 00:57:53.319
you really didn't last well you've had

00:57:53.319 --> 00:57:55.059
it nice you were still murdering people

00:57:55.059 --> 00:57:56.979
and like you had it you had to do yeah

00:57:56.979 --> 00:57:58.599
you couldn't you couldn't survive yeah

00:57:58.599 --> 00:58:00.609
it was West Side Story all day every day

00:58:00.609 --> 00:58:03.039
yeah people snapping at each other

00:58:03.039 --> 00:58:05.469
walking up yeah maybe have a nice little

00:58:05.469 --> 00:58:07.209
season you have a little coalition get a

00:58:07.209 --> 00:58:09.549
nice cornucopia yeah you may present it

00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:12.369
to some [ __ ] strangers yeah see yeah

00:58:12.369 --> 00:58:16.630
that's the paradigm is [ __ ] I feel it

00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:18.789
dude yeah dude I'm telling you it's like

00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:20.829
my big thing is like you know people

00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:22.779
used to think the earth was the center

00:58:22.779 --> 00:58:24.219
of the universe and say otherwise you

00:58:24.219 --> 00:58:26.140
would get laughed at it's like the

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:29.549
majority of us are typically very wrong

00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:32.170
so it's like you have to just be yes

00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:34.209
let's be true yourself dude how is be

00:58:34.209 --> 00:58:36.519
honest just be honest and then it's be

00:58:36.519 --> 00:58:39.670
like dude you are Copernicus dude is

00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:42.729
that you're experiencing life bringing

00:58:42.729 --> 00:58:44.259
truth to the masses dude you gotta

00:58:44.259 --> 00:58:46.239
[ __ ] that's that through that shit's

00:58:46.239 --> 00:58:47.650
hilarious the fact it was like the

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:49.779
majority of people at any given time are

00:58:49.779 --> 00:58:54.339
like so wickedly off the mark it's crazy

00:58:54.339 --> 00:58:56.709
to think about yeah like you have to if

00:58:56.709 --> 00:58:57.729
you're not thinking about the next great

00:58:57.729 --> 00:58:59.259
thing it's like you're just [ __ ]

00:58:59.259 --> 00:59:01.719
around bro you know you know if you're

00:59:01.719 --> 00:59:03.509
not growing you're dying they're exactly

00:59:03.509 --> 00:59:09.609
exactly yeah I think you see it like

00:59:09.609 --> 00:59:11.229
it's it's funny because in the city it's

00:59:11.229 --> 00:59:13.719
like all the everybody's I don't know if

00:59:13.719 --> 00:59:15.459
you're comedian you should in my opinion

00:59:15.459 --> 00:59:18.099
be talking [ __ ] sure if that's your

00:59:18.099 --> 00:59:19.329
style obviously there's people that

00:59:19.329 --> 00:59:20.529
aren't like them but like if your style

00:59:20.529 --> 00:59:22.779
is talking and like conversational you

00:59:22.779 --> 00:59:24.400
should be kind of talking [ __ ] yeah

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.929
especially a route like if everybody

00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:28.479
thinks the same way sure to go up on

00:59:28.479 --> 00:59:29.560
stage and read

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.020
what everyone's garbage it's a Nazi

00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:33.790
really it really is it's the same beast

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:36.000
it's just a under a different umbrella

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.990
dude I was I told you I was watching

00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:39.550
that documentary last night and it's

00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:41.710
like it's easy to look at it and be like

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:43.660
this is like Donald Trump like that's

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:45.640
how they say it's also real easy to look

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.950
at it and be like it's kind of like the

00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:49.630
other side too right now David in my

00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:52.240
school it's it's you have to be careful

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.830
there's like weird little things where

00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:55.570
people don't say stuff the teachers are

00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:57.340
like enforcing it like if you saying

00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:58.570
something we'll shut it down on you real

00:59:58.570 --> 00:59:59.020
quick

00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.030
people like ostracize you and so it's

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.920
like I'm in it's not like North Korea

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.420
but it's like that feeling where you're

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.520
just kind of like there's a people are

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.930
acting one way and then like they'll get

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.040
together and be like yeah this is kind

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.420
of ridiculous yeah and then they in

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.860
class will just completely button up and

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.600
be like it's dude it's [ __ ] weird I

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.310
mean it was the exact same thing with in

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:16.720
this documentary like it goes through

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.910
the phases of like if you didn't greet

01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:20.800
someone with the Nazi salute and Heil

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.760
Hitler you you risked jail so then every

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.770
single person is out throwing up the

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:28.180
salute and being like Heil Hitler

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.790
yeah had to publicly be enthusiastic

01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:32.770
about it stoked on Hitler yeah so then

01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:33.910
now you're like are all my friends

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:36.880
stoked on Hitler everyone's stoked on

it two weeks ago yeah oh no Matt you

01:02:55.709 --> 01:02:58.829
well well here's the thing I drank my

01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:59.939
caffeine yesterday

01:02:59.939 --> 01:03:02.399
oh no pushing my limits why well I

01:03:02.399 --> 01:03:04.380
bought a spindrift my favorite seltzer I

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.609
was trying to get them to sponsor us but

01:03:05.609 --> 01:03:07.829
they're [ __ ] nice to me like the I

01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:10.439
had their seltzer it's so [ __ ] good

01:03:10.439 --> 01:03:11.819
dude it's not like Lacroix they actually

01:03:11.819 --> 01:03:14.399
like it's just fruit juice in seltzer so

01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:15.989
it sound a little weird [ __ ] like you

01:03:15.989 --> 01:03:17.489
know we can't like the artificial

01:03:17.489 --> 01:03:19.589
flavors but the one of them was like a

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:22.199
no-no Palmer type setup and I'm like you

01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:23.849
know Arnie Paul me oniy Paul me but I'm

01:03:23.849 --> 01:03:25.289
like I wonder if it says caffeine it's

01:03:25.289 --> 01:03:27.599
like it's like it it has like less than

01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:29.159
a quarter cup of coffee that was like a

01:03:29.159 --> 01:03:30.630
little caffeine comparison I'm like I

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:32.759
can [ __ ] handle caffeine I drank this

01:03:32.759 --> 01:03:34.499
little [ __ ] dude it was worth a quarter

01:03:34.499 --> 01:03:37.859
cup of coffee drank it at four o'clock

01:03:37.859 --> 01:03:39.119
maybe in the afternoon three o'clock

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:41.339
that's late that's late for you it's

01:03:41.339 --> 01:03:44.609
bedtime soon was like it was maybe -

01:03:44.609 --> 01:03:46.109
dude I it was like it was in the

01:03:46.109 --> 01:03:47.729
afternoon and I was like I'll champ this

01:03:47.729 --> 01:03:49.770
I was up all night last night

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:52.500
dude section smollett looks like that's

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:55.320
gotta be he also had a jerk-off mental

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.350
like the caffeine shouldn't affect you

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:00.240
when I read about it there's three

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.410
different types of people the way you

01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:03.119
metabolize caffeine it depends on like

01:04:03.119 --> 01:04:05.880
the these enzymes you have and they test

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.350
the people and I just lack the enzymes

01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:09.060
to break down caffeine so caffeine's

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:11.550
half-life in my in my system is 18 hours

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:14.400

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.580

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.410
medicinal I was like I need to pass the

01:06:13.410 --> 01:06:15.750
[ __ ] out justified

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:17.730
last I had to I literally had a false

01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:20.550
like me met I know I should be stronger

01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:22.620
I should have stayed awake and just

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.780
dealt with it you know but it was like I

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:27.000
didn't know [ __ ] disappointed in it I

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.690
know I'm only human dude I'm only human

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:33.570

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:36.210
it I know what I did I know what I did I

01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:39.330

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:41.970
but yeah man I know she got you dude

01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:43.950
then I've been researching a lot about

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:45.570
people who are like in recovery and

01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:47.310
they're starting now to question this

01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:51.810
like ultimate sobriety pathway for

01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:53.850
people being like getting off of drugs

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:55.140
like they're questioning it like is that

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.000
good yeah they're like is that you can

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.860
actual tenable goal cuz it's like

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:00.600
otherwise they just you get into this

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.080
thing we're like 45 days 43 actually my

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.510
case days goes by when no point at all

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:08.940
and then you're like I did it and you

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:11.760
know like what the [ __ ] there's no that

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.500
nothing's different they're saying you

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:14.550
have to leave really instill like

01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:15.960
meaning and like some sort of values

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.730
behind it without that officially where

01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:19.290
they toss God and if it yeah if it's a

01:07:19.290 --> 01:07:21.930
person strictly just being like 45 days

01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:23.670
it's like they're saying like it doesn't

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:25.920
work - sure but the meetings - helpless

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.970

I said if I can't sleep I'm like look

01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:41.190
things need to be done measured I think

01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:43.800
you enjoy the secretive I think you

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.989
enjoy the sneakin I don't think I don't

01:11:45.989 --> 01:11:48.000
don't like the secret mission to be said

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.530
like a sneak away just be honest about

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:52.260
it I mean I could I could totally pick I

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.639
jerked off last night you just feel like

01:11:53.639 --> 01:11:56.370
you Pig know what yeah yeah yeah

01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:58.290

sleeping I don't want to wake I

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:01.800
literally you put stuff into it that's

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.840
not there well I mean I do believe porn

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.199
is bad

01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:06.389
I do believe you when you think you're

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:08.159
addicted to porn sure I do believe you

01:12:08.159 --> 01:12:10.350
cuz you tell me you're eating cereal

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:12.300
watching porn for like yes like that's

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:12.750
crazy

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:13.830
that was wake up his check in the

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.030
morning while I wanted to see what was

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.440
on their back on it what do we got yeah

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.210
like planning it jerk off sure later

01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:21.570
that's a little wacky so I I'm glad you

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:24.900
decided it's one thing if you can't stop

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.790
something voluntarily you're addicted to

01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:29.550
it cuz I was like that's [ __ ] and I

01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:31.080
tried to stop it I'm like damn this is

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.290
[ __ ] hard so that's why I'm gonna

01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:37.949
start dopamine fast until I I support

01:12:37.949 --> 01:12:40.710
you yeah in whatever you do I don't

01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:42.840
think dopamine fasting is a great idea

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.130
how are you gonna do it

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:45.510
you gotta do research to figure out

01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:48.120
research it you can't sit on something

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.320
that feels good you can't like lay down

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.239
no no no let's pull it up and find out

01:12:51.239 --> 01:12:53.159
you can't like you got to eat nothing

01:12:53.159 --> 01:12:55.880
but [ __ ] that you don't like pretty much

01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.290
yeah what if you like you know like kale

01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:02.940
nobody likes kale I mean sauteing some

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.469
kale lately and it's really good

01:13:04.469 --> 01:13:06.600
do you really yeah I don't like that

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.820
this is [ __ ] a little bit but I I

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:13.199
studied my um my genealogy my I might

01:13:13.199 --> 01:13:15.060
have the specific gene that is reacts

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.650
negatively to like bitter green

01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:19.440
vegetables and I've dude vegetables used

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.520
to make me sick when I was a little kid

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.780
I said put in my pocket and throw them

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:25.260
outside yeah I mean I had that I

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.420
wouldn't get physically sick but really

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:33.840
yeah you take an entire day for the

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.280
moment you wake up until the moment you

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.690
go to sleep to cut out to open mean that

01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:38.940
means you can't eat listen to music use

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:41.250
the internet or your phone hang out with

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.260

do light exercise all you can do for the

01:13:51.239 --> 01:13:53.130
day invited exercise is gonna be a

01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:54.810
dopamine release but I mean like just

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:31.940
the hard part but that everything

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.620
fasting your entire life that's gonna

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:36.150
that's gonna be tough I basically did

01:14:36.150 --> 01:14:38.190
this once I do this in Brazil I got when

01:14:38.190 --> 01:14:41.280

my flight and ended up in Brazil in the

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.909
airport yeah I ended up in a hotel room

01:14:44.909 --> 01:14:46.230
I couldn't understand anything the TV's

01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:47.850
is in Portuguese so I turned it off and

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.080
I just sat there with a notepad and

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.300
would just sit in my room all day and I

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:52.409
would just kind of like just sit there

01:14:52.409 --> 01:14:54.050
did you do anything else in there that

01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:56.489
really jerked off constantly

01:14:56.489 --> 01:14:59.340
yeah that's what that is sure but I'm

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:00.870
saying I could do it it was pretty

01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:04.290
[ __ ] miserable dude I believe I don't

01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:05.460
think you're gonna do it I definitely

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:06.780
let's what I'm saying I'll do it I'll

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:08.610
rent a [ __ ] motel room for like 50

01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:09.980
bucks for the day and just

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:12.270
hundred-percent it all right my baby's

01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:15.150
gonna be highly against this why oh

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:16.530
she's going away

01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:18.270

01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:19.380

dog sit you go to the motel Joe perfect

01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:27.030

01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:29.880
dopamine if you hang out with them yeah

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.700

01:23:47.699 --> 01:23:49.619
you're like they're right the other

01:23:49.619 --> 01:23:51.690
side's wrong like most of the time

01:23:51.690 --> 01:23:53.100
and he'd be like no that's not true but

01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:55.080
like ask him about anything holes

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.210
support them well dude so he said

01:23:57.210 --> 01:23:59.430
yesterday he's a Keynesian so that's

01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:00.600
like the dude who like we need

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.540
government when you like our monetary

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.190
policy we need government to constantly

01:24:05.190 --> 01:24:06.570
lower and raise interest rates and all

01:24:06.570 --> 01:24:09.210
this stuff dude we're America's a big

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:11.850
Ponzi scheme right now yeah literally

01:24:11.850 --> 01:24:13.500
we're a Ponzi scheme the chinese

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.510
continue to give us cash and we're just

01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:17.310
[ __ ] rolling and we just get more

01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:18.900
dead we're ponzi in the chinese we're a

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:21.240
little we're a ponzi scheme that is like

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.950
for some reason the markets are tied to

01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:24.330
us and if we fall like a bunch of [ __ ]

01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:26.850
gets [ __ ] up so like our country is in

01:24:26.850 --> 01:24:29.820
complete debt it's like it trillions of

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.230
dollars we go yeah it's kind of like

01:24:31.230 --> 01:24:33.270
yeah we got it it's cool yeah I've

01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:35.370
always been curious about what that even

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:37.620
[ __ ] means we're just we're just

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:39.450
operating at a loss and we've been doing

01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:41.910
that for a very long time yeah so it's

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.470
like if we said we borrow money we write

01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:44.910
notes and we just we just keep producing

01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:47.040
the amount of money we need we paid to

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.600
the Chinese and then you know it's like

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.550
anyone you could you could invest in the

01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:52.710
government if you wanted to just a bond

01:24:52.710 --> 01:24:55.080
yeah it's a literal because I was asking

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.400
the one professor about it I'm like so

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.080
cuz they're like oh Keynesian of course

01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.610
you got to get in and help and Bob a lot

01:24:59.610 --> 01:25:01.170
I'm like well then they keep like

01:25:01.170 --> 01:25:03.060
lending money like you know isn't that

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.470
kind of like a [ __ ] Ponzi scheme

01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:06.030
what's going on like yeah yeah wish you

01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:07.560
more money we're making out divert or do

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.730
what we need more money we need more

01:25:08.730 --> 01:25:10.410
money he's like well yeah I guess in

01:25:10.410 --> 01:25:11.460
theory it's kind of like a Ponzi scheme

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:15.810
I'm like that's [ __ ] crazy yeah I

01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:17.670
mean I guess what happens it's China

01:25:17.670 --> 01:25:19.140
like you better pay us and we're just

01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:20.970
gonna be like no come get it

01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:26.070
that's I think I know yeah they're

01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:27.390
lending us money and everyone's like

01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:29.010
[ __ ] from trying to sucks they're

01:25:29.010 --> 01:25:30.120
stealing all their intellectual property

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.490
it's it dude they're [ __ ] foot in the

01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:35.820
bill not a bit not all of all the bill

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.680
dude Bezos all those guys are paying

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.710
money the government ship like yes upon

01:25:40.710 --> 01:25:43.440
we're countries a Ponzi scheme we're at

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.750
a [ __ ] loss or the money's not even

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:47.490
real yeah the point people are just

01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:48.630
making imprinting like all weird and

01:25:48.630 --> 01:25:49.830
[ __ ] we're in debt again guys

01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:51.930
everyone needs a buckle down everything

01:25:51.930 --> 01:25:58.080
oh [ __ ] yeah I've never been I've never

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.180
once so far my life's been influenced by

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:03.000
the economy no no not yet especially not

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.789
the national debt yeah

01:26:04.789 --> 01:26:06.739
things touched me yet yes a little say

01:26:06.739 --> 01:26:08.959
like it all like when they were so big

01:26:08.959 --> 01:26:10.609
we got a cut government spending and

01:26:10.609 --> 01:26:12.499
like we've got to be gotta like enactus

01:26:12.499 --> 01:26:14.899
austerity and and apparently they say

01:26:14.899 --> 01:26:16.429
like that like if people die like

01:26:16.429 --> 01:26:18.349
Iceland did it Iceland got bailed out by

01:26:18.349 --> 01:26:19.549
the government real hard and like they

01:26:19.549 --> 01:26:20.959
said that actually worked for Iceland

01:26:20.959 --> 01:26:22.729
but we started doing that too and it's

01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:24.199
just like we just keep rebelling

01:26:24.199 --> 01:26:26.829
ourselves oh yeah so we're just like

01:26:26.829 --> 01:26:29.089
it's going I mean it's moving you know

01:26:29.089 --> 01:26:30.409
we're all we're all eating stuff and

01:26:30.409 --> 01:26:32.389
doing stuff yeah we're still number one

01:26:32.389 --> 01:26:34.489
but we just uh trillions of dollars to

01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:36.379
just like a bunch of them even though we

01:26:36.379 --> 01:26:38.149
were paying these bonds back though so

01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:39.499
we are getting the money to pay them

01:26:39.499 --> 01:26:40.999
back but it just we're in debt by

01:26:40.999 --> 01:26:43.819
trillions of dollars makes no that's

01:26:43.819 --> 01:26:45.169
what I mean though it's like in debt -

01:26:45.169 --> 01:26:48.439
who were the can [ __ ] be like I need

01:26:48.439 --> 01:26:48.949
the money

01:26:48.949 --> 01:26:50.749
well several wealthy families I would

01:26:50.749 --> 01:26:52.549
have to imagine and it's not even that

01:26:52.549 --> 01:26:54.530
it's just I don't know how the [ __ ] that

01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:56.839
works yeah we ought to have a tax person

01:26:56.839 --> 01:26:58.219
I've asked multiple people like how the

01:26:58.219 --> 01:26:59.239
[ __ ] are we in depth trillions dollars

01:26:59.239 --> 01:27:01.339
and house no one fired for that yeah

01:27:01.339 --> 01:27:02.689
it's like step one

01:27:02.689 --> 01:27:04.249
don't get in debt trillions of dollars

01:27:04.249 --> 01:27:06.530
yeah and you think oh yeah like you said

01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:07.669
that would have that would be like

01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:11.449
[ __ ] detrimental and also again it's

01:27:11.449 --> 01:27:13.999
like okay we could we should the US

01:27:13.999 --> 01:27:14.929
government should come out be like

01:27:14.929 --> 01:27:18.369
that's clear for sure it's at zero now

01:27:18.369 --> 01:27:21.649
and be like okay who wants to [ __ ]

01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:24.799
say a word that I mean they could kind

01:27:24.799 --> 01:27:26.510
of they better I think that's kind of

01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:28.849
yeah I mean exactly what they're doing

01:27:28.849 --> 01:27:30.349
they're like yeah the debts at thirteen

01:27:30.349 --> 01:27:33.619
trillion now Judas or knows me twenty

01:27:33.619 --> 01:27:33.979
bucks

01:27:33.979 --> 01:27:38.539
like that's getting high like four

01:27:38.539 --> 01:27:41.479
hundred dollars an amount like I would

01:27:41.479 --> 01:27:43.429
need like a teacher to explain to me

01:27:43.429 --> 01:27:46.069
they say oh we owe the world like an

01:27:46.069 --> 01:27:48.199
abstract amount of money yeah it's like

01:27:48.199 --> 01:27:50.510
literally a trimming 14 trillion or

01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:51.859
fifteen trillion or whatever I mean it

01:27:51.859 --> 01:27:54.409
grows so if I ever talk about like how

01:27:54.409 --> 01:27:56.839
like seconds and millions translate yes

01:27:56.839 --> 01:27:59.089
but do it again so like a [ __ ] hard

01:27:59.089 --> 01:28:01.699
[ __ ] a million seconds and like I

01:28:01.699 --> 01:28:03.889
don't know like seven days or something

01:28:03.889 --> 01:28:04.879
something crazy like that

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:07.039
yeah or like maybe you know a million

01:28:07.039 --> 01:28:08.449
seconds might be I think a hundred

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:10.369
thousand is like seven days a million

01:28:10.369 --> 01:28:12.799
seconds would be like you know multiple

01:28:12.799 --> 01:28:16.429
months a billion seconds is 33 years mmm

01:28:16.429 --> 01:28:17.569
that's the difference between a million

01:28:17.569 --> 01:28:18.410
and a billion

01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:20.750
didn't take a trillion but on that scale

01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:24.440
we go [ __ ] 17 trillion dollars it's

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:27.050
like that's like multiple generations I

01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:31.130
mean if you 17 trillion divided by seven

01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:34.040
billion people that live on earth how

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.340
much money would that be for everyone I

01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:38.900
can't even imagine these numbers but

01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:40.610
that's got me a lot of money for each

01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:43.310
person if we instead of paying China

01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:45.770
just like here here's for everybody yeah

01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:46.970
you guys all get this amount of money

01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:49.700
have you tight I just solved the world

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.710
dude just be like dispersing billions

01:28:51.710 --> 01:28:53.600
and trillions yeah I don't I don't

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:56.450
personally think it's real I guess

01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:58.700
you're right that is the equivalent of

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:02.090
being like now the debt zero at that

01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:03.410
point it's like how much do I owe you

01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:06.350
I don't know eighteen trillion yeah it's

01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:08.810
like what are you gonna pay soon give us

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:10.010
another trillion what's your guys plan

01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:13.130
be like mmm not really making anything

01:29:13.130 --> 01:29:14.810
yeah we're arguing about pronouns right

01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:19.280
now we're focused right now on some

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:21.110
[ __ ] actor have you seen Empire the

01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:24.260
Chinese know what does empires like some

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:26.330
black a dude faked a thing that's what

01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:29.570
we're focused on oh why would a black a

01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:32.540
gay man a fake Oh a fight

01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:34.850
he's very complicated it's crazy cause

01:29:34.850 --> 01:29:36.320
like if he got beat up by white dudes

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:41.720
then he's good oh you are so many money

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:45.920
ah now we're gonna yeah solve this thing

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:49.850
first you guys Isis we got to take care

01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:52.430

according to certain news outlets

01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:53.630
certain news outlets it was kind of like

01:31:53.630 --> 01:31:55.250

very [ __ ] top-down hierarchical very

01:32:51.409 --> 01:32:55.249
much for the uh but yeah apparently they

01:32:55.249 --> 01:32:57.169
said they when they investigated the guy

01:32:57.169 --> 01:32:59.599
so even they blocked his he he redacted

01:32:59.599 --> 01:33:00.709
his phone records according to these

01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:03.650
stories and then they came out and you

01:33:03.650 --> 01:33:04.669
know they subpoenaed his phone records

01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:06.559
there's two guys they deleted it idiot

01:33:06.559 --> 01:33:08.179
and then they called those guys they

01:33:08.179 --> 01:33:09.650
looked at their phone records and they

01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:12.110
took like apparently they said it was

01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:13.699

01:33:13.699 --> 01:33:15.499

1 3 blocks hop did another uber and

01:33:17.269 --> 01:33:20.209
another way dude it's all that yeah it's

01:33:20.209 --> 01:33:23.869
we can just look at it Jesus Christ like

01:33:23.869 --> 01:33:25.579
this I think they're Eber rides away

01:33:25.579 --> 01:33:26.900
from the scene were kind of weird and

01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:28.610
then they fled that night went back to

01:33:28.610 --> 01:33:30.769
Nigeria for like six or seven days went

01:33:30.769 --> 01:33:32.389

01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:42.439
why would he hire two black guys to

01:33:42.439 --> 01:33:47.119
[ __ ] maggot him or the but the camera

01:33:47.119 --> 01:33:48.709
was facing the north the camera so he

01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:49.939
might have thought it was all gonna get

01:33:49.939 --> 01:33:51.229
on Campbell like you would hire white

01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:53.780
guys you have access to white actors but

01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:57.019
also people would definitely take note

01:33:57.019 --> 01:33:59.510
of them which actually might have helped

01:33:59.510 --> 01:34:02.360
him yeah like if you saw two white dudes

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.550

a guy on me it was already yeah it would

01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:25.550
literally would be more money to hire

saying like you know and that we got a

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:38.159
one of our great debates about black

01:48:38.159 --> 01:48:39.900
people saying white people appropriated

01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:42.120

come up with stairway to heaven true nah

01:48:47.610 --> 01:48:49.650
Joe I've literally thought about that

01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:51.330
ever since for two years I've been

01:48:51.330 --> 01:48:53.370
rattling around like yeah what guys are

01:48:53.370 --> 01:48:55.580
the best

01:48:56.929 --> 01:48:59.909
what a [ __ ] quote yeah hilarious it's

01:48:59.909 --> 01:49:02.340
pretty [ __ ] funny dude I I will I am

01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:04.350
an anarchist for sure [ __ ] government

01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:06.960
I'm not paying taxes loving it I [ __ ]

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:09.750
I support Trump Dawg just cuz he's

01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:14.040
promotes an our religions gay other than

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.770
I mean being Catholics tickets for

01:49:16.770 --> 01:49:19.170
profit churches yeah four provinces or

01:49:19.170 --> 01:49:21.510
the [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] I'd support that

01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:22.530
I'm really thinking about starting a

01:49:22.530 --> 01:49:24.090
church do it

01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:26.159
I want to either start a church that and

01:49:26.159 --> 01:49:29.250
then because apparently you can have

01:49:29.250 --> 01:49:30.719
some sort of like freedom of you if you

01:49:30.719 --> 01:49:33.239
prove that a certain compound is like

01:49:33.239 --> 01:49:35.190
integral to your religion you're allowed

01:49:35.190 --> 01:49:37.320
hat like I could have mushrooms and be

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:38.909
like this is my church can have these

01:49:38.909 --> 01:49:41.460
things they've done it with ayahuasca in

01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.530
different parts so I need to start a

01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:45.090
religion for that for tax purposes as

01:49:45.090 --> 01:49:46.469
well think it's a [ __ ] to do

01:49:46.469 --> 01:49:47.219
this by the way

01:49:47.219 --> 01:49:49.100
try tax purposes like I think

01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:51.690
Scientology struggled to get this done

01:49:51.690 --> 01:49:53.969
sure and they had some of the that's

01:49:53.969 --> 01:49:55.800
there's some like boulders like some

01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:57.420
small religions too but I think they

01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:58.560
must have been like someone who was they

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.929
got like some indigenous folks and then

01:50:00.929 --> 01:50:02.489
we're like yo we've got that 23andme

01:50:02.489 --> 01:50:05.730
back did you have anything dude I mean I

01:50:05.730 --> 01:50:10.650

Irish and Scottish I'm too much of an

01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:17.550
anarchist a little bit English dude I'm

01:50:17.550 --> 01:50:19.469
too much of America's to send my DNA ass

01:50:19.469 --> 01:50:21.600

British trying to hunt down the true

01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:43.400

it works

01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:08.030
this is 2021 I'm thinking 2021 w20 22

01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:58.599
extra stuff like a [ __ ] man I will

01:51:58.599 --> 01:52:01.340
use the [ __ ] now understand the

01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:03.139
concept of fractals which I was like

01:52:03.139 --> 01:52:05.329
sweet I like I like that's a cool

01:52:05.329 --> 01:52:07.310
fractals and how fractals out of it

01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:08.869
holograph act we live in a holographic

01:52:08.869 --> 01:52:10.820
universe he gave it to me I'm like sweet

01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:12.980
awesome I always wanted to do it use the

01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:14.030
word fractal I didn't know what it meant

01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:15.710
I would say it what is fractal me

01:52:15.710 --> 01:52:18.560
fractal is one like so there's like a

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.540
bigger part of it and it like transmits

01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.280
down through like either like a society

01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:24.110
or in your biology and like it's the

01:52:24.110 --> 01:52:25.550
same but it just gets smaller and

01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:27.079
smaller as well okay a bigger and bigger

01:52:27.079 --> 01:52:27.500
and bigger

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:30.380
okay that's quantum mechanic [ __ ] okay

01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:32.570
so pasty I'll explain explain fractals

01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:34.780
to me

01:52:35.659 --> 01:52:39.709
fur babies he referred to his dogs as

01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:41.979
fur babies that's what I said all right

01:52:41.979 --> 01:52:45.829
debunked salary immediately D but I like

01:52:45.829 --> 01:52:49.039
the idea of just like if we could figure

01:52:49.039 --> 01:52:51.349
out this just ran out of resort and just

01:52:51.349 --> 01:52:53.030
just go down there for like a week and

01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:55.249
just [ __ ] the party these are good

01:52:55.249 --> 01:52:56.119
yeah I'll be fine

01:52:56.119 --> 01:52:57.709
easily could get the dogs to take a trip

01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:59.659
that would be [ __ ] fun outside a

01:52:59.659 --> 01:53:02.479
secret podcast walking beach trip be

01:53:02.479 --> 01:53:11.150
horrendous I mean it'll be BYO gummies

01:53:11.150 --> 01:53:14.030
BYO mushrooms I don't think you I really

01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:15.169
don't think it would be hard for us to

01:53:15.169 --> 01:53:17.570
get a place even in like Florida little

01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:19.429
Gulf Coast action with the dogs that'd

01:53:19.429 --> 01:53:21.199
be fun bring the boys out Frank's it

01:53:21.199 --> 01:53:22.699
would be front and center he'll be

01:53:22.699 --> 01:53:24.409
[ __ ] Franks and we'll be down there we

01:53:24.409 --> 01:53:25.999
could easily do this but do you really

01:53:25.999 --> 01:53:28.400
want to go hang out people at the beach

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:31.070
I mean that would be awesome

01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:32.300
it would just be it would just be we

01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:34.820
would set it up and just wile out it

01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:36.439
would be it would be no like I'm not

01:53:36.439 --> 01:53:38.209
even talking like like doing like shows

01:53:38.209 --> 01:53:39.439
or anything down there I'm talking to

01:53:39.439 --> 01:53:41.630
going I'm just going down together let's

01:53:41.630 --> 01:53:43.400
[ __ ] go let the dogs loose on

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:46.340
inclusive yeah imagine just we can't

01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:51.769
imagine like 60 of the dogs do they do

01:53:51.769 --> 01:53:54.530
they do like karaoke there's a

01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:55.699
discotheque

01:53:55.699 --> 01:53:57.769
do the partners we would totally be

01:53:57.769 --> 01:54:00.439
living like partners okay that's where a

01:54:00.439 --> 01:54:10.729
suit oh we're gonna meet up no way

01:54:10.729 --> 01:54:12.679
there's no political ideology behind it

01:54:12.679 --> 01:54:15.289
this is this is just fear and loathing

01:54:15.289 --> 01:54:20.840
dude to me so here's my weed edibles and

01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:23.959
jerking off and imagine though doing

01:54:23.959 --> 01:54:26.090
like like the organized fun of like when

01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:27.320
they're doing like the dances and do an

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:30.139
exercise clevy so [ __ ] fun I would

01:54:30.139 --> 01:54:32.510
suggest we avoid an all-inclusive sure

01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:34.309
because like you said there could be a

01:54:34.309 --> 01:54:39.289
coup it could be like we should burn

01:54:39.289 --> 01:54:42.320
this [ __ ] hotel down I think we need

01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:47.389
to go purely just a desolate stay in the

01:54:47.389 --> 01:54:49.250
country it beat yeah

01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:52.190
I think we find a nice quiet place why I

01:54:52.190 --> 01:54:54.500
need we need the wilderness for the dogs

01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:57.410
yeah you're right dude we can't be in

01:54:57.410 --> 01:55:00.830
public with this group this group should

01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:10.220
occupy like a state park 2021 we're

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:11.300
thinking about getting some assault
