00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.280
question that's what they had

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.120
does this drive anybody else crazy like

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.040
when you go to get on an elevator and

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.120
then the person on the elevator

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.400
like like let's see people are getting

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.840
on the elevator the person like holds

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.680
the elevator like he's holding a door of

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.920
a like a building and you're like dude

do that right nice thing to do

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.239
by the way people thank you whenever you

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.760
do it because if it starts closing they

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.120
got to jam their hand and you hold it

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.280
back so everyone can get on yeah it's a

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.599
common court i hate it very common i do

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.040
it for women but not minorities

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.080
this arm doesn't raise forever yeah it

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.879
just hits the close button

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.239
um i can't believe you hate someone

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.000
being nice like that it's not nice it's

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.400
just an unnecessary weird [ __ ]

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.560
fuck-face-y thing to do what's why are

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.239
you trying to posture

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.720
you killed my son

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.000
it's just a [ __ ] face you think you do

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.600
you don't need to put your hand there my

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.840
body is he's not laying a jacket over a

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.680
puddle for you

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.919
that would be less [ __ ] facey

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.360
that would be insane no i'm not gonna

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.080
ruin my shoes there's no reason for him

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.680
to do that sure there is so those are

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.440
closing on it factors are closing on me

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.919
it will you're saying that technology is

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.400
more important than society's politeness

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.919
and in this case no i'm saying it's a

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.240
it's a [ __ ] unnecessary dickheady

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.960
thing it means you're actually a shitty

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.560
elevator person who lets it close on

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.080
people and are you saying that the hand

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.960

bargatsi and using a jewish accent oh

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.120

find there we've talked before about

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.079
illegal activities happening there but

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:32.079
there's much more to this place you

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:33.680
might find whistleblowers in the dark

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.680
web perhaps fearful of their identity

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.839
being uncovered human rights journalists

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:39.519
might also publish here with an

understanding that their work can't be

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.800
traced back to them critics of

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.399
oppressive governments might air their

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:46.320
concerns there while others just want

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.600
this government

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.600
kids but others just want to look at

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.480
basically

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.800

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.560
yeah just interrupt just interrupt us if

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.240
we break a roll or if we're not breakers

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.680
we're not breaking rules if we do what

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.639
we're known to do yeah exactly

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:40.480
i guess we haven't yet this has been so

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.920
new and unique what are we doing just

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.079
sipping or drink is that what we did

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:45.199
last time

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:47.360
shots last time we took shots

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.720
yeah you gotta do shots but i'm

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.639
basically doing this good shots nice

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:52.399
to see everyone just struggle with this

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:54.399
new environment it's not that common

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:56.240
it's like what

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.519
look at the team over there he's saying

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:58.720
your team's

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.480
dropping [ __ ] are they failing is

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.160
something happening did the stream drop

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.079
if the stream dropped somebody's [ __ ]

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:05.680
dead

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.519
it feels like whoever takes apart this

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:09.279
wire situation should be wearing a flak

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:11.120
jacket in some sort of a hurt locker

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.480
[ __ ]

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.160
you should send a robot to undo this

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:19.120
i feel like every time you guys take

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.399
this thing apart there's a chance the

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:21.600
building could explode

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.399
yeah

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.480

uh jerry the manager from helium he was

and uh there were several gay men there

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.080
like it was uh it was a mistake to say

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.760
it's one way to network we have to sit

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.559
down

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:26.080
we have to say around networking your

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.640
queers want to do business or no

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.679
we have to say who it is

00:21:31.679 --> 00:21:33.600
shane we gotta say who it is only

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.200
because you were black i only remember

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.520
but it also ties into what lewis told me

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.280

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.799

[Laughter]

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.320
how old was he when this thing happened

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.640
to his voice younger yeah it was good it

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.080
made for a great story on america's got

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.679
towers yeah i mean it must be hard to

00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:04.559
grow up with that type of handicap

00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:05.840
you got to do comedy with that kind of

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.440
handicap yeah it's got to be frustrating

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.080
to yourself yeah in the audience yeah

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.600
i mean it's like

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.760
the audience i mean holy [ __ ] if you're

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.200
the audience

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.200
i've i listen i've made plenty arguments

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.039
about this i've been very clear on my

00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:20.559
stance i think it's a weird thing i

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:23.120
think uh someone with like

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.880
a disability of

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.640
speaking yeah

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.679
can be

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:28.559
uh

00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:30.240
oscar award-winning writer or the

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.000
funniest [ __ ] sitcom writer or the

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.919
funniest joke writer ever it's like when

00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:35.120
i think when you're performing it though

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.080
you're putting the crowd through

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.600
something a bit yeah the handicap should

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.000
be separate but equal yeah separate but

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.880
equal

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.080
send them back

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.480
not me

00:24:55.679 --> 00:24:57.760
yeah i mean he came close to winning agt

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.440
and like he's up at the festival so i

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.960
mean i'm just busting balls on it but i

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.279
mean it is an odd thing though as myself

00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:04.720
i should put on my own thing it's almost

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.080
more impressive he does it because i

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.840
would think i'm putting the audience

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.279
through something myself i'd be like i'm

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:11.080
gonna like they're gonna i'd be so

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.679
insecure there's

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:16.080
and i think that they have to be

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.640
good to be able to excel like yeah

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.919
that's why there's not a zillion just

00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:21.840
some retards stumbling through words up

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.840
there with like no crap that'd be good

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.480
yeah that would be good i am confused

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.679
if you're the stuttering comic who's

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:31.440
good enough to like get through yeah

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.080
yeah

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.279

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.559
that was god

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:57.120
and i sure can

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.120
tell we just thought well i thought that

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.559
was one of us again

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:02.480
i swear to god i'm not being a dick i

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.520
swear to god i thought i didn't know

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.240
this was going to be that harsh can you

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.120
know

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.120
making fun of this and they're they're

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.200
the ones who put this [ __ ] out there

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.640
you know what i mean yeah it's there the

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.440
reason it's funny is she if this yeah

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.279
because she's you know she legitimately

00:30:19.279 --> 00:30:21.200
looks two or three degrees less [ __ ]

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.840
than shane

00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:25.440
let me just say this

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.120
shane does not agree with this i don't

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.720
agree with any of this also i gotta hear

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.000
because there's there's exceptions like

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.640
josh blue also legitimately can do like

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.080
a comedy like he's great you know i mean

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.640
he does great and like but you could you

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.919
could have a disability that just like

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.360
takes you out of the game this is

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.200
breaking my heart now and i was making

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.520
fun of it 30 seconds ago and now i feel

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.559
horrible

00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:45.440
why

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.360
because i want to [ __ ] her right

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.679

00:30:49.679 --> 00:30:51.760
cute like if you were single you know

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.559
the

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:54.320
the legality on this because i looked it

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.000
up is depending on how much they take

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.240
care of themselves yeah like if there's

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.640
monkeys she has a lot of teeth yeah

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.080
she got a lot of teeth and i don't know

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.360
if those muscles start going waxed

00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:38.160
tiny television

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.760
sure no one likes it

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.440
i would be on the stage but all those

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.520
wires

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.280
uh jay these aren't our wires they were

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.480
just here

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.599
i guess we weren't sure if we should

00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:48.880
move because we just got that one black

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.079
and white one

00:39:50.079 --> 00:39:52.400
these wires belong to somebody

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.640
yeah

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.960
i almost got in a um at danger fields

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.640
this weekend

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.560
yeah why some guy was like i hope your

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.839
wife and your son get cancer and why i

00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:06.000
go like i don't have a son and then i

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.400
got angry and i walked over with the mic

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.160
you didn't have a son why do you remind

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.480
me i don't have a boy like jesus made a

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.480
girl

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.319
and then they don't police that room so

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:17.920
i grabbed the mic stand i said say one

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.240

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:25.480
testosterone was high and i go save

that could be your face yo how how much

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.119
cooler would you be if you were just fat

00:40:41.119 --> 00:40:43.119
if you're like a tiny fat guy instead of

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.040
right

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.800

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.000
some point in your life you're going to

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.440
want to get fat probably right so what

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.640
before well

drive to work with christine and we

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.640

low and now i'm like four almost 4.8

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.920

shopping for an hour in the mall it's

01:21:19.679 --> 01:21:20.719
the people that

01:21:20.719 --> 01:21:22.000
they're on their way to work and then

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.679
they take a detour and then they just

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:25.199
[ __ ] they're just on the road that

01:21:25.199 --> 01:21:26.480
they normally go to work and their kids

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.159
asleep in the back seat and they

01:21:28.159 --> 01:21:30.400
legitimately forget about their kid and

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.239
it happens the regular it's a real thing

01:21:32.239 --> 01:21:33.600
it's like they did a study on this this

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.880
actually happens to like just normal

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.800

it up i swear to god the the

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.600
but i feel bad for a guy who like he

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.120

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.600
killing his [ __ ] kids or or he's full

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.360

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.400
people killed him i don't think it was

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.159

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.080
[ __ ] thing dude i'm telling you right

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.040
now it

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.639
seems like a pretty big fight when i

01:22:58.639 --> 01:23:00.159
read about this it's not just a [ __ ] up

01:23:00.159 --> 01:23:01.600
dude it's like literally parents are so

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.880
tired they have so much [ __ ] going on

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.320
what it is is there's like a little like

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.159
blip in their [ __ ] day a lot of times

01:23:06.159 --> 01:23:08.000
it's like a girl tweeted at me she was

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.520
like she was like i'll be like i'll take

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.880
a detour to work and then all of a

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.159
sudden i'm i'm

01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:14.239
a road that i normally take and i forget

01:23:14.239 --> 01:23:16.400
to drop my kid off at daycare and they

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:17.440
they look in the back seat they don't

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.280
kill their [ __ ] kid but when it

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.600
happens like that it happens it it

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.080
happens a lot he's got older kids yeah

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.440
he's got five kids how about we get with

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.600
five kids and twins that are one that's

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.880
too many man he was able to handle

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.080
quattro

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.199
i um

01:23:31.199 --> 01:23:34.000
i tell you what though

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:41.040
when i read this thing it [ __ ] nearly

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:42.560
like just reading it it [ __ ] me up

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.239
because you think about like how you

01:23:44.239 --> 01:23:46.159
would feel as a parent i'm not saying

01:23:46.159 --> 01:23:47.679
the the person who's just a [ __ ] up or

01:23:47.679 --> 01:23:48.800
the person who leaves their kid in the

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.239
car to go shopping yeah they're a piece

01:23:50.239 --> 01:23:51.520
of [ __ ] i'm saying the person who

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:53.360
legitimately has a mental or has a

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.040
mental whatever it is

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.719
and now they [ __ ] kill their child

01:23:56.719 --> 01:23:58.480
dude i feel bad for that person i don't

01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.760
feel like that person's a piece of [ __ ]

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.040
i feel like that person's torture for

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.560
the rest of their life if you didn't

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:04.880
have other kids going to jail probably

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.560
wouldn't even be a punishment like if

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.080
you actually just [ __ ] up and did that

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.920
it's almost like it's beside the point i

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.679
killed myself before the cop showed up

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:12.800
here's what happened he started driving

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.480
with the kids in the car and then he

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.800
realized what he's in the car because oh

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.560

walking dead stuff

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.800

well we got to bury them like it's no

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:15.920
big deal

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.119
and then you show them like they just

01:35:17.119 --> 01:35:18.560
show up next to a pile of dirt with a

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:20.639

coffin right to the surface that's so

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.800
much dry dirt digging dude as soon as

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.159
another person died i would just be so

01:35:34.159 --> 01:35:35.760
it wouldn't be about losing friends i'd

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:37.760
