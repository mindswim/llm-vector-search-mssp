jerking off with western vegetable oil

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.919

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.759
pretty good it's

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.400

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.800
your hands yes

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.240
it is better

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.039
lube than [ __ ]

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.280
if women were had if women had western

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.520
vegetable oil between their [ __ ] legs

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.160
holy [ __ ] dude we would never fight you

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160
wait you fight they can't fight women

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.080
regularly because of the lack of their

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.440
[ __ ] oils

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.880

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.240
yeah

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.400

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.360
slow jerking or fast jerking uh

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.080
doesn't matter man the viscosity

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.280
it's still weird because i go so slow

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.120
that it's fast

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.639

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.800
the day come home from work shark's done

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:36.800
super slow

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.199
it's oil isn't it like grabbing dirt and

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.160

dirt in the air on your hands and the

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.120
oil's grabbing off

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.280

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:54.560
okay

all but one of our pre-ejaculate there's

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.040
only one there's only one sperm

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.839
contain fewer than 23 million sperms

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:03.040
uh

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.800
i don't know what that means yeah

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.720
all but one of our pre-ejaculatory

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.519
samples

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:10.240
fewer than 23 million sperm so what does

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.560
the average contain is that higher or

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.040
lower give us some info here yeah it

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.399
says right there pre-cum should not

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:19.200
contain any sperm but this one yeah i'm

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.800
saying it does that's the original said

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.040
it should not contain that that was

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.519
written in 1912

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:27.760
on the internet

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.120
yeah that's what that's what that was

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.640
written by me right that's what i tell

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.800
you one

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.640
that's the original debate does pre-cum

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.360
contain spur it says fewer than 23

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.680
million but i need some like perspective

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.360
yeah how much come is in my [ __ ]

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.120
first shot

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.440
now type in first shot per capita how

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.279
much sperm yeah am i the only one here

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.680
that's seeing this not first no i know

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.959
it says no you should not have any but

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:52.720
then the other thing is saying the

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.560
opposite 23 million this is no less than

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.839
do women taste the the pre-cum

00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:01.920
what do women i think they have to you

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.480
do alex

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.480
that would that would [ __ ] me up more

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.120
than the dick

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.600
you want to put that to the test bro

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.800
no she already told me you could taste

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.079
the pre-cum you're just gonna take your

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:15.279
word for it why don't you try a little

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.720
pre-cum this is gonna chuck a [ __ ] for

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.959
you it tastes [ __ ] but you understand

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:20.640
if the pre-cum is what [ __ ] you up then

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.399
you were sucking a dick for a while just

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:24.399
okay with that no pre-cut i started

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:25.360
i still

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.800
come camping i start pre-coming as soon

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.519
as i start kissing a girl

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:30.640
do you think that's just a little bit

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.000
yeah you touch the tip of my dick and

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.160
it'll be a little string

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.920
that's just actual string you can only

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.200
tell if it takes a while to pull your

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.800
pants down and then when you do it hurts

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.640
because it sticks to your dick hole yeah

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.079
i think

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.480
none of that rings true in my experience

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.480
at all so everybody comes out

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.920

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.880
sticks to your arm and you put your

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.079
underwear down you feel that little snap

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.680

way if you put tape on your [ __ ] arm

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.400
so

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.720
they had a message sold out

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.839
he has an interesting thing he doesn't

00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:36.240
dress like very hip-hop or anything

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.960

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.000
um

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.280

we didn't talk about that

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.119

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.000
beyond that condescending if

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.839
a black person can watch this and not

00:43:03.839 --> 00:43:05.440
feel like this guy is trying to talk to

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.640
them like they're

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.160
[ __ ] two-year-olds who don't

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.720

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.480
what can happen

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.640
when black people really come together

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.680

the l.a riots

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.839
we can set this up in a way i feel like

00:45:47.839 --> 00:45:49.280
we should have pre-produced this but we

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.720
could definitely do that

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.440
he says that more than once oh oh yeah

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.040
just please have that prepared maybe we

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.599
could edit it and make it lewis

00:45:57.599 --> 00:45:59.520
by the way he should be giving a speech

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.280
sitting on a chair backwards wearing a

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.960
leather jacket talking to young black

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.640
you like this is what he started like

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.400
the cool teacher

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.720

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.359
teacher analogy that's right

00:46:13.359 --> 00:46:15.359
but he is cool teaching yeah i actually

00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:16.880

when black people really come together

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:07.160

analogy is the best value

00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:25.920
he didn't value that

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.079
what black people bring to the table

00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:30.640

black people are

00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:48.480
noticed this past week

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.880
ari shafir got dropped by his agency

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.200
comedy clubs have cancelled his gigs

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.640
gail king

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.800
felt obligated to wake up this morning

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.800
and the first thing she did was address

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.920
the questions about kobe to lisa leslie

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.359
why

00:49:03.359 --> 00:49:05.599
because black people came together and

00:49:05.599 --> 00:49:08.640
was like we ain't having this

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.960
boy's name not like that

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.960

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.319
funny

00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:16.880
it's undeniably

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.720
[ __ ] the world on that one dude i'll

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.880
take this one to court yeah i'll stand

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.680
by this one that's what i'll say

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.880
this is what happens when black

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.680
i'm good they aren't mad at me and i

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:44.040
felt people are mad at me

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.559
you know black people are like snakes

00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:00.640
the power you have

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.920
you come together don't get excited you

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.050

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:04.480
[Laughter]

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.319
i feel like gayle king probably feels

00:50:06.319 --> 00:50:07.440
like

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.640
she's on the playground

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:13.119
and she said something out of line

00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:14.640
and every black kid at the school

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.480
surrounded her at recess is that this is

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.760
excellent timing there's actually

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.559
footage of ari shafir right now

00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:22.240

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.210
moon and wizard of oz it's like

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.520
up perfect

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.240
every black kid at the school surrounded

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.960
her at recess and was like

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.079

00:50:34.079 --> 00:50:35.440

have you never met a black person

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.280
that's his analogy is that it's like you

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.200
have a teacher yeah that did you watch

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.520

00:50:49.839 --> 00:50:53.280

i'm just saying

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:04.079
i noticed it uh

00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:06.640
when black people come together

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.760
all battles

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.000
w-o-n

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.240
i'm telling you i've noticed this past

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.839
week he said all battle when black

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:17.520
people come together all battles will be

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:20.559
won that's a crazy w-o-n he spelled it

00:51:20.559 --> 00:51:22.400
further yeah

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.839
[ __ ] okay so even uh the excellent

00:51:25.839 --> 00:51:27.760
montage of cutting into the la riots

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.920
aside he's saying when black people come

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.920
together they can accomplish anything

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.559
like ari canceling three comedy shows

00:51:34.559 --> 00:51:37.119
yeah that was the achievement yeah dude

00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:39.680
gayle king not having one change in her

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.640
rich person day

00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:47.200
yeah but you guys didn't feel it

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.280
i felt it i felt it all black people

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.960
came together i could feel it i feel in

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.599
my bones

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.920
and they wasn't even mad at me and then

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.680
i know people aren't mad at me

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.960
i'm cool i could be borrowed out of me

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.760
and i can feel it in my bones

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.000
what a [ __ ] lunatic dude that guy's

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.359
that guy's actually a [ __ ] man

00:52:05.359 --> 00:52:07.440
[ __ ]

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.040
he thinks that's like

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.559
a positive message to black it's the

00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:12.640
most condescending it's crazy look at

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.079
what you did

00:52:14.079 --> 00:52:15.599
no one thought it was pretty good but

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:17.359
you idiots got together and made

00:52:17.359 --> 00:52:20.319
something i mean it's it's

00:52:20.319 --> 00:52:22.400
look i thought i told you remember gary

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.160
owens a white guy i told you you can do

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.559
it yeah he's like listen to me jerk off

00:52:26.559 --> 00:52:28.800
he said i know y'all could barely read

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.800
i know y'all yeah i know y'all can't do

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.280
much but if you all come together

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.200
you can do anything you want

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.119
you'll have is fast twitch muscle fibers

00:52:39.119 --> 00:52:40.480
i know your brains are a little bit

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.400
smaller than mine

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.480
i mean what's weird is that he's picking

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.359
this as the moment yeah yeah like i'm

00:52:47.359 --> 00:52:48.559
sure black people have accomplished

00:52:48.559 --> 00:52:49.920
something better than that i can't think

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.599
of anything but i'm sure there's

00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:53.520
something that black people like blood

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.359
transfusions excuse me yeah peanut

00:52:55.359 --> 00:52:58.880
butter come on dude elevators

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.319
the modern air conditioner blood

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.120
just like timing whatever and then like

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.480
if i do that like

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.400
once especially if it happens twice for

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.440
some reason

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.120
the next batch is a real [ __ ] wait

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.159
you've got times

01:15:42.159 --> 01:15:43.840
tried to jerk off twice and not come

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.280
it's not trying it's like starting and

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.239

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.239
him lubed up just

are you nervous dude first baby yeah i

01:36:46.159 --> 01:36:47.360
assume i thought you might have a little

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:48.159
bit off

01:36:48.159 --> 01:36:49.600
a little nervous a little nervous a

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.280
little nervous yeah starting to get

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.880
started i think david back this up too

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.480
because this baby's pretty young still

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.880
uh layla that i would say sleep now

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:59.280
sleep yeah right that's the thing sleep

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.199
while you can

01:37:01.199 --> 01:37:02.159
good

01:37:02.159 --> 01:37:04.480
generic advice ever it's gonna be a

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:07.280
while of no sleep and then it'll be fine

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.159
you're gonna have another one yeah

01:37:08.159 --> 01:37:09.679
that's the worst for sure whatever guys

01:37:09.679 --> 01:37:11.920
ever you want another one

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.760
get ready for the [ __ ] crippling fear

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.520
that your baby is gonna die at every

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.199
single moment of your [ __ ] life

01:37:17.199 --> 01:37:20.400
because jay's coming

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.080
i'll be constantly hunting him and it's

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.199
up to you

01:37:23.199 --> 01:37:24.320
but think of the ball that's going to

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.719
create for you if you stop me every time

01:37:26.719 --> 01:37:28.719
and by the way i come guns blazing dude

01:37:28.719 --> 01:37:31.199
i try to hit him from afar that is what

01:37:31.199 --> 01:37:32.400
king harry

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.840
dude there's no advice because even

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:36.400
lewis's vice well true yeah you're not

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:38.159
gonna like really but it doesn't kill it

01:37:38.159 --> 01:37:40.480
until you feel it so the only advice is

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:42.400
just like it's the best dude it's it's

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.600
really hard but it's the best you'll

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.119
[ __ ] yeah you know

01:37:45.119 --> 01:37:46.639
awesome is also is it like louis like

01:37:46.639 --> 01:37:48.719
aren't you like a deadbeat kind of

01:37:48.719 --> 01:37:50.719
[ __ ]

01:37:50.719 --> 01:37:52.080
the reason this is really nobody's

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:53.280
laughing at that is because they all the

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.119
no that's under this man for the record

01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:56.880
three people left and those three people

01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.480
believed it might be trapped but the

01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:00.239
rest of the room was pretty solid like

01:38:00.239 --> 01:38:02.000
now this man is rollerbladed across

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.840
harlem to get his son a [ __ ] uh

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.760

01:39:52.159 --> 01:39:53.920
this the best moment we had matt showed

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:55.679

01:39:55.679 --> 01:39:58.400
together we did

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:01.119
because because that's love

maybe you guys can someday experience

01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:04.000
this

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.920
it's pure america well i will tell you

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.920
right now dave was there when my son was

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.840
born and he was the next person at home

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.920
behind me uh after me and when dave held

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.880
my son he cried while my son was in his

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.080
arms which was weird because his hands

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.360
were covered and come from looking at

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:20.880
peter's [ __ ] for two hours

01:40:21.199 --> 01:40:23.360
jay did not meet my son for two months

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:24.880
after he was born that's not true and

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:26.800
then he surrounds him first he held him

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:28.800
two months and he worked at the stand

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:30.480
which was a block and a half from my

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.920
apartment almost every night and you

01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:33.440
know it was weird the first time he held

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:36.400
him he goes dave go long

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.719
i ran a button round you know what

01:40:38.719 --> 01:40:40.400
he's right in the numbers he was easy to

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.880
throw because while tiny he was dense

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:46.310
