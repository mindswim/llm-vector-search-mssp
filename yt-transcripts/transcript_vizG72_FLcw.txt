could like shoot him out of a cannon or

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.640
something or like just do whatever you

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.240
want like put him on like a trebuchet

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.240
and just launch him that'd be good that

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.080
was the best part of being a king

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.679
it's just throwing your enemies corpses

00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:14.160
and [ __ ] oh my god without a doubt just

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.919
making them land on like a thatched roof

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:17.679
and then set the building on fire or

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.120
just like coming out of your castle and

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.720
all of your enemies heads are on spikes

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.039
and you're riding your horse you're like

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:24.720
figured that would be the case that must

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.960
be no there's no harder of a pump up

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.720
than seeing your [ __ ] enemies head on

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.760
a spike

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.760
yeah

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.320
no there's nothing and then like

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.360
who are we talking about with this

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.679
recently but like as you're riding out

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:39.520
toward the like the castle gate

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.160
everyone's outside like gassing you up

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.840
everyone's like you're the man that's

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.600
[ __ ] god oh yeah when you're riding

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.320
out to the next campaign the next battle

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.840
everyone is like they're they're hanging

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.679
out a window it's just like this is what

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:53.280
the you guys are the [ __ ] best ever

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.120
dude you and all the knights are this

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.799
you will kill everybody and you're just

00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:58.240
like

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.240
and then like as you get out of the gate

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.600
pikes and heads you're just like damn

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.520
dude they were right i'm the man yeah

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.360
but dude imagine inheriting a kingdom

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.360
and being a shitty king

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.640
i think that was pretty common yeah

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.240
that's according to the movies true

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.039
that's what i'm saying like you're

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:12.559
talking about a noble king that i think

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:14.000
there were there had to have been a lot

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.679
of those guys and well that was what you

00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:17.360
wanted that was you aspired to i mean

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.880
think about that dude when the like you

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.799
know we like the president like

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:22.480
it's like dude you were so sick that you

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.559
convinced guys to hold flags in battle

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:26.320
instead of a weapon you know what i mean

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.160
your standard bearer they didn't have a

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.679
weapon they were just like yo i'll just

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:31.200
hold a flag that's how sick you are oh

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.480
yeah i'll rep the house i won't even

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.919
defend myself

00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:35.760
it just got worse and worse though

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.320
because like the generation before or

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.320
the generation after sees what it is

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.400
they don't see how hard it is to

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.160
become what it is

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.760
so they just think they got it so there

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.280
are certain things they think they got

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.880
yeah they can only work on the things

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.039
that they've seen worked on

00:19:51.039 --> 00:19:53.520
to maintain yeah so like either every

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.440
other or like every third king was like

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.520
my dad owns the dealership type guy yeah

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.600
yeah yeah just like slacking off

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.600
clocking out early that's the same

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.600
cut off he just put more of those floaty

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.360
things up just like i don't know it

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.120
worked for my dad one time just more of

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.640
those i guess yeah shirt sleeves and

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.159
shirt sleeves in three generations

00:20:10.159 --> 00:20:11.840
that's the same yeah after three

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.159
generations the finest man after three

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:16.640
generations it's producing just [ __ ]

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.520
richie rich oh yeah they say is that

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.440
real you [ __ ] with me that's saying

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.880
shirts leaves the shirt sleeves in three

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.320
generations

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.919
like bill gates son

00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:31.039
i don't what do you think he's up to

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:32.840
[ __ ] off for sure

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.360
dude he's gonna stink dude yeah i mean

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.799
that's a pretty specific guy to imagine

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:38.720
what his kid's doing

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.200
nothing good yeah yeah i just think i

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.640
was just thinking about like a south

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.240
jersey guy with like one of those

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.080
cardboard mansions you know what i mean

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.200
like he worked his way out of the

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.840
neighborhood yeah he owns like a 256

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.440
thousand dollar like piece of [ __ ] house

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.440
in the development and his kid's just a

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.760
brat

00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:58.559
yeah that's uh i mean that's bill gates

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:00.880
mentality just less resources

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.080
yeah i don't know why i'm hating on

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.320
gates so hard i know man you gotta he

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.919
he's really stuck in your crawl right

00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:06.960
now yeah

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.280
he is kind of like mega maniacal though

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.960
you know what i mean he does have like i

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.559
don't like when the media pumps anyone

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:14.320
up i don't like that it does suck that

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.000
are like billionaire super villains are

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.080
just the most autistic people who ever

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.559
lived like zuckerberg there are kings

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:22.480
dude there are kings i want a guy with

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.000
like an obvious like scar where

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.280
everyone's like how did you see that he

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.880
was a bad guy the whole time that's you

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.360
know what i'm saying yeah we're in a we

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.240
are living in a realm of bad kings you

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.200
know like i was thinking like i must

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.880
have been sick when you had a good

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.520
noble king running running the kingdom i

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.840
think uh graham hancock was saying that

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.520
every world leader should have to do

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.480
like three or four ayahuasca sessions

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.080
it's like that's dude that used to be

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.760
the case i used to be like the world

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.520
leaders but yeah obviously i can't

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.120
remember if this was a thing that a

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.799
friend read or a thing that my friend

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:54.240
made up and told me

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.679
but he said

00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:57.679
there should be a government system

00:21:57.679 --> 00:21:59.600
where like the public officials like

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.679
their families are being held ransom the

00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:03.200
entire time

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.880
like they have to they have to govern in

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.480
a way that pleases everybody enough to

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.960
not kill their entire family yeah that

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.720
would be sick like if there's a vote

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.159
there's a constant vote and if it gets

00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:13.760
over like seven it's like american idol

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.480
they erase your whole family yeah

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.600
yeah dude

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.240
yeah that does determine how much you're

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.320
willing to get loose you know because

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.600
when i was when you were imagining what

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.200
bill gates son would be like in his

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.720
house and his mansion and [ __ ] i was

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.720
just thinking there's no like bill gates

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.120
thinks he's so important that he would

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.440
have his son protected

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.919
off the idea of people trying to get to

00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:37.520
him through his son yeah he's one of the

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.200
most important doctors isn't he of our

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.080
time do you know what i mean okay

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.000
no no no doctor bill gates he's never

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.360
doctored

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.720
he's on a doctor he's like

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.520
[ __ ] clothes dude

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.080
you guys didn't fall for my trap dude

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.840
yeah dude i would never curse bill gates

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.840
in his doctorate

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.520
yeah bill gates

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.960
if you're watching this gate someone i

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.799
just hate that they're like all all like

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:02.559
the worst dudes are just the most nasal

00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:04.640
voiced dildos my problem is if you have

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.320
that much money how do you not terraform

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.600
the world into the sickest thing ever

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.520
i i don't know i think he's just trying

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.840
to be into sick [ __ ] and accumulate that

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.440
much wealth it's not possible

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.440
if you showed if you showed

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.360
bill gates the first time anyone ever

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.120
did a backflip on a dirt bike he would

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.360
just like it wouldn't even register on

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.120
you don't think so absolutely he would

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.360
have zero reaction this is actually how

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.640
you could do a certain kind of test hook

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.640
them up to like an ekg and just show

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.080
them like red bull videos

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.000
if you sat him down and like clockwork

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.520
orange to him a video of like those guys

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.080
who ride bicycles down like favela roofs

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.159
yeah he would just

00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:50.000
not even crack like he wouldn't activate

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.440
a single muscle in his face watching

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.000
that yeah so when you say take your 30

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.600
trillion dollars and terraform the world

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.640
into the sickest thing ever you'd be

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.400
like i just i don't know money comes to

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.760
me all the time it's already the sickest

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.159
yeah he's like no i like needles yeah

00:24:02.159 --> 00:24:03.360
yeah what if there was yeah what if

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.799
everybody had to go to the doctor more

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:06.559
and got sick yeah at least come up with

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:07.760

that's the best thing in the world is to

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:39.919
get mad at the science that isn't

00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:42.320
happening yet

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.760
i love that dude how much money a

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.760
billion dollars is

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.159
it's i think a thousand million dollars

00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:50.559
do you have a thousand million dollars

00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:52.320
it's up there for sure if that's not it

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.000
it's close imagine how nice it is i

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
don't think that's enough dude you know

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.440
i think bill you should be more as well

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.279
i think it's way more than a thousand

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:02.640
million dude there's a video that

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.559
explains what a billion actually is it's

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:06.159
just it'll [ __ ] you stack some money

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:07.520
next to bigger stacks

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.159
three second video

00:25:10.159 --> 00:25:11.440
oh dude it's like two minutes because

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.559
you it blows

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:14.240
he shows you like stacks of money he's

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.159
like this is a dollar hundred dollars

00:25:16.159 --> 00:25:18.000
yeah yeah yeah they explain how many

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.799
times

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:20.799
you spend a million dollars it's

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:22.559
probably more than a million a thousand

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:23.760
are you on that danny are you finding

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.000
out how many how many millions he could

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.520
not be further from the keyboard right

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.679
now how many millions i'll put this up

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:31.440
how many millions is it thousands

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.120
there's millions

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.640
is that you think it's a thousand it's

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.360
i'm so confused now no the number

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.960
how could it not be a thousand million

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.120
it's one thousand million

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.440
how many

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.880
you have a million one thousand times

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.039
that's a billion yeah yeah

00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:53.200
all right

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.640
i'm with daddy dude this is [ __ ]

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.720
the fact that we're even arguing over

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.600
that i mean like as if i could conceive

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.520
a million of anything

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.360
like i'm not even like hold on yeah you

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.000
know like

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:20.640
proof that a million dollars isn't as

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.240
much as you think

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.240
in this video i will show you what does

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.720
a million billion or even a trillion

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.960
dollars actually look like themselves

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.360
americans spent more than 700 billion

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.360
dollars last year over the christmas

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.000
holiday okay the big short one of the

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.840
most popular movies

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.600
is about the trillion dollar mortgage

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.799
crisis

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.880
and my aunt stocked my stuffing with a

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.159
crisp one hundred dollars bills

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.600
these references

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.159
one hundred dollars

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.440
dinner yet small enough to stop family

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.360
afford a moderately nice dinner it's

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.200
definitely an indian teenager yeah for

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.960
sure enough to fill a family of four of

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.039
a moderately my mother give me a one

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:18.399
crisp 100 spin

00:27:18.399 --> 00:27:20.000
it's actually intriguing though ten

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
thousand dollars what kind of graphics

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.600
could have one hundred percent of a

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.799
great sound

00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:26.880
or a wild noise like stock clips and

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.240
photos yeah

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.600
that's not even this is not the video i

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.000
thought of by the way that's a letdown

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.159
okay dude there's in hundreds yeah if

00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:35.440
you watch that video and then you were

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.799
confused about how many a billion

00:27:36.799 --> 00:27:38.799
dollars makes sense you watched a better

00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:40.799
video that and you're still confused

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:43.279
this way was like breaking down like how

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:44.880
much how hard it would be to actually

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.559
spend it all and he would because he did

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:48.399
a whole matrix of zero like millions in

00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:49.679
a thing was like all right you're buying

00:27:49.679 --> 00:27:51.840
a thing for 300 million dollars boom and

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.520
it would just not touch the overall

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.440
picture let's do that 10 times and it

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.279
was just like it was insane you could

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:59.120
have a thousand

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.840
million dollar homes

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.720
dude you could have a thousand

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.559
one million dollar home where where are

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:07.760
they

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.039
all over the place

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:10.880
there's nothing all over the world

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.000
yeah there's definitely a thousand

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.679
there's no california in one

00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:14.840
neighborhood you'd have to have

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.720
neighbors no i'm saying you'd have you'd

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.919
have to be a globetrot you'd have to be

00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:19.919
a jet packer so you'd have to buy like

00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:22.320
an entire zip code in like you'd have to

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.399
buy like but spread around

00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:26.640
all in detroit you have to buy 90210 the

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.799
whole the whole zip code no you don't

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:30.640
you don't all of 90210 no that's more

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.840
than billions yeah you can't afford

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.919
902.1 a whole now whoa because they're

00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:35.840
over a million dollar houses yeah but

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.039
i'm saying you can find enough

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.600
i mean yeah there's probably somewhere

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.120
in north jersey

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.320
is this the first time we ever try to

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.039
[ __ ] with numbers

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.480
damn

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.760
this the number experiment has failed

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.760
oh they got away from me

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.919
i'm right

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.380
[Music]

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:08.799
so they can hear it in beverly hills

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:11.360
there's over what was it 17 000

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.039
million dollar homes that's almost a

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:14.799
million or more plenty of so you

00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:16.000
wouldn't even notice if you don't only

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.640
have that's like one block two

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.559
there's 17 of what you're trying to

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:23.600
imagine owning an entire block of 90210

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.480
that would be so so lonely yeah right

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.240
dude you're kidding me their houses are

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.840
already kind of far apart i think yeah

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.520
yeah it'd be world war z but the hose

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.200
would be world war z in your [ __ ]

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.240
walls dude that's hoe central

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.559
nano 210

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:40.320
chicks like like getting concussions

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.840
from ramming their heads in the wall

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.760
oh man that's indisputable yeah dude

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.120
that's absolutely in dispute yeah you

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.880
thought you were saying hoes central

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.559
like water fights that's what you're

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:54.399
trying i thought you were trying to set

00:29:54.399 --> 00:29:56.880
up like a battle royale water fight

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.720
you could have if you had that set up

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.799
you could have make your your gardeners

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.080
fight each other you have a whole block

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.760
date of 901 you got a whole block of

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.120
90210 yeah no fences but like blackwater

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.640
running your security and as soon as

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.240
someone steps on your [ __ ] property

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.279
you just

00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:12.799
obliterate obliterate them dude it's

00:30:12.799 --> 00:30:14.399
like a [ __ ] stinger missile run them

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:15.919
over with an atv if you want yeah you

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:17.679
literally you should defend just defend

00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:19.360
the property at all costs

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.720
yeah i would spend if i two billion i

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.320
spent a billion on a block and one 19102

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.399
and then i would spend a billion dollars

00:30:26.399 --> 00:30:27.919
in private security

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:31.120
which is absolutely eviscerated

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.960
aircraft carrier like parked and leaning

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.520
on its side

00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:41.840
i would set up like an obstacle course

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.919
and just [ __ ] eviscerate humanity i

00:30:43.919 --> 00:30:45.520
would destroy your tower i would just

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.039
eviscerate hope i would get so many

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:49.360
upgrades and destroy your tower defense

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.799
no wait wait wait wait wait wait where

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:52.480
would you start where would you start

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.960
your tower simple turrets obviously okay

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.480
simple turrets i probably only get three

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.080
to start out with until i can level up

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.960
but

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.240
yeah i do simple terrorists i would have

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.919
two things toward the front that shoot

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:03.840
like a red blob that like splashes and

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.120
destroys a bunch of things yeah but you

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.720
got a space so you need that that's just

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.919
for the first couple rounds dude

00:31:07.919 --> 00:31:10.799
obviously i'm going to add something

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:12.000
the front of this this is what i would

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.919
go with the frontal assault i'm not big

00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:14.960
in the tower defense the frontal

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.360
assault's absolutely like crucial but i

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.720
i need to stagger my weaponry of course

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.320
two dudes at the very back that are

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.080
firing like a like a little piece it's a

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.360
finisher

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.720
you're the last line of hope it's a

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.399
little finisher and a long-range middle

00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:30.880
guy that's huge yeah and i i set a guy

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.320
up front guy in the middle and i'm just

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.799
beefing up guys between attacks but he

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:36.720
gets the job done yeah but it's like you

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.559
what you do is you beef up all your xp

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:39.919
points into that middle gun because

00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:41.360
that's got you're getting the range so

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.120
it's hitting people up front all the way

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.159
till they come and then you got that

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:46.000
little little peashooter at the end dude

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.919
i was looking up like sick tower defense

00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:50.399
games today yes i was playing like a

00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:51.919
game kind of like that called uh like

00:31:51.919 --> 00:31:54.480
vampire survivors or something and

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.399
you're like a dude who's basically a

00:31:56.399 --> 00:31:58.000
one-man tower defense like you're

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.039
walking around getting like tower

00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:00.399
defense upgrades while you're being

00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:02.080
sworn by like zombies and vampires and

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:02.960
[ __ ]

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.080

all automatic it's just like you're the

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.880
tower defense but it's like

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.480

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.679
the point where i'm like

00:32:21.679 --> 00:32:23.840
oh they're just making the enemies just

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.679
hard enough to meet and they're scaling

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:26.799
they're scaling them up so that i'm

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:28.240

every time i play a tower defense game i

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.960

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.960
have learned something instead yeah i

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.880

00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:45.120
too

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.360
because when you said uh uh get the guy

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.120
with the ball it made me think what did

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.960
you guys call that game when you were

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.320

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.120
names of those games are concerned yeah

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.320
bowling in the pitch kind of wild

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.679
pulling the pit though i think would

00:33:09.679 --> 00:33:12.640
infer that the person who's it is like

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.240
being aborted yeah that's what i'm kind

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.840
of saying honestly

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.440
we all had to get them yeah that's what

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.360
i'm saying yeah yeah yeah

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.720
let's make grandiose we were just more

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.919
the bulls in the pit

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:29.840
yeah yeah we were just like pretending a

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.840
guy was a homosexual and just trying to

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.760
kiss some attacks

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.880
trying to kiss him

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.440
lighthearted oh yeah you're gay

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.399

00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:40.000
when your dad makes you smack smoke the

yeah much like bowling the pit that

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.880
everyone should be avoiding the cue ball

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.559
in the pit yeah what happens if the ball

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:03.679

00:35:51.839 --> 00:35:53.359
just watching a minivan break the

00:35:53.359 --> 00:35:54.960
[ __ ] sound barrier you know it would

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.960
probably be as rare as like a no-hitter

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.720
like it'd be in the news the next day it

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.000
would be front page of the news like

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.320

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.160
he didn't get any [ __ ] dude that woman

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.599
the woman is definitely choosing to ride

00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:06.880
home with you there's no way she's gonna

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.359
let that slide yeah her last chance to

00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:12.000
psychologically [ __ ] you on the way out

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.520
dude that's the most powerful car ride

home like like there's no more powerful

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.160
woman in the world in that moment

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.480
yeah that's it and then then there's

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.920
also a part of your psyche that has to

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.000
be like did you even want me to win

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.800

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.400

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.920

like shadow boxing the camera when i was

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.960
up why why couldn't you like scream at

her you know shut out wives get murdered

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.240
we gotta talk ufc guys into putting this

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.359
on the line

00:36:57.359 --> 00:36:59.440
that'd be so funny

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.960
yeah i mean it's only a matter of time

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.280
before like a wigger and a russian dude

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.280
put this on the table

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.800
i mean it's we're we're headed there

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.560
don't yeah don't worry about it that's

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.880
true yeah that's true that'll happen

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.240
smash right there's two dudes there i

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.440
mean that's what old wars were about

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.200
who's arguing right now jorge mosfet all

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.839
and uh and who else apparently this dude

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:20.480
accused jorge of like dming his wife

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.599
maybe it's a different guy but it was

00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:23.040
like the wife responded to one of his

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.000
stories

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.920
and jorge was just like cool that's

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:26.960
what's up

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.240
so now this guy's like i want to fight

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.400
jorge he dm my wife

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.320
oh yeah yeah so i think we're on our way

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.480
if we maybe if we get people to tweet

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.760
enough like

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.960
i think you should be allowed to [ __ ]

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.320
her a little bit for maybe for two

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.440
minutes if you're trying two minutes

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.400
dude

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.680
obviously they have to be like yeah

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.880
that's something i'd be interested in

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.240
wagering

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.520
yeah

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.200
yeah that would be uh i mean that's what

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.200
ancient wars were

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.480
oh you would just smash through the

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.839
enemy lines and you would you wouldn't

00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:54.400
you would just get like

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.720
generations

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.800
you'd be like nice i got my son a wife

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.240
you were to devastate some dudes and be

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.440
like yeah you're gonna marry my son yeah

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.960
it is tough to that hit me i think that

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.560
was in the northman

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.240
they won a big battle and then it was

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.920
like you're fired up because they won

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.680
and they like were crushing dudes heads

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.280
and then immediately after they just go

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.520
in it's just like

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.240
time to rape oh yeah for sure

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.079
but i mean it's like yeah i don't know i

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:19.920
mean i just [ __ ] defend this it is

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.160
funny though to like the idea of like

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.079
hearing that your your side is losing

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:26.000
the war and then all the women start

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.640
washing their [ __ ]

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.079
it won't be funny as you're losing the

00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:31.359
war to blame the women for what they're

00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:32.800
wearing because i told you not to [ __ ]

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.440
you

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.440
these guys saw that they [ __ ] fired

now you can't even do that although do

00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:49.680
you think you think back in the village

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.760

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.880

it's god's team dude yeah you couldn't

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.760
have any fans like when you're back then

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.040

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.560
team or that it was like or death oh

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.839
that's so funny that's what i think

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:12.960
that's what's left over if you're like

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.720
at the imagine if you were a big [ __ ]

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.079
though like every time on the battery

00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:18.400

the other team comes back how many do

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.079

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.400
obsession with sports is

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.240
just watching guys who could possibly

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.400

just like break it in half yeah they

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.880

shackles around all the broads necks and

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:23.839
then like march them out while like the

00:40:23.839 --> 00:40:25.359

of the huts just like check that out

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.960

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.480
your [ __ ] getting

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.359
like

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:35.040
[ __ ] and that's when your team wins

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.119
yeah when your team wins that deep sense

00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:38.960
of joy is like

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.040

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.280
their head on a subconscious level their

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.960

00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:04.880
that's what's going on i think i've

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.240
always tried to figure out like dude for

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.800
real for real why do people here

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.480
and there i just finally unlocked that

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.920
thank you

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.839
so we did we figured that out thank god

00:41:13.839 --> 00:41:15.440
we figured that out billion dollar

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.119
industry it makes sense why you know

00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:19.040
it's a big deal you're just feeling the

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.520
coffers dude so they can campaign for

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.119
sure

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:24.160
oh man

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.760
that took a lot out of me yeah that was

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.760
that was fun yeah i feel we didn't even

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.680
start yet that was funny now it's fun

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.800
knowing that

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.400
sports fans are just a bunch of dudes

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.680
that don't think they can protect their

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.359
woman's butthole

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:36.480
from the morons

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.160
yeah they're just lasered that's like

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.760
they're lasered in on that yeah that's

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.359
that's a fair thing if you're

00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:42.400
but they're also probably not going to

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.640
die fighting

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.680
really

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.200
yeah they're going to accept defeat yeah

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.640
no defeat means that your wife gets

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.079
bought that's a reincarnation that's why

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:51.359
they're putting it in they're putting it

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:52.720
in the hands of the eagles to protect

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.400

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.480
eagles fan if you if you let a viking

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.920
pressure on some level oh yeah that has

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.000
to suck like hitting middle age as like

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.400

for a superstar that doesn't pan out and

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.000
it's just like 10 years of sucking yeah

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.119
dude then you talk to your kid from

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.720

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.240
it doesn't carry the same weight i feel

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.359
like dude like

00:45:05.359 --> 00:45:07.200
for for me i got into basketball because

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.119
of kobe bryant yeah

00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:11.040
that was it he pulled me in really yeah

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.119
yeah so it was just like

00:45:13.119 --> 00:45:14.160
are you talking about watching

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.000
basketball yeah like so i was late in

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.119
the game

00:45:17.119 --> 00:45:19.119
when i got into watching like being a

00:45:19.119 --> 00:45:21.920
fan of basketball like i wasn't a kid

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.319
that grew up a fan of sports yeah you

00:45:24.319 --> 00:45:26.079
know what i mean like i didn't

00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:27.760
have a [ __ ] team in anything yeah

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.839
yeah i didn't know what the teams were

00:45:29.839 --> 00:45:31.599
so who was your i guess your l.a lakers

00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:34.079
playing for a while yeah yeah yeah

00:45:34.079 --> 00:45:36.000
i mean course are you a la lakers fan

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.760
during shaq kobe

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.720
uh

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.119
listen dude you would be dangerous

00:45:41.119 --> 00:45:43.280
iverson's hard to [ __ ]

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.480
dude i was

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.560
i was also i was a kobe and an iverson

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.480
fan what happened what was that like for

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.839
you when they played that was pretty

00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:51.359
sick dude i was just getting to see two

00:45:51.359 --> 00:45:53.440
titans of uh philly you have a dog in

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.040
the fight no they both represent philly

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.920
kobe's from lower marion iverson plays

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.000
for philly so that was like they were

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.920
both defending the village yeah

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.760
that makes sense from opposite ends of

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.680
the field different ways you know what i

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.480
mean no that makes perfect sense yeah

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.119
yeah kobe was the [ __ ] man

00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:13.200
yeah he was good he was pretty good at

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.560
basketball i remember when he got that

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.119
uh no no no no no not just basketball do

00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:19.280
kobe was the [ __ ] what did he do dude

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.280
i mean he's easily besides that dude

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.720
definite consensual sex with that lady

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.800
dude he caught a bum rap what happened

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:25.760
was

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.680
if from from my perspective looking at

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.040
the case i'm not a lee i'm not i'm not a

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.119
legal expert for sure right

00:46:31.119 --> 00:46:32.000
but

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.079
it seemed like a dude found out that

00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:36.240
kobe [ __ ] his chick

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.440
and then

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.280
what would ensue ensued if you found out

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.640
that kobe [ __ ] your chick that's a

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.000
double violation because he's supposed

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.079
to be protecting the walls and he broke

00:46:44.079 --> 00:46:45.839
through from a sacred space to actually

00:46:45.839 --> 00:46:48.400
[ __ ] your wife yeah dude that's you know

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.640
you make it he made her he made her say

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.440
that

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.000
again this is

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.240
pure speculation sure but like that's

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.920
that's what started that that girl's

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.839
yeah like a [ __ ] downward spiral from

00:46:59.839 --> 00:47:01.359
all that [ __ ] she did yeah it wasn't

00:47:01.359 --> 00:47:03.599
good that that he or she the the chick

00:47:03.599 --> 00:47:06.240
that accused kobe of rape yeah yeah that

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.440
[ __ ] her up for a while you know the

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.599
ruling on that was the judge found more

00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:12.240
different come in here and was like [ __ ]

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.440
basically he was like all these shakes

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.440
of [ __ ] yeah what i understand again i

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.119
only ever skim news articles and kind of

00:47:17.119 --> 00:47:19.440
let my mind make up the rest yeah

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.040
half my news understanding is pure

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.319
fantasy

00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:24.400
i skim so hard that like i i have a lot

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.599
of [ __ ] wrong but i'm like here's what's

00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:26.880
going on

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.480
and i like is there a dude's version of

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.280
having multiple come in you

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.440
what do you mean oh

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.800
like having a question like having too

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.040
much wet on your dick like i think most

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.599
dudes would would want that kind of like

00:47:39.599 --> 00:47:41.359
sexual validation like yeah they found

00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:42.720
multiple different kinds of come with me

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.200
i'm not bragging yeah she was wasted on

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.960
women i mean

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.559
if they could give you a covet test for

00:47:48.559 --> 00:47:50.640
like the last time and how much you got

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.040
is yeah you'd be like [ __ ] i gotta stay

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.330
home for two weeks sorry guys

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:56.720
[Laughter]

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.400
sorry or what if you got like a water

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.800
department like meter installed

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.960
somewhere and it measured your volume

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.079
that you're putting that you're putting

00:48:04.079 --> 00:48:05.440
you had like hard numbers that you could

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:06.880
just share with people i think china's

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.400
working on this right now

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.720
you might have the come utility meter

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.559
like a monthly plan of how much load you

00:48:12.559 --> 00:48:14.800
can get out mine would definitely suck

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.559
mine would be seasonal mine would you

00:48:16.559 --> 00:48:17.440
like something this would be a great

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.440
early go

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.240
this would be rollover

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.920
early warning system for school shooters

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.680
yeah

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.000
that's a good point oh that would be

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.200
like if they're if they're coming

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.359
frequently and it's very small amounts

00:48:29.359 --> 00:48:30.880
then it's clear that they're just like

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.040
in selling it they're going full goblin

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.359
mode on the computer

00:48:35.359 --> 00:48:37.359
it's time to step in it's like a little

00:48:37.359 --> 00:48:39.200
bit stretched out and like it's water

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.480
numbers yeah they're just doing like

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.559
watery [ __ ] squirts

00:48:42.559 --> 00:48:44.400
i remember being such a gremlin dude

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.280
doing like watery [ __ ] fourth time

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.000
that day squirts dude

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.640
it barely makes it out

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.240
it's crazy

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.520
yeah at that point it's just a show

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.720
you're at that point like you're just

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.240
the guy shooting like the tenth bag just

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.160
trying to feel normal

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.960
you're just [ __ ] like

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.359
yeah it's funny it's funny that we all

00:49:05.359 --> 00:49:06.800
basically go through like a crippling

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.559
masturbation addiction at some point in

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:10.960
a lot like an almost ridiculous level i

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.720
don't know i mean let's is anyone like i

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.079
mean you can't know what too much is

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:16.480
unless you masturbate too much yeah is

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.720
anyone not like mad like jerked off like

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.720
at least five times a day a couple times

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.920
yeah i think everyone's pushed himself

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:27.680
to the brink yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:29.520
actually it probably happened during the

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.200
spring because every time i feel like

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.520
the first spring breeze i'm instantly

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.319
taken back to like a very erotic time

00:49:36.319 --> 00:49:37.839
alone as a boy

00:49:37.839 --> 00:49:39.760
yeah that makes sense

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.599
i'm very i think i was sexually awakened

00:49:41.599 --> 00:49:43.599
by like a spring breeze coming through

00:49:43.599 --> 00:49:44.400
my window

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.760
that makes sense

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.440
yeah if i'm very scent like if i have

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.160
like a certain smell i get activated

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.240
i'm like an old hound dog dude i want to

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.079

a car seat on one window so there's only

01:00:51.599 --> 01:00:53.359
window and [ __ ]

01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:55.119

window seat you you get in and they're

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.079
both trying to avoid being the one that

01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:01.680
gets in the car first is that purely

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.880
psychological because i've nev i've

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.079
always sat in the middle maybe i'm a

01:01:04.079 --> 01:01:06.240
[ __ ] but i'm like dude

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.920
like never i've never like you know it's

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.200
not like an airplane like i can still

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.880
see out the window i've never been like

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.559
this is [ __ ] me up yeah you see how

01:01:12.559 --> 01:01:14.079
both windows

01:01:14.079 --> 01:01:15.599
yeah i've never minded the middle at all

01:01:15.599 --> 01:01:16.640
i mean it's like i never want to say

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.319
this to them this way so i could ride

01:01:18.319 --> 01:01:19.760
[ __ ] you know i'm like comfortable

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.440
riding [ __ ] but that's just your inner

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.720
yes my liege yeah it might be or it's a

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.079
stan

01:01:26.079 --> 01:01:28.400
like it's your shamanness like it's the

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.799
middle way

01:01:30.799 --> 01:01:32.160
i don't know i think maybe i just hate

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.680
confrontation but

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.480
yeah

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.920
now i'm reading a book about shamanism

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.440
right now it's pretty tight

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.440
anything uh any misconceptions that you

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.160
had so far yeah kind of like uh

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.839
well it's it's just still people don't

01:01:43.839 --> 01:01:45.839
really know because a lot of the idea of

01:01:45.839 --> 01:01:47.520
shamanism

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.119
shaman was a word that was like taken

01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:50.559
from like siberia that was really

01:01:50.559 --> 01:01:53.599
something but there are holy dudes in

01:01:53.599 --> 01:01:55.520
india called shamanos so it was there

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.599
wasn't a root word for like holy men

01:01:57.599 --> 01:02:00.480
type dudes but they in anthropology a

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.319
long time ago they were like oh these

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:04.079
are just crazy dudes

01:02:04.079 --> 01:02:05.839
and then like they had this like change

01:02:05.839 --> 01:02:07.039
of heart where they're like no they

01:02:07.039 --> 01:02:09.119
actually those dudes actually like

01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:11.280
know everything or like keeping order

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.520
within this chaotic setup but like this

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.799
idea of shamanism they're saying it's

01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:16.559
like almost like made up by anthropology

01:02:16.559 --> 01:02:17.920
i think that back then the main

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.920
difference between like an incredibly

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.920
crazy dude and a shaman was like just a

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.000
cool stick

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.760
like if you were if you were wilding out

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.520
on the edge of the huts and like

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.280
screaming at the sky and [ __ ] like that

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.119
people be like damn he's gonna die but

01:02:31.119 --> 01:02:32.319
if you had like a cool stick they'd be

01:02:32.319 --> 01:02:34.319
like i hope he can save my children if

01:02:34.319 --> 01:02:36.079
yeah if they respected your stick enough

01:02:36.079 --> 01:02:38.640
to call it a staff yeah dude right if

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:39.760
they call it because if once they start

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.799
calling it a stick that's when they

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:42.400
start losing respect well the problem is

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.520
shaman culture is completely

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.079
decentralized so like anyone can jump in

01:02:46.079 --> 01:02:47.680
the fray and try to claim shamanism what

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.520
a stick anybody can jump in with a stick

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.960
yeah dude like you can just fully jump

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.000
into the mix they were talking about

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.039
they're down i think people have an

01:02:53.039 --> 01:02:54.960
innate sense though of like is that

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.799
stick cool enough for him to be ashamed

01:02:56.799 --> 01:02:58.400
what's happening usually you're going

01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.599
and telling people your dreams and

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:00.880
there's like a built-in network in the

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.319
community that hears like certain types

01:03:02.319 --> 01:03:04.079
of dreams and they're like

01:03:04.079 --> 01:03:05.200
oh my god

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.559
he's upon us

01:03:06.559 --> 01:03:08.160
dreams were like the first message board

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.280
they would they would tap you and be

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.720
like bro it's crazy you had that kind of

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.000
dude the book they're talking about like

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.760
the iowa skeros

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.079
and how like i'm sorry i would just love

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:19.119
to see like shamans competing for people

01:03:19.119 --> 01:03:20.400
out there with their stick like those

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.920
dudes with the signs like twirling it

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.599
around their neck no they do they throw

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:26.240
each other like psychic darts

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.480
this is what the movie uh was it soul

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.480
was about

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.720
yeah yeah yeah movie yeah yeah were they

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.799
throwing darts no it's like like there

01:03:34.799 --> 01:03:37.119
was a there was a dude spinning aside

01:03:37.119 --> 01:03:39.200
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah immensely

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.119
connected to the spiritual realm i like

01:03:41.119 --> 01:03:42.319
so i was like what did they have a shout

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:43.839
out wait no was it not was that soul

01:03:43.839 --> 01:03:44.960
yeah i think it was so he was yeah he

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.640
was yeah he was you're absolutely right

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.240
yeah dude they were like you'd be like

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.520
doing your thing and then you would get

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.960
a shaman who was like i'm using this

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.480
like i'm using this like for dark

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.480
purposes and i'm going to take power

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.559
you'd go into trans states get the info

01:03:56.559 --> 01:03:57.839
and then dude the guy was saying in the

01:03:57.839 --> 01:03:59.680
book he was chilling with his boy who

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.640
was actually i think called like a

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.559
tobacco era which when you were younger

01:04:02.559 --> 01:04:04.240
you would learn how to swallow tobacco

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.160
and not throw up and people would come

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.200
to you with like problems like

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.720
sicknesses and just blow smoke on them

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.640
and like you [ __ ] that tobacco tells you

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.559
where the whole book's about when people

01:04:12.559 --> 01:04:14.160
these like people from the amazon

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.280
they're like hey how'd you hear about

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.799
like doing this how did you learn how to

01:04:16.799 --> 01:04:18.640
make ayahuasca they have a bunch of like

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:19.920
plant remedies for a bunch of different

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.119
things like how did you learn about this

01:04:21.119 --> 01:04:22.640
like the plants told us they all say

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.240
that so this guy's trying to he's an

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.520
anthropologist trying to look into like

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.440
if there's any chance that that's

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.359
somewhat true yeah well it's pretty

01:04:29.359 --> 01:04:30.960
tight books you know that right now

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.319
mexico has a problem with soda shamans

01:04:34.319 --> 01:04:35.920
what's that there's soda shamans in

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.920
mexico

01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:44.000
[Laughter]

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.720
do mexico especially like the you know

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.079
like the kind of

01:04:48.079 --> 01:04:50.000
the way that mexico looks on tv parts of

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.839
it yeah where it's like dirt roads and

01:04:51.839 --> 01:04:55.119
[ __ ] they have a uh like a sugar problem

01:04:55.119 --> 01:04:57.280
right now it's because coca-cola might

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.440
be cheaper than like good water or even

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.200
if they have access to good water they

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.280
prefer coca-cola for sure so they're

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.599
living on all they're doing is drinking

01:05:05.599 --> 01:05:07.200
soda and then there's people going to

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.640
soto shamans to have like illnesses

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.920
cured by it

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.440
they'll be like here drink this

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.200
coca-cola this is going to cure you

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.559
and they're just like thank you they're

01:05:14.559 --> 01:05:17.039
dying of cancer in like on a dirt floor

01:05:17.039 --> 01:05:18.480
with no electricity and they're just
