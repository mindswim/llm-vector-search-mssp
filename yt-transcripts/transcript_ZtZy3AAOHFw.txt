George guy working the mines areas dude

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:12.600
tater scientists oh oh our potato

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.830
scientists I think I talked to you on

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:18.950
time oh maybe I don't know how bad it's

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:23.429
Ron potatoes smell like an old rotten

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:27.330
fish is something it's so bad yeah yeah

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.310
I'm potato scientist in training I'm in

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:31.020
a third year grad school baby

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.960
just a little where do you go I'll

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.490
probably not say that it's in the

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:37.880
Midwest

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:47.909
barking yeah that's good oh dude one day

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:52.110
the best program for potatoes I mean we

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.149
we got the best program I know who's got

00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:55.950
the most potatoes but their research is

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:57.690
like a little more lackluster than what

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:04.530
I'm working yeah yeah but you're a big

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:09.870
chance uh yeah I think no scientist I

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:13.980
know before I know let's stop guessing

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.620
this what what do you know hit me with

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:17.790
some about potatoes people don't know

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:21.240
about God dude how how lame do you want

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:21.550
it

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:24.430
like do you wanna blow out the sugars

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:26.890
see the sugars are so cool it's like

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.110
people talk about potatoes or starches

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:32.500
but a starch like it starch is just like

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.450
a storage thing for sugars so if the

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.100
sugars don't turn into starches they

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.770
just hang out these sugars and then over

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.350
time they turn into like she's your

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:43.690
versions of sugars and it's very cool to

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.210
me maybe not so many potato it doesn't

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.710
break down into sugar it turns into like

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.800
something else well the the sugars that

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.450
didn't turn in the starches turn into

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:58.480
worse sugars so it's bad for you

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.700
no it's just like you don't want like

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.020
you know when you get french fries with

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.090
like shitty brown spots on them that's

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:06.640
from like the good sugar is non-reducing

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.260
sure it's turned into producing sugars

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.050
is the brown are the brown spots good

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.600
for you no I mean I don't know if

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.550
they're good or bad feel but people

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.430
don't buy potatoes a good few do

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:20.470
potatoes of all the nutrients that you

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.600
yes there was the guy that just made a

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.850
[ __ ] pot roast with zero potatoes in

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:27.190
it oh dude I heard is this girls talking

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.200
Harlan told not to do it or something

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.780
how bad that piss you off as a potato I

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.120
yeah I got some baked potatoes over here

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.660
I was I was mad I wasn't happy so come

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:45.490
down to Iowa State with me do you would

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:46.510
you what do you know about the history

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.290
of sweet potatoes or you guys it's so

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:52.510
like sweet potatoes and potatoes are

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.060
different structures on the plan so

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.710
they're both what's known as Chia fights

00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:00.520
but uh like one's a modified root ones a

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.710
modified stem totally different are

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.420
sweet potatoes born that way or did they

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.880
kind of like grow into it in college all

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:13.270
right I mean I don't talk [ __ ] on sweet

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.820
potatoes they're pretty good you get

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:22.000
banned from the potato side you're all

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.500

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.280
to me you're fired

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.010
that's true yeah yeah if the potato

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.290
scientists could be pissed I saw the

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:30.680
thing you

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.180

like 400 good boys of the potato

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:48.340

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:20.570
back yeah does that thing ever get away

01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:22.400
from you the autoblow does ever like pop

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:32.690
off and like slink away yeah like it's

01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:34.460
got like a dial on it for speed so it's

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:36.920
kinda like Orchestra you just kind of so

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.600
with the highest setting is like $5

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:42.380
truckstop Hooker it kind of sneaks up on

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:44.420
you I don't think about putting like a

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.220
wig on the back of it so you can like

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:48.920
hold it down no I can't see when I got

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.080
the VR hit so long I know but for the

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.400
texture I don't know put it on the back

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.290

with the VR on you in the autoblow 2 I

01:15:16.659 --> 01:15:18.790
noticed that I was like why'd you do

01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:19.889
that

01:15:19.889 --> 01:15:35.889
tighter fit on the VR headset shot thugs

01:44:45.970 --> 01:44:49.060
bit more structure I guess yeah it's the

01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:50.320
