little brother told my other brother who

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.010
was older he was like Matt was in the

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.680
bathroom and all I heard was so he

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.910
didn't know what it was and my brother

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.530
told me and I just beat it up

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:27.650
brother [ __ ] you dude ever tell that 100

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.180
and then like two weeks later I caught

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.380
my older brother George was bent over

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.880
though I'll never forget it he was like

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.580
bent down over the bathtub his red hair

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.260
so I just see like these red pubes in

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.270
this boner and I was like I was washing

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.510

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.160
erect watch it's even worse we have a

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.160
full boner watching her I had a friend I

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.020
think we were like freshman in high

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.280
school and I called his house and when I

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.600
called his house they're like oh he's in

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.340
the shower yeah and at first I just

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.230
remembered that because when I call he'd

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.600
never showered he always smelled bad so

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.220
it stuck with me that when I called him

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.330
earlier that day he was in the shower

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.160
and then he got to my house and right

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.960
when he got to my house he was like you

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.990
mind if I get in the shower you want to

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.419

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.250
good at stand-up there's actually a

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.810
thing in the Kama Sutra that says you

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.360
should practice sex on like uglier women

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.130

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.610
1500 years ago in India I don't know

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.770

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.270

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.050
after Jesus

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.090
all right maybe before I don't know

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.310
either way imagine to say a thousand

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.380
years ago in India the guy being like

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.290
[ __ ] the ugly ones is probably like just

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.730
chicks coming out of the [ __ ] saying

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.390

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.920
he's a [ __ ] idiot I thought he was I

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.570
because whenever he's talking about [ __ ]

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.280
I don't understand I'm like uh he

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.449
probably knows what he's talking about

00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:20.970
yeah yeah but everyone smile they'll say

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.410
something that I know the answer to and

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.300
I'm just like you [ __ ] idiot that's

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.640
totally wrong that's so funny

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.140

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.170

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.770
to the road the road guna we should

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.240
start following up I was listening to

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.820
one of him and Tony Hinchcliffe and

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.110
there first off he was called him

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.080
Freddie Roosevelt was he really yeah he

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.669
was like whatever the guys name was the

00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:56.890
president Freddie Freddie Roosevelt what

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.900
is this Brogan wrote really no one in

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.980
the room could correct him a.m. and then

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.630
he was wondering why countries have

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.960
weird names he was like why do they call

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.299
like the country of Yugoslavia why is it

00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:12.730
called Yugoslavia I'm just like well

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.530
that's not a [ __ ] country you know

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.850
that is an interesting thing about him

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.260
that I think people don't realize is

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.230
that he started smoking weed like when

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.600
he was like 30 so you like when you

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.740
start smoking weed usually you're in

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.150
high school and you know that's that's

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.830
what I'd think about high school with a

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.830
little nasty old so from that I listened

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.390
to his podcast like oh this guy's just

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:32.650
starting to smoke weed so he's all these

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.600
dumb annoying pothead thoughts use a

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.220
battery system I swear to God I realized

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.929
that early on this thing I'm like he's

00:19:37.929 --> 00:19:40.090
like I do smoke weed wells like 34 I'm

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.500
like that's why you're so obsessed with

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.240
like aliens and Bigfoot at 45 years

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.590
yeah they had Alex Jones on it was

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.720

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.230

transformers when I saw the new

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.980
Transformers I thought that was Mark

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.320
Wahlberg's Boston movie

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.070
like the city blowing up this song what

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.200
are those brothers are Nev is out their

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.179
last names were brothers that did the

00:22:04.179 --> 00:22:07.299
Boston I forget I don't know take a shot

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:08.970
on that one I just know Mark Wahlberg

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.559
Mark Wahlberg stop them from doing it

00:22:11.559 --> 00:22:13.990
Wahlberg shut it down man what a [ __ ]

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.200
[ __ ] that guy is for that dude

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.429
that's only how long is the Boston it's

00:22:18.429 --> 00:22:20.710
been what two and a half years maybe if

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.990
they're happy maybe longer three years

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:27.159
max since the Boston bombing yeah I

00:22:27.159 --> 00:22:27.669
don't know

00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:30.220
it hasn't been that long that was like

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.840
who the [ __ ] bought the rights to

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.389
Bradley Cooper he read the American

00:22:34.389 --> 00:22:35.529
sniper book and like you can't make a

00:22:35.529 --> 00:22:36.730
music I don't care I'm buying the rights

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.350
I'm being this guy and it's like are you

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.279
[ __ ] psycho

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:41.230
yeah that's weird it's just like

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.139
Wolverine if he was on one of the lines

00:22:44.139 --> 00:22:45.789
at 9/11 you just stopped it I'll give

00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:47.490
Wahlberg that he probably would have I

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.049
think he would have [ __ ] freaked out

00:22:50.049 --> 00:22:52.600
I don't think Wahlberg would allow that

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.460
dude have you played those many action

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.830
heroes he's in his head like I'm gonna

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.419
grab the go and kick him I yeah I

00:22:58.419 --> 00:22:59.860
believe him on that one they didn't know

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.120
they were going to crash into a building

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.230
yeah but they don't they knew they're

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.519
being hijacked they knew they're being

00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:08.049
hijacked so it's like alright let's see

00:23:08.049 --> 00:23:09.429
where they take us and no ransom us

00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:11.019
which is what they told the passengers

00:23:11.019 --> 00:23:12.639
apparently I think Wahlberg would have

00:23:12.639 --> 00:23:14.559
attacked well I think it was all because

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.990
of that one plane did yeah and that's

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:18.700
what happened on flight 93 because when

was just gonna say [ __ ] yeah

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.670

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.240
no this is what I want to talk

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.030
[ __ ] uh that [ __ ] hidden figures

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:06.200
movie [ __ ] hilarious that is hidden

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.540
figures I didn't see it but I can I mean

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.309
I knew it I knew what the [ __ ] it was

00:33:10.309 --> 00:33:12.550
yeah I knew exactly what it was yeah

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.760
so I [ __ ] just looked it up because I

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.809
described it is about it's basically the

00:33:17.809 --> 00:33:21.370
lady like the base black ladies that

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:24.220
things called black ladies go to space

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.300
called Madea goes

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.650
[Laughter]

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:33.260
now the movie is a black women of the

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.850
smartest and a bunch of white dudes try

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:39.460
to stop them from being smart yeah and

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.870
no what was she she was like a great

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:43.309
mathematician yet

00:33:43.309 --> 00:33:45.530
physics she helped figure it out they

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.880
paint the movie out like they're like

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.320
get off my coffeepot

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.540
don't touch my [ __ ] yeah so there's

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.710
there's a scene in the movie where

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.510
apparently she has to walk like a mile

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.860
and a half to go somewhere else to use

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.929
the bathroom because she can't and then

00:33:56.929 --> 00:33:59.290
I looked it up and that's totally untrue

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:02.240
NASA did not have like that's her whites

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.860
only part in the movie - that's like

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.690
them one of the main yeah controversy

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:08.149
walking in the rain' plane like after

00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:10.580
yeah and watch the rain like we're gonna

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:18.020
stop we go industry now they don't go to

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.550
the moon isn't that about a she's

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.350
sending a John Glenn sending hot guy to

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.210
do Todd is [ __ ] movie Glenn is hops

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:25.250
the hottest guy it's like I'm going the

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.600
Guru tree pick and he's like I'm the

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.700
hottest let me just died they really

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.210
died like two three or think but yeah

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.030
you orbited the earth right I don't get

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.220
all the way around okay the thing

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.450
started burning up it was like in the

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:40.790
movie her exact figure was what like got

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.010
him safely um the only thing that's true

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:45.139
about that is before the launch he did

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:48.440
request that she looks at it yeah but it

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.990
wasn't like day of like it isn't a movie

00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:53.060
it's literally like he's about to blast

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.560
off he's like what did she say she's

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.270
like yeah and that's whatever that's

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.609
Hollywood magic you're saying yeah they

00:34:58.609 --> 00:35:00.980
battle was they added racism to that

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.109
movie that's affected exist yeah there

00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:04.609
was like don't drink my coffee pot it

00:35:04.609 --> 00:35:06.350
was like her on the bed and like Kevin

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.090
Costner busts out like a sledge hammers

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.950
like destroys the [ __ ] sign whites

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:11.840
only signed yet that's no that's true

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.770
dude no is

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:14.360
banging [ __ ] around at NASA like it

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.440
they're like putting holes in walls and

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.510
[ __ ] yeah just do that and these are all

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:20.570
[ __ ] scientists and physics and all

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.130
these [ __ ] got like you think they're

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:25.220
gonna be like no [ __ ] coloreds yeah

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.350
exactly they all went to college they're

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:29.960
like liberal [ __ ] that's funny it was

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.730
just funny to see them add to racism

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:34.310
yeah that's [ __ ] insane like I

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.760
watched when I watched [ __ ] Django

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.120
yeah and even uh was the other one the

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.280
absolute no no not that one

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.470
the one he just came out with Tarantino

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:47.180
I didn't see it it's good it's really

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.650
good but they said the n-word every

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.330
other [ __ ] word no like constantly

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.310
and I was I can't believe that one no if

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:53.870
you look it up it's like they didn't

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.060
really know they were they didn't do

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.250
that like historically they didn't say

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.020
topic and word every other [ __ ] word

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.150
really and I and it's just a weird

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.470
I mean he's not trying to be

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.990
historically accurate it also I don't

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:07.480
think there's any historical

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.880
documentation of mandingo fighting you

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.380
know what in Django and they a black

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.480
black boy to the death I could see them

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.180
doing that they I don't think there's

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.370
any records of that huh so it's kind of

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:21.470
like yeah white guys are evil yeah I

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:24.200
could see us doing that yeah but it's

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.640
hard like do you think like a [ __ ]

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.470
German watch think about me I mean this

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:29.480
is this is [ __ ] the thing about like

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.670
me and my cousins you guys would have

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:34.100
never owned slaves tell me we're - we

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.090
would've been too poor in our lineage

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:37.940
yeah I'm saying sabers of population in

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.710
the United States that owned slaves yes

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.260
yeah I really look exactly but I'm

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.680
saying like just being bored down and

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.090
like the by you you have all these

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:48.590
slaves like you don't think I get him to

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:51.950
fight I don't think I guess you wouldn't

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.870
to hurt them you know I mean yeah I mean

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.700
it's a weird thing where a lot of those

00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:01.660
guys like oddly enough treated them well

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:05.030
not well but not well no yeah I know I

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.640
know it's not what I'm saying is it's

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.190
not like this [ __ ] like we're gonna

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.710
vote and kill them yeah yeah yeah I mean

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.750
don't get me wrong that happened but not

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.730
to the level of like every [ __ ]

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.520
Hollywood movie is like yeah I don't

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.320
know and a lot of that too is like in

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.210
order to tell a good you know yeah poor

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.070
story of course yeah again it's funny

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:26.670
because it puts you in a position of

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:28.570
it's one thing if you're telling you're

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:30.280
writing an original screenplay when

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.750
you're like based off true events and

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.750
you're like just adding [ __ ] yeah and

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:35.980
have you guys said there's a white day

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.780
to be like you know what I don't think

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.570
was that bad you can't say that exactly

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.250
it was like like it why didn't you

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:43.930
imagine like a German watching

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.700
Schindler's List I mean like man happy

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.220
to do that about that part it just added

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.800
one part to make us worse it's we don't

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.840
need it but yeah like in [ __ ] hidden

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.910
figures like do we really need that yeah

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:56.680
do we need her to walk to the [ __ ]

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.810
whites only her color only bathroom they

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.430
did though that we need that was like

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.830
the main thing like otherwise that movie

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:04.830
wasn't boring it's [ __ ] yeah just like

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.300
handle these numbers and she's like okay

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.500
and then she like was really good at it

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.020
they didn't hide her she's it's all

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.050
documented what she did that's funny

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.490
there's a [ __ ] wing at NASA named

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:17.650
after yeah like it wasn't like this big

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:20.320
[ __ ] we can't let him know we have

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.180
blacks doing it no they weren't hiding

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.500
or they're just like Bossin her and

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.270
being like you classified you can't see

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.100
it then she'd like see it Geely hold up

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.450
to light and see through like the black

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.790
marker and then she do I solve the

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:32.860
problem they'd be like oh okay

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.600
I'm knocking down this goddamn sign

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.210
what's wrong yeah it's kind of Remember

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.130
the Titans ish like the guy I'm saying

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.040
though that is going that's the next I'm

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.210
not going to say billion-dollar industry

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:44.980
but that's a like there is a there's

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.160
definitely a white-guilt industry it's

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.110
not next it's already there yeah but I'm

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:51.040
say it's going to get bigger and bigger

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.840
and bigger like go to Whole Foods and

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.390
that that place is like buy soap with

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:56.920
like a little like dying African kid

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.090
it's like you can help them with like

00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:59.560
two cents to his village and people like

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.960
okay it's just like this weird thing you

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.910
can you can find a white person to make

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.320
them feel less evil you can be a rich

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.280
man I think that's been around since

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.890
like [ __ ] the movie glory like it's

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:14.170
been a long time saying it's getting

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:16.330
like there's there's like things now I

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:18.730
saw an online test to like you can take

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:21.010
quizzes to see how racist you are man

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.990
and then like try to act how to tone it

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:25.390
down and it's [ __ ] crazy man like

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:26.650
there's gonna be like a racism

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.480
specialist in like 10 years who will

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.250
like go to shows and be like all right

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.500
what do you think about this like do our

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.630
Asians do agents talk funny like yes

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.210
like no no you can't well

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.600
I mean I can't say but I'd be like it's

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.180
sane to have someone to be like I tested

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.760
you you came up positive for racism I'm

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.180
an alright yeah it's funny too because

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.330
that's how the outside world likes views

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.040
America like because the only thing they

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.480
get they're not reading history like

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.220
other countries are just watching movies

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.840
that's true and they're like wow wow

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.820
white guys are horrible over they do

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.170
what other countries are watching that

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:05.280
saying it give her here about unit 731

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.560
no it was a [ __ ] man it's it's a real

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.550
thing it's not like a wild conspiracy

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:12.550
thing but it was like the Japanese at

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.570
one point I think when they're like

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:15.430
occupying China do they occupy China the

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:16.090
Second World War

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:17.530
yeah they set up this thing called unit

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.900
731 where they're doing experiments on

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.580
like citizens and there was like chop

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.350
people's arms off and I see how long it

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:24.550
took him to die and like freeze their

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:25.960
limbs they're cutting them open and

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.420
seeing like how long the body oh I mean

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.850
like other countries yeah yeah yeah

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:32.230
they're feeding them like by like

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.910
diseases and [ __ ] and it comes the wood

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:34.300
man

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.820
oh [ __ ] I should end it yeah we're out

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.710

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.200
get it was good take a second break then

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.680
we'll come back alright

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.530
and we're Oh took a little break Matt

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:50.200
showed me a nice nice video that what's

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.360
like what's that online Mike Mike so

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.920
it's called yeah the title of this video

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.130
was are all white people racists yes of

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:00.970
course but let me explain it is just how

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:04.420
white people will uh suck basically it

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.190
was just a title it's classic it

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.200
explains like biases that all people

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.810

00:43:42.579 --> 00:43:44.739

being like I don't like abortion it's

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.650
like 50% of the country being like or

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:17.660
