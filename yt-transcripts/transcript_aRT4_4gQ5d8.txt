something you throw a piece of paper out

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.500
it doesn't mean you failed at writing it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.610

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.020

how much like when you're doing stand-up

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.040
you don't even realize it but from being

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.020
in the spotlight you're in control of

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.300

no it's true there's a pressure on you

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.450
and when someone's else steps up on the

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.650
