if you slice a boner let me tell you

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.440
something i've never sliced a boner this

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.080
is the first time i sliced the boner bro

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.360
dude it was a catastrophe

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.400
it was

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.519
all over the hotel room all over

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.319
but

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.840
you know what you ever you ever damage

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.519
your penis when you're whacking off

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.360
yes we all have

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.800
friction you've never damaged yeah

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.040
friction yeah like a severe burn where

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.560
it's like that was too hard

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.319
so i've damaged that and then it doesn't

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.640
hurt until you're done until you're done

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.920
right and then when you're done you're

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.879
like ow birds so this slice didn't hurt

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.200
what and she was i would i kept trying

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.159
to go

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.440
and she was like no i definitely

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.599
scratched it because i didn't see it

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.879
and then she was like no i definitely

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.040
scratched you and i looked and i had in

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.599
my hand it was just so much blood dude

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.519
wasn't that a fun start

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.959
it's the underneath the shaft

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.680
so the bottom of my penis is sliced

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.720
that's a good way like was the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.879
underbelly coming apart like literally

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.959
like it's a little bit sliced

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.400
blade it's a flayed penis

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.680
you're like the dudes you got uh what

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.959

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.280
it's not a circumcision it's called a uh

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.879
that when they caught those aboriginal

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.959
australians it's sub-incision you got

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.200
sub-incised yes it's a rite of passage

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.879
it is a rite of passage i do feel

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.560
stronger open up yeah do you know if you

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.480

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.560
no once i once i saw the blood i it

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.400
quickly changed to a panic

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.239
yeah yeah and she obviously she was

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.760

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.880
doggy so i was

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.000
[Laughter]

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.919
this is just good easy listening the

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.479
neighbors heard the neighbors probably

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.160
are you screaming did you hear me yelp

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.479
no i i didn't i didn't make a noise dude

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.400
you can't talk silent assassin in the

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.280
bedroom

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.400
so you got slicing you're just like

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.319
i'm what you're trying to get

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.039
oh man

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:44.319
i can't believe i've admitted to having

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.319
a slice penis on this podcast

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.080
you were curled up just like like i

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.440
pulled jackson off the tilt every now

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.800
and again he just still goes yeah

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.840
i would think it would heal quick

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.639
bro

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.720
why not i would think the body would be

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.319
it's never been fine-tuned it's like a

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.919
baby's hand it's never you're not

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.400
working with your penis right it's fresh

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.319
baby skin yeah dude it [ __ ] heals

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:07.840
super fast i think it might heal super

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.840
fast yeah i've had damaged penis before

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.479
and it does heal quickly never a slice

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:13.199
but

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.520
you can't have a penis down for too long

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.919
that's a that's an emergency

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:10.640
so i had to take the antibiotics for

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.079
chlamydia and he gave me a shot for

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:13.600
syphilis as well

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.079
jesus and then it took more than a week

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:17.519
to get the results back i was waiting

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:20.000
like two weeks and my penis still hurt

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.680
so i texted the girl i was sleeping with

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.079
i was like you gave me chlamydia and she

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:25.519
was like [ __ ] you dude i don't have

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:27.040
chlamydia and that was a big fight and

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.720
she hasn't she didn't talk to me after

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.519
that

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:30.959
the doctor called me back the next day

00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:32.560
and was like you don't have chlamydia or

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.079
syphilis by the way was it burning would

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:35.600
you like sting and burn when you peed

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.200
yeah he said and then he said it was

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.200
probably just from too much too much use

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.880
again

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.880

well the reason he was calling people

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.760
anti-football [ __ ] is because it was

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.919

people like ran a simulation like five

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.320
years ago and talking about how we would

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.159
suppress that yeah if there were an

00:31:34.159 --> 00:31:35.120
event how would we suppress

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.039
disinformation yeah rather than like

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:38.320

him apparently apparently he says it was

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.480
from a vaccine

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.600

you a [ __ ] hippie

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.159
i remember that remember years and years

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:15.840
ago i was like they're positioning for a

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.760
new trillion dollar industry

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.960
and you know they're getting it and they

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.240
deserve it and they should have it you

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.200
know

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.480
they should all do what they say and if

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.760
you disagree

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.279
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] dude you're a

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:26.880
threat to our democracy

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.440
to our health yeah i just hope all those

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.440
people get the justice

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.200
that tried to storm and overturn the

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.720
entire government remember that the

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.360
justice that they deserve justice

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.799
we need to rat those people out that

00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:40.840
stormed the capitol and attempted a coup

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.679
yeah it all starts with

00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:45.919
finding homophobic emails that's where

00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:47.440
you find that's like the [ __ ]

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.159
breeding ground for anti my penis stings

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:52.480
right now

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.559
god but yeah man

00:32:56.559 --> 00:32:58.000
i think that's true i think i think

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.840
we're safer as a country now that gruden

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.320
is not in charge of these

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.360
las vegas raiders

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.120
now dude the network they did they did

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.640
not cut the head off the snake with that

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.399
if they were winning if the raiders i

00:33:10.399 --> 00:33:11.440
know they're having a good year right

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.360
now but if that was like a long term

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.720
they won for like if that happened to

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.640
bill belichick the patriots would be

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.159
like no

00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:20.720

belichick's like kind of now that

00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:24.240
brady's gone i think he could he could

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.480
succumb to it yeah but

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.080
i bet they would have i bet if it was

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.279
like new england and they were winning

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:30.320
the height of this

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.320

part of some marine base they had some

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.520
separate island for like the most

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.440

00:57:26.319 --> 00:57:27.920
the only cartoonists

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.440

propelled his career

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.640
uh or no uh he's he's like he has very

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.799
strong views against um

00:57:40.799 --> 00:57:43.760
oh wait was he dilbert yeah he loved

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.000

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.839
he did he like tried he was tr he tried

00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:49.280
to he did like a weird thing where he's

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.799
like i don't love trump but you have to

00:57:50.799 --> 00:57:52.880
understand he's into his art he's

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:54.640
powerful yeah yeah he's a big into

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.720
persuasion extremely powerful he knows

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.799
exactly what he's doing all the time

00:57:58.799 --> 00:58:01.040
yeah big into persuasion he was he was

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.400
like he did

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.240
i mean that's what that's what he kept

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.280
coming back

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.799
how can you argue look at the results

00:58:06.799 --> 00:58:08.319
that's the real problem with you guys

00:58:08.319 --> 00:58:10.000
the the real catch point too with the

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000
left is like is he a nincompoop or is he

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.319
orchestrating a coup and destroying the

00:58:16.319 --> 00:58:20.240
democracy 22 with the left is nothing

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:23.280
they do is cool

00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:25.599
everything they do is not cool

00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:26.880
i'll tell you what you're guys having a

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.799
tough time right now in the polls and

00:58:28.799 --> 00:58:30.880
everything republicans do is kind of

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.960
cool well no it didn't used to be that

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.400
way you leave me alone it didn't used to

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.559
be that it didn't be until you guys

00:58:36.559 --> 00:58:37.839
really started shoving it down

00:58:37.839 --> 00:58:39.440
everyone's throat all you guys had to do

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.960
for a while was just like now you can

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.160
get abortions and everyone's like yeah

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.720
it's sensible and now you guys [ __ ]

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:46.559
lost it it's too it's i haven't i have a

00:58:46.559 --> 00:58:49.680
theory trump was like a cia shock

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:50.480
i could have just completely

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.319
destabilized the country

00:58:52.319 --> 00:58:54.000
i when he first came in i was like dude

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.599
i think this is part of a larger

00:58:55.599 --> 00:58:57.359
orchestra i think he's just a rogue wave

00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:58.880
i don't think it was orchestrated i

00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:00.400
think it's just i think he just is what

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.640
happens with our media yeah and with

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.000
everything i don't think it was like

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.359
they sat down and we're like let's do

00:59:05.359 --> 00:59:07.040
this i think just anytime something that

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.680
polarizing comes out with today's

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.960
the way we're set up it's going to

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.559
destroy everything that's very possible

00:59:12.559 --> 00:59:14.160
i think that's significantly i don't

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.760
think they've been able no they're true

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.960
i'm saying it's very possible that i'm

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.960
wrong what i'm saying is

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.359
he created the perfect conditions for us

00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:22.880
to have you know and rightfully so i'm

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.319
glad we've had all of our constitutional

00:59:24.319 --> 00:59:26.480
rights stripped away yeah but i think i

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.559
think he set up the perfect conditions

00:59:28.559 --> 00:59:30.160
for that to happen

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:30.960
yeah

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.720
but again fight back but that was just

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.720
because exactly what would happen with

00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:37.760
this media because if one

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.200
bully got yeah i guess so i guess yeah i

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.040
guess the media had killed on him a

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.559
little yeah it wouldn't have been that

00:59:42.559 --> 00:59:44.400
polarizing no that's a fair point they

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.599
would have just passed they made

00:59:45.599 --> 00:59:47.760
everybody cry did you see the video of

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.079
him chris and all his friends cried

00:59:50.079 --> 00:59:51.520
i did not cry

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.280
on election night i did not cry you came

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:56.160
close i was upset democracy is dead as

00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.599
we know it

00:59:57.599 --> 01:00:00.839
big one

01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:11.920
[Laughter]

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.359
they were just quietly passing that

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:14.799
stuff before that was a funny thing they

01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:16.480
were just quietly past all kinds of wild

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.799
[ __ ] yeah that's what snowden got like

01:00:18.799 --> 01:00:20.160
that was this big moment when they were

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.599
like you know the government can read

01:00:21.599 --> 01:00:23.119
all your texts everyone's like what they

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.720
said yeah we passed the bill

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.000
stop crying we're gonna read your text

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.920
so i guess you don't have to destabilize

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.400
yeah yeah they can do it some other way

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.559
maybe it was just the swing from obama

01:00:32.559 --> 01:00:33.599
you know i was like everyone got to be

01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:36.880
pumped on obama and then they're like

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.799
in front of you no trump just like you

01:00:38.799 --> 01:00:40.480
can't take i mean with that clip the

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.480
other day was the funniest thing

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.200
no no the one where he was uh looking at

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.599
that sleeping guy speech

01:00:47.599 --> 01:00:49.680
it's just like there's some dude at a

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.040
speech i don't know where he's from

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.359
turkey or something yeah he muslim and

01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:54.160
he's

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.640
egypt afghanistan

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.480
somebody else was giving a speech all

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.760
these world leaders are on stage and

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.599
there's a muslim guy

01:01:05.599 --> 01:01:07.119
the camera pulls back and trumps just

01:01:07.119 --> 01:01:09.280
like

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.680
like a dad in church like what the [ __ ]

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.920
are you doing

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.200
i thought you said it was doing a trump

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.119
rally a middle eastern guy passed out

01:01:17.119 --> 01:01:19.359
like slap no no no you think you'd be on

01:01:19.359 --> 01:01:20.400
[ __ ]

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.000
it's something

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.280
yeah as they're paying to the right

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.720
melania's sitting there just staring

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.280
straight ahead motionless it just gets

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.720
to his face

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.760
and it is the funniest scowl

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.599
it's scousing the only way that trump

01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:34.400
can't

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.240
yeah you think he'll be back

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.240
i think so i think he's going to storm

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.640
back 2024. oh you're dropping

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.240
breadcrumbs you think the storm's coming

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.599
i think so

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:45.599
how could he not be doing q-drops bro

01:01:45.599 --> 01:01:47.440
he's still got the heat

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.160
yeah he's the only one that can

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.680
no one can beat him but like what are

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.079
they even beating what are they doing

01:01:54.079 --> 01:01:55.440
well i'm saying like there's no other

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.680
republican that'll be able to

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.760
get the nomination over him yeah and

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.760
then

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.440
that is because there's a whole middle

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.960
ground of people that don't give a [ __ ]

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.880
about politics that want trump to win

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.480
yeah you know

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.799
whoever those people are yeah

01:02:10.799 --> 01:02:13.200
true i don't want to win yeah

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.799
i don't know what else of america i

01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:16.240
genuinely don't don't know what i want

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.760
right now in terms of him coming do i

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.799
want to deal with it yeah i don't want

01:02:18.799 --> 01:02:20.000
to do it four more years of hearing

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.280
about it to deal with that but then

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.039
again it's the same thing as last time

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:24.880
and we've said this a million times but

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.039
it's like do i want to deal with him

01:02:27.039 --> 01:02:29.680
no but do i want the left to get their

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.440
way after they stomped and cried for

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.680
four years i also don't want that which

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.520
that's them winning us all being like i

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.200
don't want to deal with this again is us

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.240
being like i don't want to deal with the

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.760
left being [ __ ]

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.319
giant [ __ ] no nothing anti-football

01:02:42.319 --> 01:02:45.039
[ __ ] true for four more [ __ ] years

01:02:45.039 --> 01:02:47.440
the left is anti-football

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.200
yeah i would say i'm telling you matthew

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.520
mcconaughey i think it's going to be a i

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.119
think it's going to be a classic it's

01:02:53.119 --> 01:02:55.119
going to be kamala trump

01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:56.640
it's going to be a classic yeah and

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.000
she's not even going to be close to him

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.720
that would be a bloody [ __ ] disaster

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.319
if they try to run her

01:03:04.319 --> 01:03:05.760
yeah definitely not and they might

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.119
because they have to

01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:08.880
yeah they have to by their own rules

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.640
that they've created they have to elect

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.559
a woman of color biden's just got a limp

01:03:12.559 --> 01:03:13.680
into that

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.880

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.760
trying to say he [ __ ] himself yes when

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.680
everyone rushes out of the right guy you

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.280
told me about it i gotta see everything

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.559
i was looking for i was looking for

01:03:24.559 --> 01:03:26.799
chris doesn't watch biden it's not like

01:03:26.799 --> 01:03:28.839
chris refuses to look at himself in the

worse under his leadership over the

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.079
course of like 30 years and then it

01:04:40.079 --> 01:04:41.839

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.520
working hard he picks up to make some

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.039

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.280
a spot like that what the [ __ ] your

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.279
problem dude

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:18.719
yo speaking of getting put on the spot i

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:20.719
was watching this interview with uh ben

01:08:20.719 --> 01:08:22.640
and jerry's did you guys see that at all

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.560
i saw it it's so funny why they don't

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.319
support israel it was something about

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.719
like their anti-israel uh they're

01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:30.319
they're pro-israel but they're against

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:32.159
like israel's policies so i think they

01:08:32.159 --> 01:08:33.600
were going to stop sending ice cream

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.560
there

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.359
so the girl was just like

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:39.359
aren't you guys big on like voting laws

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:40.880
and abortion why don't you stop selling

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.880
the taxes in georgia and he's like

01:08:47.199 --> 01:08:49.839
that's a good question

01:08:49.839 --> 01:08:51.040
he was like well we're not gonna just

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.400
stop selling

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.560
like those are our country yeah ice

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:55.520
cream

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.880
yeah it was pretty funny for him to get

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.719
hit with that question yeah and just be

01:08:58.719 --> 01:08:59.759
like

01:08:59.759 --> 01:09:01.359
and the other guys i don't know which

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:03.040
one ben or jerry i don't know which one

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.880
doesn't talk they've got a real pen and

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.560
teller thing going on

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.400
yeah one of them doesn't talk

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.080
damn dude just sat there like looking at

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.319
the other guy like don't [ __ ] this up

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:13.679
dude what are you going to say they did

01:09:13.679 --> 01:09:15.120
a blockade on the jays dude yeah they

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.080
hit them

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.080
how much ice cream do you think the jews

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.000
eat yeah do they eat a lot of 25 percent

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.359
of the world's

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:23.040
you think so i don't know do you think

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.199
they got a stranglehold on ice cream

01:09:25.199 --> 01:09:27.839
they probably eat ben and jerry jews i

01:09:27.839 --> 01:09:29.520
actually i think jews

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.040
typically have

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.960
[ __ ] up stomachs and react to dairy

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.520
poorly so and asian people too asian

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.359
people don't tolerate the right house i

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:39.600
could see that yeah

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.779
yeah because they didn't

01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:44.719
[Laughter]

01:09:44.719 --> 01:09:47.520
we the the you know the whites

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.359
did we were we were the first to do the

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:50.880
milk and [ __ ]

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.640
no we talking about this

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.600
stop stealing the stuff from the

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.040
africans do your cult your appropriate i

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:55.840
don't know

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.679
no the milk and stuff i would imagine

01:09:57.679 --> 01:10:00.000
like that was middle east

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.560
north africa

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.120

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.719
the romans had ice that was something we

01:11:18.719 --> 01:11:20.000
got called out on

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.040
really how the [ __ ] did they get all

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.400
that ice in the show it's [ __ ] the

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.560
romans apparently they bury it right

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.960
you bury

01:11:30.159 --> 01:11:31.920
a long time yeah you know about that and

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.080
sand huh yeah

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.159
these are two things i know about that's

01:11:36.159 --> 01:11:38.159
what they used to do they would bury ice

01:11:38.159 --> 01:11:40.400
in the ground because the ground is uh

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.400
cold it's chilly down there or it's

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.880
stable temperature yeah geothermal and

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.480
you pack it all together back into the

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.840
little room every day in harrisburg they

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.320
used to chop the ice right off the river

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.800
yeah yeah really the iceman would come

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.600
around

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.360
card around some blocks

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.679
they still do that in uh poor countries

01:11:57.679 --> 01:12:00.080
i'm sure no they do it in new hampshire

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.760
well you can go up there for an ice

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.600
cutting you just cut big cubes ice out

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.120
of them nice how many people you think

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.560

hitting the [ __ ] lake

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.679
i think you can only do a deep winter to

01:12:13.679 --> 01:12:15.280
get big chunks

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.640
