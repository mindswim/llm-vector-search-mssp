00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.319
trying to dose you you do have you have

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.480
way too much proximity to evil hippies

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.840
yeah because that's like that's their

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.519
only threat if you deal with like rogue

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.599
hippies they constantly threaten each

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.200
other by giving each other mega doses of

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.640
acid because most of them are kind of

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.560
[ __ ] yeah so they won't like fight

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.159

this for a long time and they won't ever

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.200

00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:40.000
gay man but he was adamant that his rent

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.679
wasn't homophobic

00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:42.559

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.600
much money so he might just because look

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.080

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.960
of a lot of internet uh

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.320
dude there's definitely a little the

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.480
breeze is blowing man because there's a

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.000
lot of the internet personalities a

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.200
couple of them that i follow are

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.200
starting to like double down real hard

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.440
on uh on like the right baby jimmy

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.760
gaffigan came out hard on what he got

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.400
he unleashed fury on trump man did he

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.679
yeah what do you say and people were

00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:47.279

00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:48.640
the man what do you say that's the boy

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.520

all right yeah man he seemed legit i

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:00.480
don't know why

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.840
well i guess because he never said it

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.520
ever until now but gaffigans seemed

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.120
i don't know usually i'm very critical

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.880
if i think somebody's being phony or

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.120
like virtue signaling his seemed legit i

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.799
guess you'd have to see it

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.880
yeah did he do the hot pocket voice at

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.600
all

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.120
i was thinking that too where it's like

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.200
it's such a hard thing to be like we

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.440
need to come together as a country

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.480
hey i like that guy

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.880
that's my president hey mister why i

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.799
just i don't uh

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.120
that was people with the

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.640
song like vendors for the wedding and

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.240
they're like you know everything will be

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.919
cool once we get we just need to get uh

00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:43.360

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.679
there who can handle a pandemic oh

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:46.640
that's because they were talking your

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.640
wife

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.559

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.960
honk had to defund the police thing on

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.000
her thing and she called her and was

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.919
like you're fired oh i don't want that

00:27:57.919 --> 00:27:59.200
kind of [ __ ] around

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.039
she fired her that's right well i don't

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.760
she's part of the thin blue line but

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.840
yeah man the uh but she was talking to

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.679
someone and they're like well once we

00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:15.600
once we have you know this in here then

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.039
we'll be able to handle the pandemic but

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:18.320
it's like

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.799
dude you [ __ ] like making cakes what

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.080
are you you don't have any idea what

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.120
you're talking people just like

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.320
literally hearing [ __ ] online and

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.320
reciting i'm trying so hard to

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.360
[ __ ]

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.840
not do anything like not be a part of

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.039
any of it yeah like just totally like i

00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:35.760
i can't i can't do it yeah i'm easily

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.159
swayed by [ __ ] exactly i look at [ __ ]

00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:39.200
i'm like all right well that's how i

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.200
feel right now and then i recite it to

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.000
somebody and they're like you're a

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.720
[ __ ] idiot i'm like

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.640
i guess i'm this again

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.760
all right

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.080
i don't like the way that's going but

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.360
the cdc is saying that 94 of the cova

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.559
deaths

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:56.559
were from were also they also had

00:28:56.559 --> 00:28:59.360
underlying issues so 94 percent really

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.159
yeah so only six percent of people died

00:29:02.159 --> 00:29:04.159
exclusively

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:05.600
but one of the underlying issues it's

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.120
not like this is new information this

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.279
has been out the whole time but somehow

00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:11.600
i didn't know that 94 included in that

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.600
are heart attacks

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.279
i didn't hear and [ __ ] like that yeah so

00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:17.120
like just if you die and have coveted

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.399
you're part of the

00:29:18.399 --> 00:29:20.080
i'm trying to figure out how we have it

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.000
so bad and everybody's like because we

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.760
didn't handle it obviously i think we

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.440
[ __ ] up handling it but like if you

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.120
look at other countries like germany

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.240
france

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.080
england they're all at like zero to

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.960
[ __ ] like five deaths yeah a day now

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.679
yeah and we're still at like a thousand

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:36.640
mm-hmm

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.760
i don't know so

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.799
you know what i'd have to look into i'd

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:41.120
like to see how many nursing homes they

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.279
have

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:44.320
you know maybe that's like a cultural

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.840
thing in america where we sent geezers

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.279
to nursing homes where that's like

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:48.640
totally acceptable maybe in those other

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.399
countries it's not yeah because the

00:29:50.399 --> 00:29:52.080
nursing homes have to make up half of

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.320
our deaths yeah because nursing homes

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.919
nursing clubs are just getting [ __ ]

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:58.320
crushed absolutely it's just kind of

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.919
funny i don't know why i don't know why

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:00.880
it's funny

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.640
i don't know why it's pretty [ __ ] up

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.919
it's funny that everybody was like all

00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:05.360
right let's lock our old people

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.799
maybe the most uneventful i mean i've

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:08.320
never worked in one but every time i've

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.000
been like around one i think i've been

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.159
in them a couple times they seem very

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:14.640
very very very uneventful so they have

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.919
like a negative

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:17.440
untrained eye dude they were all [ __ ]

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.279
each other true true that but they're

00:30:19.279 --> 00:30:21.600
getting like beat occasionally yeah dude

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.039
people got to lay down the line dude on

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:24.159
them a couple you know you got a little

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:26.000
the order laser come in and [ __ ] you up

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.240
dude imagine someone bio-weaponed them

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.159
i think one of the tiny bio-weapon dart

00:30:30.159 --> 00:30:32.000
geezers do you think so

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.679
because i was reading a thing about uh

00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:35.279
the jews and the concentration camps

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:36.880
would take leicester and they would go

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.080
when they would do the germans

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.840
they would do the germans uniforms and

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.000
they would pop lice oh get some of that

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.399
plague yeah so i'm up in there but the

00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:47.840
um

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.440
i guess you would call that crafty

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.480
i don't it's a word i would use for that

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.320
well yeah they did uh when people sit

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.000
here like they handled the pandemic

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.360
wrong it's like

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.080
okay dude who barely works 40 hours a

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.919
week what what where do they drop the

00:31:03.919 --> 00:31:05.919
ball on this global pandemic yeah i

00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:07.360
don't know well they should attempt dude

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.559
now they're saying they're testing too

00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:09.760
much well they should have tested okay

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.200
fine they're rolling out tests and

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.720
they're like well now people are testing

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.840
too much people are getting false

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.200
confidence it's like dude these are two

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.880
people trying to just

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.720
uh sway the public concessions i just

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.240
don't understand it that's not good

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.000
either i just don't get it

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.799
yeah if i was if i was like so like

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:26.480
severely immunocompromised i would say

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.159
to [ __ ] him i would stay inside

00:31:28.159 --> 00:31:30.640
but i would chill we gotta look up

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.039
and i should have done this before

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:34.000
what

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.159
i have it uh

00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:38.159
before i just you know talked about it

00:31:38.159 --> 00:31:39.519
but it's like

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:41.279
i don't know what did france and germany

00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:43.279
do and like they locked down right away

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:44.640
i looked up when they locked down and

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.880
when they close schools yeah and it's

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.960
almost exactly what we did

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.320
maybe they were better at it than we

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.240
were in sweden so we didn't hardly did

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.919
it barely and now the narrative is

00:31:53.919 --> 00:31:54.960
they're getting crushed right now i

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.120
looked it up they're not yeah

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.080
i don't know

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.840
and now the narrative is also the south

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:00.480
is

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.080
they never locked up and they're [ __ ]

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.840
it up for all of us which is the you

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.279

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:07.519
people in new york acted oh my god dude

00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:09.360

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.000
stalingrad it's [ __ ] crazy like you

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.080

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.039
hell

00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:16.000
it's like

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.919
you stayed inside yeah what do you think

00:32:17.919 --> 00:32:19.440

i cheered for nurses at 7 pm

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.480
every day

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.360
until

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.399
race riots and then it felt weird

00:32:30.399 --> 00:32:32.399

immune from this in kenosha

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.360
wisconsin so where is kenosha what was

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.039
like the layout of it

00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:18.880
i don't know it must be close to

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.399
illinois

00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:21.919
i believe because that's where that kyle

00:33:21.919 --> 00:33:23.679
kid's from yeah and the big thing is

00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:26.320
he's not even from that state but

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.399
it is 12 miles away

00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:31.200
so it must be on the border yeah

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.039
so he went down there and it's where was

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:34.559
it wisconsin it must be by milwaukee

00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:37.120
it's in wisconsin is it near milwaukee

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.039
if there's a black dude there fairly it

00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:42.799
has to be near a city right yeah

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.200
that's not wrong to say

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.200
it's between chicago and milwaukee like

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.360
right in the middle of it all right

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.840
so it's like a diverse

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.440
suburb and he was just like he was like

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.200
i gotta get down kyle was like i need to

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.480
go defend

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.159
the [ __ ] pep boys i gotta go down

00:33:58.159 --> 00:33:59.840
there yeah defend these mom and pop

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.840
shops i gotta defend the walmart yeah so

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.360
then he went down

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.399
and uh

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:06.000
from what i don't know i the only thing

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.919
i saw was like him

00:34:07.919 --> 00:34:09.839
talking about like overwatch he's like

00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:11.040
my friend's up on the roof over there

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.720
that's overwatch like he's just using

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.320
[ __ ] like that well it's also funny this

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.000
is my tactical

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.520
well there if you're on the right you're

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.200
allowed kind of to bring ar-15s to

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.800
protest and nobody bats an eye if you're

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.919
on the left you're not supposed to have

00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:23.599
guns at your protest so yeah you go up

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:24.800
there's counter pro they're just dudes

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.480
as they are 15 so we're like this is how

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.079
we get down there's counter protesters

00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:29.520
now or whatever whoever's on the other

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.800
side of that who are like oh we hate

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.399
guns but like

00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:35.040
yeah yeah we hate guns but

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.240
they also were throwing molotov

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.560
cocktails at the kid true so i saw

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.240
footage of that i think

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.599
where he was like running from people

00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:43.520
that were trying to burn him alive yeah

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.200
so that's like a fair

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.639
that's where it starts to get into like

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:49.200
self-defense yeah and then but also i

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.839
think the total issue is

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:53.119
[ __ ]

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:55.119
everybody there yeah

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:56.560
well that's also that's how i feel well

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.920
there's civil unrest let me bring an

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.359
assault rifle and you guys want me to go

00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:00.800
down let's go inside

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.160
and then the kid's like well the cops

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.560
weren't going to do it so we have to and

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.000
then half the country's like that makes

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.160
perfect sense yeah and like

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.760
there's a part of me that feels that way

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.200
yeah that's what's i don't know well

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.440
it's also it's all gay dude it should be

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.440
no and i'm dumb so it's hard it should

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.960
be it should be that if it's your

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.640
building and people start to come into

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.160
it you can [ __ ] light them up that's

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.280
your property

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.200
i mean you might not want to you might

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.560

bunker down in a hardware

00:35:28.839 --> 00:35:31.200
store for no reason

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.720
it's like call your insurance company

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.240

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.720
i mean it is it's oh my gosh people been

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.400
whipped into a hysteria by the media

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.440
yeah i mean dude it's it's like

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.200
i'm reading or it's like a i've read an

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.200
excerpt in my book called presuasion and

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.960
like if you and they know the people who

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.119
run political stuff and campaigns know

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:56.000
this

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.440
so like the day

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.040
the two weeks before 9 11 if you ask

00:35:59.040 --> 00:35:59.920
people like what's some of the most

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.599
historical events ever happened you know

00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:03.280
in this country they'll say you know

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.240
whatever

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.720
30 of them will say 9 11. if you do that

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.200
like the day after 9 11 it's like 75

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.800
percent of people are like a 9 11's most

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.880
of it is the most yeah and then so then

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.320
if you're like running for a campaign

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.680
all you're trying to do is hit people

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.040
with that thing where you're like show

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.880
them their greatest fears all the time

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.359
what's funny is uh biden had to come out

00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:23.920
and be like i'm against riots

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.400
protests are good riots are bad yeah

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.560
because they wouldn't do that for so

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.960
long until they started

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.040
[ __ ] plummeting in the polls yeah

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.640
they just let they wouldn't condemn

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.240
riots mm-hmm

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.440
yeah so you have because they were

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.280
afraid they were afraid to be like well

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.440
that's racist yeah it's like no it's not

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.280
you psycho just say you don't [ __ ]

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.200
approve of looting

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.160
that's all you had to do and they

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.760
wouldn't do it until now they're gonna

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.920
lose and now it's too late i think

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.760
they're gonna lose i think so man they

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.599
waited until [ __ ] this week to be

00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:56.079
like riots are bad it's also like that

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:58.320
person joe biden whoever

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.359
you know once he gets a laugh that's

00:36:59.359 --> 00:37:00.720
gonna be on the patreon dude i'm getting

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.640
in o'connor's ass oh i can't wait we're

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.079
gonna get o'connor up here i'm gonna

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:06.160
swing on him for this this is all the

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.000
remnants of like feudal kings and [ __ ]

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.760
so like before joe biden would have been

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.520
like nah here's what i want to do and

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.720
then that would have been actually what

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.920
happens it's just a bunch of corporate

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.440
interests and then they just puppet real

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.720
people and they're like

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.480
look at the numbers okay you're against

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.839
looting now and he's like i tell you

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:21.440
what god darn yeah i'm against looting

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.720
and then they just try to play these

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.320
weird perception games none of it's

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.920
[ __ ] real

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.920
it's like the fact that like you know

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.119
trump now is like i'm going to build

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:31.359
more walls biden's like they're just

00:37:31.359 --> 00:37:33.119
rallying up like different factions of

00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:34.880
the population to vote and then they'll

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.480
just keep doing big business will keep

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.839
doing [ __ ] it's like that's just what it

00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:38.960
is

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.560
yeah exactly he's gonna thank he needs

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.079
to come out and be like i don't

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:43.359
particularly like him you'll smash

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:44.880
people's businesses and take their stuff

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.320
i just want to put that out there yeah i

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.720
need to say that on the record

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.800
you know what's funny i was also talking

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.520
uh i was fighting o'connor all day

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.960
and then before i left i was like why

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.960
come over and do the podcast

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.040
nicely just come up do the podcast

00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:03.920
but uh i had to show him that [ __ ]

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.079
buffalo springfield that [ __ ] did you

00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:08.000
see you talked about it from the video

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.680
yeah

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.359
that looked like nobody that was nobody

00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:13.760
that voted democrat watched the dnc yeah

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.640
or that is left watch the dnc nobody

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.560
that's right watch the rnc it's just

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.560
cause it's so embarrassing

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.160
all they do is watch the other side and

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.320
be like man that [ __ ] sucked yeah

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.839
neither of them watched their own

00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:27.760
because of how bad both were like i was

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.359
telling chris i was like

00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:31.520
he was like i only watched the rnc i was

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.839
like trust me you'd be shocked at how

00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:35.040
much

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.839
how similar like it's you wouldn't think

00:38:37.839 --> 00:38:40.800
that the dnc could somehow be worse than

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.040
the republican convention it is

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.359
i mean it's crazy it's a bunch of

00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:48.400
unlikable psychos trying to fake smile

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.320
and being they're [ __ ] it's like a

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.240
[ __ ] flame for narcissistic

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.480
psychopaths to go to that level or like

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.160
wait i get to be in charge of all of the

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.640
[ __ ] like surgical masks in wisconsin

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.320
be like i'll do that and it's like no

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.320
dude get out of here yeah it's dude it's

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.240
[ __ ] crazy i keep thinking what is it

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.079
going to be like when we get older

i i think it's you at one point there's

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.720
a leap of faith that has to be taken

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.079
that has more to do with your social

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:23.599
context than anything else it's like who

00:40:23.599 --> 00:40:25.200
am i friends with who do i want to be

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.240

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.040
you find the information that goes with

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.480
that you live a happy life and that's

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.319
that and then dude you find another

00:40:32.319 --> 00:40:33.760
online internet group that comes out in

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.400
yeah then it's fine everything will be

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.359

you might have failed the biggest

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.800
intelligence test yeah to sit there and

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.599

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.640

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.319
i gotta take this into my own hands

00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:14.319
cause nobody else will just watching

00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:16.000
rambo three and you're like [ __ ] it i

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.599
gotta do something i'm gonna shoot a guy

00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:21.800

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.880
[ __ ] dude yeah man it just keeps getting

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.400
gay

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.440
every day

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.200
but i mean the news would and that's the

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.400
other thing too with all this like

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.400
persuasion stuff

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.240
all they have to do is keep bringing up

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.319
bad horrible scary [ __ ] and like it's

00:41:36.319 --> 00:41:37.839
going to hit a fever pitch before the

00:41:37.839 --> 00:41:39.920
election because it's like if you can

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.760
get like you know they can prove that it

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.040
was like you know that was an act of

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.240
far-right aggression and then if the

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.079
far-right can be like a guy was just

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:48.560
outside with his ar-15 walking his dogs

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.400
and these guys threw molotov cocktails

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.160
at him and it's like it all depends on

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.079
how you're protecting it

00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:55.760
yeah he was taking a nice walk with

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.079
ar-15 and some clips on him and [ __ ]

00:41:58.079 --> 00:42:00.000
people these thugs attacked him yeah

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.200
then you get people being like he was

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.880
out there i mean he started [ __ ]

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.400
shooting people but it's like you know

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.400
did he walk out there and was just like

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.480
get come on guys stop protesting yeah

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.280
the thing is i think he's legally fine

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.960
before that doesn't who cares yeah

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.480
i feel like well legally he did nothing

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.040
wrong other than carry a firearm across

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.079
state lines or something i don't know

00:42:20.079 --> 00:42:21.200
what the [ __ ] it is it's also when

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.119
politicians do like my daughter was down

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:24.720
at the protest and she got shoved it's

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.240
like don't go and then you got yeah and

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.319
then you end up if you talk to somebody

00:42:28.319 --> 00:42:29.920
about it that feels strongly about it

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.599
one way or the other you end up arguing

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:34.160
against it yeah just rationally being

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.760
like

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.440
well he shouldn't have been there

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.640
and then if i'm arguing with someone

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.160
that's like [ __ ] murderer it's like

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.119
well

00:42:41.119 --> 00:42:42.000
yeah i think it might have been

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.240
self-defense

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.920
i don't know i mean this country has a

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.240
lack of clean masculine energy dude

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.440
there you need to be have clean

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.880
masculine energy just be like dude i

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.319
don't even watch that [ __ ] here's what i

00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:53.839
got going on and it's like you can

00:42:53.839 --> 00:42:55.920
completely ignore it it's just lost if

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.599
everyone watched lost and was like yeah

00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:59.760
dude we are on a desert island

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.640
it's like

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.400
just turn it the [ __ ] off you dude if

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.760
you turn that [ __ ] off if they told me

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.280
about covid and if i didn't know about

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.560
it

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.839
i'd be like yeah we're all inside for

00:43:07.839 --> 00:43:09.260
like two weeks you'd be like

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.190
[Laughter]

00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:16.960
dude i actually they shut down

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.560
philadelphia and i would walk my dogs at

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.920
night forgetting like the whole city was

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.760

martial law that was enacted but then

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:30.640
right now it's pretty sweet because if

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.079

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:33.520

up the the fists

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.760
no they go around

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.440
this i think it was in dc so people

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.440
would be like dining outside and then

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.200
like a group of protesters would come up

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.200
and be like put your [ __ ] fists up

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.520
for black power right now

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.319
that's why people like

00:44:00.319 --> 00:44:01.839
you're like getting screamed at with

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:03.599
pool horns like just what you're

00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:04.720
munching

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.480
launching little eggs benny

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.359
and a

00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:09.040
so bunch is life and then some people

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.760
get drunk enough to be like

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.280
you just stand their ground and be like

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.440
[ __ ] that dude you don't tell me what to

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.319

00:44:16.319 --> 00:44:18.319
even dude even if you're a liberal city

00:44:18.319 --> 00:44:19.520
slicker

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.040

people are getting patriotic after

00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:37.200
mimosas is so [ __ ] funny back to the

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.800
[ __ ] thing of being afraid of things

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.680
though

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.119
it's it's almost comical now to be

00:44:41.119 --> 00:44:44.000
afraid of muslims

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.680
we were afraid of muslims

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.839
don and now it's like i'm afraid of race

00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:49.839
riots dude

00:44:49.839 --> 00:44:51.520

join isis to bring this country together

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.079

right now isis is done yeah we're

00:45:03.839 --> 00:45:05.440

who are very clearly on video burning

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.440
[ __ ] and looting it so it's just like

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.640
you know

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.839
you watch one thing like they are

00:50:11.839 --> 00:50:13.520
burning stuff i have to stop this and

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.440
it's like i mean again if i owned a shop

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.119
and people were looting it i'd be very

00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:19.520
angry you'd be ticked i'd be very ticked

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.040
i'd be ticked and then a [ __ ]

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.640
guardian angel comes

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:26.359
in the form of cow

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.559
beautiful guardian angel comes like

00:50:28.559 --> 00:50:30.720
clear

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.240
thank you kyle

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.839
i mean it is thank you for your service

00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:35.040
if you look at this from the left's

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.720
perspective when they see like the young

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.720
black kids to get shot and they're like

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.400
he was a drug dealer

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.000
he was up to no good and like if that

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.760
guy of a young black kid walked out with

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.920
an ar-15 and got shot it would very

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.359
clearly be like

00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:49.280
you don't do that you can't walk out

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.400
with that

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.839
so yeah it means they dropped those

00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:53.359
police reports pretty hard on those guys

00:50:53.359 --> 00:50:55.680
that get shot by the cops man yeah oh

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.440
yeah they started digging i think that

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.280
dude in wisconsin might have been a bad

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.520
hombre who the the guy that this whole

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.200
thing was about in wisconsin well who's

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.880
the guy that got he was a pedophile good

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.440
shot he got shot

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.960
someone said he was a pedo he's a

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.000
pederist

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.960
the mayor

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.480
fact-checked that one

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.640
i think he had sex he entered no he

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.839
wasn't a peders he was a rapist

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:17.760
allegedly but like broke into like three

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.280
women's apartments and i think like he

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.359
broke into the hen house he got in the

00:51:21.359 --> 00:51:23.680
head house yeah i think well it's no

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.520
good it doesn't justify shooting him

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.040
because they didn't i don't think they

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.880
knew that about him before they shot him

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.319
i don't think so that has to be a good

00:51:30.319 --> 00:51:31.680
feeling if you're a cop that shoots an

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.720
arm on black dude then it's like rapist

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.680
oh [ __ ] he raped kids

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.520
still my job that's just cop's intuition

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.440
i had a good feeling about that shot i

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.720
had feeling yeah i read his plates

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.559
that's a [ __ ] pedo ass [ __ ] plate

00:51:46.559 --> 00:51:48.240
number no i think he i think yeah i

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.680
think he is like he was on like the

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.760
sexual offender list basically he had

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.200
bad paperwork

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:53.920
so

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:54.800
yeah

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.400
he would have got i mean one of my boys

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.520
probably would have hemmed him up dude

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.720
they saw him in the clink they probably

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.280
would have [ __ ]

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.240
put points on him dude

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.119
it said that uh according to wisconsin

00:52:15.119 --> 00:52:16.480
state law

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.400
uh he is not a pedophile

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.319
because he uh it was supposed to be it's

00:52:20.319 --> 00:52:22.240
like sex with a minor but it would have

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.760
been like sex with a minor somewhere

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:27.119
else but not in wisconsin ah okay

00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:29.440
thanks snopes did snopes include that

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.960
they're like not a pedophile by a

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.200
loophole look man

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.359
what did was he accused of sexual

00:52:35.359 --> 00:52:37.119
assault

00:52:37.119 --> 00:52:39.200
in the state of rhode island it's a i

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.319
think something it says something about

00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:41.839
happening in rhode island

00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:44.640
rhode island third degree sexual assault

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.880
that's bad paperwork bro

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.559
i don't give a [ __ ] what it says how old

00:52:48.559 --> 00:52:50.800
was the girl

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.319
i wouldn't say i'm not i mean you know

00:52:52.319 --> 00:52:54.880
maybe she was fibbing

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.319
i don't know but they were i read a

00:52:56.319 --> 00:52:57.680
thing saying that

00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.880
apparently

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.200
he was he had like a warrant people

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.240
claimed that he broke into their

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.839
apartment it's not it happened in

00:53:03.839 --> 00:53:06.160
wisconsin it's the same legislation as

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:10.000
it was as in rhode island so technically

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:10.880
yes

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.800
technically yes yes

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.040
sexual assaulter

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.319
so he's sexual assault or not a

00:53:16.319 --> 00:53:18.160
pedophile not a pedophile rapist not a

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.520
pedophile

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.440
what's snopes if snob say that too you

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.319
know

00:53:22.319 --> 00:53:24.559
sexual assault is a rape

00:53:24.559 --> 00:53:25.920
well apparently this one was like broke

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.520
into apartment and like

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.559
grab ass i don't know

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.319
blake was previously been accused of

00:53:34.319 --> 00:53:36.319
assaulting his ex-girlfriend with whom

00:53:36.319 --> 00:53:38.160
he has three children a criminal

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.599
complaint was filed against blake on

00:53:39.599 --> 00:53:41.599
july 6 charging with a felony third

00:53:41.599 --> 00:53:43.240
degree sexual assault

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.280
misdemeanor criminal is the other one

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.359
where he stuck his finger in her [ __ ]

00:53:47.359 --> 00:53:48.960
and was like you've been with other men

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.160
or something broke into her house and

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.440
did that

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.880
i got this whole that might have been

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.520
biden actually

00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:00.079
i think biden did that

00:54:01.119 --> 00:54:03.200
look you fall into this rabbit hole of

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.079
like

00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:05.920
you can't dude it's crazy because

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.000
completely it doesn't matter if the guy

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.640
was charged with murder before you shot

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.720
him yeah it doesn't matter what charges

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.559
are if you're shooting people but then

00:54:14.559 --> 00:54:15.839
it's like he was grabbing a [ __ ]

00:54:15.839 --> 00:54:17.280
knife and then the others it's like it's

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.400
illegal to have a night it's like not

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.920
when you're the cops are like put the

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.319
knife down

00:54:22.319 --> 00:54:23.760
not that when i when you're in a fight

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.280
with women and the cops show up and you

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.720
grab a knife yeah i think there's a

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.480
speed limit there's a cop you should

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.160
tase them that's i don't know who the

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.599
[ __ ] knows there's a human spell also

00:54:31.599 --> 00:54:32.960
it's bad it's still bad that's what i

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.800
know the problem with with knives is

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.480
people can close distance on you quicker

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.000
than you can pull out a gun so there's

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.359
like a thing where like if someone's

00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:41.359
like seven feet away from you by the

00:54:41.359 --> 00:54:42.799
time you pull out a gun or taser they

00:54:42.799 --> 00:54:45.119
can already have that thing in you so

00:54:45.119 --> 00:54:46.240
you know there's you can spin these

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.079
things a million different ways yeah so

00:54:48.079 --> 00:54:49.920
in this particular situation the cop did

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.680
have his gun out already though so yeah

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.960
they were all there was like three cops

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.000
when they're like three cops pointing

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:54.880
guns out

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.240
well dude well this is the other thing

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.920
too none of us were there so none of us

00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.520
have any [ __ ] idea what we're talking

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:00.319
about

00:55:00.319 --> 00:55:01.920
agreed but we did

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.520
see it

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.640
what the video yeah he's like reaching

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.799
in yeah and they're just like put it

00:55:08.799 --> 00:55:10.000
down

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.760
it's not good what were the five minutes

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.000
before that like i don't know but i can

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.760
tell from look i've watched enough

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.960
worldstar

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.160
that i could tell you pretty much the

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.760
first five minutes because it starts

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.960
basically in the middle of a world star

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.559
video yeah they're like against the car

00:55:24.559 --> 00:55:26.720
dog pile fight

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.400
everyone's a couple of brawns

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.040
ladies they're worldstar top three girls

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.839
versus dude we got a world

00:55:32.839 --> 00:55:35.440
story uh we have a horizontally filmed

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.720
video yeah we got actually a pretty

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.799
decent video going

00:55:38.799 --> 00:55:40.799
it's in a minute it's in uh 50 seconds

00:55:40.799 --> 00:55:42.960
so we still got time to pretend

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.960
absolute beating

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.119
but so there was a melee it was a world

00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:49.280
star cops was fighting three girls first

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:52.000
dude or two girls the dude was

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.440
maybe trying to break it up but i think

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.440
he might have been

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.760
i don't know i don't know where

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.440
why he would ever

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.680
get a knife at that moment was did he

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.559
actually have a knife people are

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:04.160
claiming he didn't have a knife [ __ ] i

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.319
don't even know that yeah

00:56:06.319 --> 00:56:07.359
so he had

00:56:07.359 --> 00:56:08.880
i mean this is this is the this all

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.640
sucks no this is the honest guy truth of

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:12.319
the matter because otherwise you just go

00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:14.319
like well actually blah blah blah and

00:56:14.319 --> 00:56:16.240
it's like okay so you know even if you

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.760
saw a clip like you didn't see the first

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:18.880
30 minutes you didn't see this you

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.079
didn't you didn't know the interactions

00:56:20.079 --> 00:56:21.599
or that maybe people had with them i

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:23.440
don't know but it's like you just see a

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.040
thing and you just choose to go with it

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.799
to appease your social network that's

00:56:26.799 --> 00:56:28.799
all that seems to be kind of the case in

00:56:28.799 --> 00:56:30.400
my opinion because there were there was

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.680
like their [ __ ] that comes out after all

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.799
these were like oh actually this

00:56:32.799 --> 00:56:34.640
happened the trayvon martin stuff there

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.000
was like a guy wrote a whole book about

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.440
that how that i think a lot of the you

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.440
know zimmerman sued

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.520
i did yeah apparently i think that guy

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.119
sucks and i i think he's a [ __ ]

00:56:43.119 --> 00:56:44.640
[ __ ] that guy turned out to be a

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.880
[ __ ] absolute tool total [ __ ] but

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.559
then it's like apparently the girl who

00:56:48.559 --> 00:56:50.400
testified wasn't actually his girlfriend

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.920
there was like some weird [ __ ]

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.839
it's weird wild [ __ ] so it is you know

00:56:53.839 --> 00:56:56.720
this is this is just

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:58.480
the thing is though when you see video

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.480
of a dude

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.680
getting shot

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.280
by the cops

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.799
that

00:57:04.799 --> 00:57:06.240
like they could

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.839
they got to be able to prevent that yeah

00:57:09.839 --> 00:57:11.200
yeah you would think

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.599
like there's like three of them

00:57:13.599 --> 00:57:15.520
there's one dude he didn't seem that big

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.280
yeah it seemed pretty small

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:20.000
you i think they could have tased him

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.079
yeah but that seems like the

00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:23.680
but who i don't [ __ ] that's a hard

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:25.440
armchair quarterback too i always say of

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.440
course that's crazy but then it's like

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.799
get a phone right now if you all got a

00:57:28.799 --> 00:57:29.920
phone call like there's a dude with a

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.920
knife outside let's go stop them and

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.520

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:36.000
like a hands or a taser you're like

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.920

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:39.359
starts screaming and [ __ ] you know i

00:57:39.359 --> 00:57:40.799
don't know you know i don't know

00:57:40.799 --> 00:57:41.520
but

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.200
i don't know man it's it's definitely

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.960
the people how quick they are to jump to

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.599
like dude like every single

00:57:47.599 --> 00:57:48.799
say like every single black person

00:57:48.799 --> 00:57:50.079
that's shot by the cops there's people

00:57:50.079 --> 00:57:51.599
in america who will be like all of those

00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:53.760
cases were [ __ ] they just yeah and

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.040
it's like dude

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.119
you've through reading a couple stories

00:57:57.119 --> 00:57:58.799
you've discerned and you're you know

00:57:58.799 --> 00:58:00.960
judge jury and executioner were like nah

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:02.160
that was all [ __ ] and then the other

we can use other people's slaves what's

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.079
that you you enforce the crime bill

01:04:28.079 --> 01:04:30.720

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.920
thank you joe biden

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.000

[ __ ] uh

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.480

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.280
they use can they use reenactors in both

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.960
these movies in gettysburg and in gods

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.400
and generals they use because you know

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.920
they didn't really have good cgi in the

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.920
90s so they just literally had

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.240
full reenactments of these battles but

01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.920
the only people that do reenactments are

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.400

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.239
drinking he stays mr cool yeah actually

01:16:12.239 --> 01:16:13.760
his mr cool was easily my favorite

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.120
version of my dad

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.120
just because him being drunk is my

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.800
favorite version which i guess is pretty

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.480
[ __ ] up now that i think about it just

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.840
having a good time him having a good

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.320
time is yeah because he's rarely he's

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.920
never mean mr cold yeah he's always cool

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.280
yeah it's kind of the curse of having

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.280
like a pleasantly drunk irish dad it's

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.040
like no he's actually pretty awesome

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.280
like yeah he's an alcoholic it's like

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.640
it kind of rules

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.640
if he quit drinking i'd actually be sad

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.320
like he was like if i had like a serious

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:43.040
dad yeah but you know

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.719

01:16:44.719 --> 01:16:47.040
life true to have a cool dad dude my

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.320

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.360

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.560
doing i like every morning i sit in a

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.320
chair and it's not even meditating i

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.159
just strip myself down to sim mode where

01:19:14.159 --> 01:19:15.679
i just sit in a chair and i'm like i'm

01:19:15.679 --> 01:19:17.520
just a dude sitting in a chair

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.960
and anything that's bugging me is just

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.880
some weird [ __ ] that i'm perpetuating in

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.960
my own life and i go upstairs and i'm

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.640
the same i must do what if it's when

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:28.000
you've done wrong like when you dose jay

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.360
well but again at the time i thought it

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.560
was funny

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:33.120
i mean dude it was one hit i mean it's i

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.719
don't know acid so you could have been

01:19:34.719 --> 01:19:36.960
like that's crazy and i'd be like oh

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.480
it's not a no it's not a welcoming thing

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.239
it's also like it's not a lot but it's

01:19:40.239 --> 01:19:42.159
also like if somebody slips he's never

01:19:42.159 --> 01:19:43.840
done it there's an inherent yeah it's

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.920
just scary because like i remember i

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.920
used to like handle like

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.679
decent amounts of acid and it's scary

01:19:49.679 --> 01:19:51.520
when you're holding like a [ __ ] a big

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:54.239
thing of it so it's like you know yeah

01:19:54.239 --> 01:19:55.679
i think jay was on the same page as me

01:19:55.679 --> 01:19:56.880
where it's just like is this what we're

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.840
doing now

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.159
yeah it's just a moment of like

01:20:00.159 --> 01:20:02.000
are we more

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.840
outrageous than comedy at this i don't

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.920
know it's junk it's junk that was crap

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:07.920
and junk it's one hit though but it was

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.800
very funny yeah it's funny junk dude

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.960
it's sometimes junk can be funny it must

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.400

back then we were afraid of muslims it

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:30.320

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.080
yeah dude but i learned the hard way

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.679
that was like people were not happy

01:21:37.679 --> 01:21:38.719

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.040
through this whole thought process of

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.000
like i don't think i would care yeah

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.520
ah

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.080

you had you have a hearty constitution

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:01.040

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.639
though what do you mean you can handle

01:22:02.639 --> 01:22:04.800
i'm saying you you can handle yourself

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.960
you have a very hardy constitution yeah

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.000
it's a good thing if a mental

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.840
constitution you the fact that someone

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.040
could be like i just hit you with lsd

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.080

01:22:49.679 --> 01:22:51.840
psychedelic dude so you don't you know i

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.280

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.560
dude i did

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.400
it what a [ __ ] treacherous act it

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.000
wasn't even the fact that it was it

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.199
wasn't the effect of the drug it was

01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:12.400
probably like what's going to happen

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.600
what's going to happen what's going to

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.600
happen what's going to happen yeah i

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.800
can't speak for him but i think he was

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.480
just bummed out that he because he was

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.080
kind he took a beating during this whole

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.320
election thing i heard he took turned

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.719
back auto constant

01:23:24.719 --> 01:23:26.400
every week just happened and then that's

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.480
what made it funnier too

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.840
like that's like because once you

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:32.320

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.120

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.760
time he [ __ ] up it's just like oh it's

01:23:56.159 --> 01:23:57.280
and then while he's giving his

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.199
concession speech already puts acid in

01:23:59.199 --> 01:24:01.760

involvement well i kept being like

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.840
like moving [ __ ] and then i knew it was

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.760
coming i knew it was coming i could have

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.000
in hindsight should have got it to louis

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.040
should have found a way to get it to

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.639
lowe's get it back very easily get it

01:24:16.639 --> 01:24:18.080
back to the origin it would have been so

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:20.480
easy to have given it to

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.159
one of the waiters one of the waitresses

01:24:22.159 --> 01:24:23.600

sitting next to be like bring that out

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.960
with the next round put it to the lowest

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.040

it he would chug that you know yeah

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.040

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:11.040
morning we all congregate we're eating

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.120
breakfast the only other guy who ate it

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.560
was just kind of like they were like one

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:15.600
guy's like i don't know man i think

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.040
there was like something else in there

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.639
and the one guy who was like high as

01:30:18.639 --> 01:30:20.080
[ __ ] who ate the most cake by the way

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.760
the one dude who didn't affect him made

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.040
easily three times the amount of

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.560
everyone else he was like i don't know

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.480
what you guys talking about i was fine

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:28.480
and just like didn't even affect dude

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.480
his eyes were bloodshot red

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.400
and he was just he was just kind of like

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.920
i think he just completely blocked the

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:34.719
experience

01:30:34.719 --> 01:30:36.719
like if you never got high

01:30:36.719 --> 01:30:38.320
and didn't know you were dosed he just

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:41.920
went to bed it was just like hmm

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.360
[ __ ] tired

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.920
it's like 4pm

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:49.040
he just like watched some wb programming

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.199
and then just hit the sack woke up be

01:30:51.199 --> 01:30:52.880
like i'm fine yeah oh you guys are

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.320
talking about so it's like

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:55.520
there's something the way your mind

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.719
works it's i think it's just kind of

01:30:56.719 --> 01:30:58.080
being able to be like

01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:59.600
no this isn't happening whereas other

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:00.800
people being like oh my god i'm

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.480
completely losing it bro so he just

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:04.800
somehow champed dude if i had ate the

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:06.320
amount he ate now i'd be high for like

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.400
two days

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:09.760
so it was definitely interesting i mean

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.360
again it was a horrible thing to do but

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.040
in terms of the you know you had a good

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.960
social experiment i was just watching

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.239
over it and trying to be like let's not

01:31:16.239 --> 01:31:17.840
tell anybody

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:18.960
don't tell your parents the stakes were

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:19.840
high i could have gotten a lot of

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.360
trouble we gotta get uh probably still

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.480
kids we gotta switch over to the page

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.520
yeah let's get out of here but yeah

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.880
again i don't want you to feel alone in

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.800
the fact of doing no i appreciate stuff

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.199
