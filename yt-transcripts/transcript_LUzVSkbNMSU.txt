00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.010
like really worried Jewish but first

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.930
time hurts on being like [ __ ] Jews

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.220
with all the lies I literally was in

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.350

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.420
didn't know they were still Jewish

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.700
people versions exactly still run into

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.070
some Persians exactly I heard I didn't

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.300
think it was just like anything it was

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.100
like a like a culture that still existed

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.990

clothing store back in like the 50s

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.260
really you know and like they want to

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.960

big J big J is a man now god yes add

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.140
hours of video content you're exposed

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.450
your belly showing you're a fetus in the

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.070
shadows dude I'm telling you the book

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.440
from jaron lanier about why to delete

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.090
your social media account it's like

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.260
we're all getting [ __ ] we're all

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.530
getting tweets we're all getting tweets

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.060
in like ways is making us kind of

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.190
[ __ ] [ __ ] yeah so dude I was

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:38.780
talking about this last one so the whole

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.020
point of Facebook is to basically make

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.540
you addicted to the platform and then

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.820
what they do is they sell so you're not

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.320
even like I'm grouped in with people

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.369
that look at the same type of [ __ ] I

00:39:49.369 --> 00:39:51.410
group or like that whatever so it's not

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:52.609
like on the individual level

00:39:52.609 --> 00:39:54.590
it's the metadata level and they are

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.510
like we have a type of person who tends

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:58.430
to be your consumer and if we show

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:00.320
certain content we historically can

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.330
prove they tend to buy more so what you

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:03.740
want us to pay us we'll do this for you

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:04.970
in coca-cola's like yes please

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:06.020
yeah and so we're all getting

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.760
manipulated into like basically being

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.530
Gary started and like everyone was doing

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:13.700
whatever they wanted with it

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.220
mm-hmm and then there were like it was

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.630
built into that from the beginning

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:20.300
that's exactly didn't pick up steam sure

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.800
what I mean like people were doing like

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.200
you could do weirder stuff mmm I mean

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.599
yeah it's like once it's whatever damn

00:40:26.599 --> 00:40:28.609
not so you could definitely weird [ __ ]

00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:31.030
on it like what doesn't whatever like

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:37.040

[Laughter]

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:49.440
[Laughter]

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:59.610

saying you guys are giving him ammo

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.170

yeah just makes me so happy you guys but

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.829
yeah that's what the whole books about

00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:05.180
how it's just setup to completely

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.400
manipulate our minds and it just keeps

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.690
spinning off in the leg it's just

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:09.980
getting worse and worse and how a

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.559
majority of people introducing news are

00:43:12.559 --> 00:43:15.730
fake their BOTS

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:29.980
I don't know what happened in terms of

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:30.340
it

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.900
they had Russian bots and that's why

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.740
Donald Trump won no they're not even

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.540
that the carmely news stories like it so

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.850
if you're like CNN you can write a thing

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.890
that's not really based in reality and

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:44.020
then have a bot you just go up and be

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:48.300
like oh my god the [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:58.550

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.380
a whole new he added on another hour

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.060
from soon hours the divide-and-conquer

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:29.200
on

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.330

01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:39.960
other Republicans are running its Kuma's

funding whoa so if there's like evidence

01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.520
that you don't allow free speech from

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.050

01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:02.200

01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:21.520
303 his first hour the electoral college

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.380
about five minutes and he would point to

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.360
the media be like everybody look back at

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.970
the cameras Colin [ __ ] gay home gay

01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:29.680
maybe I can you guys believe we're doing

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:31.450
this for the best do ya know it's for

01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:33.040
our was we're gonna do it again what's

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:37.210
crazy to me is that I mean there's

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:38.500
probably now we're probably going around

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.330
like bombing countries and like stealing

01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:42.100
people's natural resource as much as we

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:47.440
were really for sure so that's the

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.240
military's are scaling down China's

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.860
China's we're gonna have to [ __ ] be

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:55.240
beefing with China yeah we're gonna beef

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.890
with them over some territory I was you

01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:58.540
ever get in the Chinese ghost cities

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:02.620
yes yeah what I was thinking is like

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:09.430
that's part of their GDP but like tea

01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:10.360
daddy brought

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:12.580
reality TV to American politics now

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.710
there's a very of reality TV vibe to it

01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:16.120
the other day I was thinking I'm like

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.130
reality TV might be objective reality

01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:20.560
the point where like that's what that's

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.150
how people act like when you put a

01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:23.470
camera on them put some money on them

01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:24.730
it's not like oh look at those [ __ ]

01:13:24.730 --> 01:13:26.740
[ __ ] it's like if you film someone

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:27.730
you're like yeah there's like five

01:13:27.730 --> 01:13:28.900
million dollars at stake you would

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:29.830
become like it

01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:32.110
absolute scathing [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:34.390
maybe now that's why I was sent me

01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:36.430
imagine how you guys your group handled

01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:39.490
one DVD we talk about your family

01:13:39.490 --> 01:13:43.300

whole time you're on a reality TV show

01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:53.350
it's like you're trying to like push

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:55.030
your own brands it's like a contest to

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:57.040
like brand yourself and win like the

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.170

when they invented computers right

01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:54.360
everyone thought that when the stock

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:57.540

these stocks better they had made up

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:15.120
algorithms in the 1600s that were better

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.460
than the computers it took like 20 years

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:19.860
for computers to beat out just random

01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:23.400
