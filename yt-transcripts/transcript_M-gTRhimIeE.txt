i was in the bathroom urinating

as you guys might have heard and um

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.599
powerful streaming sometimes you pluck

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.280
your pubes while you're peeing yeah i

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.319
plugged it

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.080
in sometimes it's true every single time

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.159
i grab myself a nice little pinch of

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.400
pubes to see what was up i had a pube

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.680
that was

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.000
gray on the top but then

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.560
darker on the bottom which means new

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.000
growth

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.319
my pubes are coming out in color again

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.599
yeah yeah that my body just got

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.799
revitalized

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.560
my once gray pube i don't know my once

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.799
gray pube is now you know what i mean it

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.720
was a great growth that got the new

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.080
growth was

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.480
the chestnut beauty of my pu

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.920
they should be that feels like you're

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.599
being you're being refilled with new

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.920
souls i think so yeah something happened

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.519
where i don't know how that hair would

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.239
that is going gray just reversed yeah

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.760
that's crazy dude someone called a

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.879
miracle so i think it's a positive

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.720
opening i think it's a positive moment

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.159
for what we're about to experience now

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.319
what are you doing

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.439
lemaire

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.799
i couldn't even explain what i'm up to

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.599
right now it's classified

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.120
highly classified what i'm up to

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.200
personally in my personal time yeah i

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.480
couldn't even begin to talk about it

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.599
yeah okay

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.439
whatever it is [ __ ] keep doing it

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.720
cool that has solved every hair issue

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.090
but it's only with pubes

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.359
[Laughter]

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.799

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.199
david james david james david yeah yeah

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.280
thanks for having me guys this time i'm

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.050
pretty sure i'm going to stay conscious

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.639
[Laughter]

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.840
you absolutely that was the proving

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.040
ground stoner dads was the proving

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.800
ground that's the goal yeah you did

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.720
absolutely fantastic on it yeah for what

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.560
i remember i mean you took one for the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.479
team the second one

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.000
you did lose consciousness in the tomb

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.520
and that's all right

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.720
i've literally done that what do you

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.160
experience i've done that a thousand

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.479
times

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.800
i spent like 10 of my time in a weed

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.199
induced psychosis in life i think so i

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.320
think it's it's getting up to there

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.000
that's part of your personal time now

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.199
it's it's a discreet state of

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.440
consciousness that i do explore yes

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.039
yeah that's all it is it's just a

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.160
discreet state of consciousness maybe

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
that's when the pube comes back to life

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.919
i think so yeah when you get to that

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.680
higher plane and you're just getting in

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.360
touch with like magical powers and the

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.199
pubes like i'm turning back the color

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.479
it's like finally this guy's onto

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.479
something else yeah just finally this

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.919

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.320

this is a celebration of life dude

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.000

ex-girlfriends controlling the narrative

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.280

lack yeah for for sure no

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:03.440
i'm dude i'm trying to redefine male

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.959
male sexuality and just to being totally

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.839
control it's totally like seeing hot

00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:10.000
chicks and being like

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.480

don't show me that

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:17.920
just puzzled [ __ ] yeah

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.760
well you're raised to believe that like

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.279
you're supposed to be like turning

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:23.200
around with 180 and swiveling and

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.800
checking out hot chicks and being like

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.120
damn

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.480
that's the thing you get older and then

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.079
you keep it inside you keep the creep

00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:32.240
thoughts inside yeah true yeah block

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.760
them out unless you're on south street

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.399
then you just yell at anything yeah yeah

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.000
there's the point where you get to oh

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.200
and you see like a really hot girl you

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.680
just go

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.680
[Laughter]

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.160
i agree

00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:51.900
just kind of let out a little [ __ ]

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.279
[Music]

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:55.519
yeah it's interesting the turn your your

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:57.120
whole sexuality takes as you get older

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.160
especially if you're married it's like

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.240
you just hold in all of your life for us

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.240
for a long time what do you mean you can

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.440
either well if you're like if your

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.839
wife's pregnant you can't you're not

00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:08.079
like pussy's not on tap

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.320
to be fair no not in a bad way you're

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.399
both like we'll get around to this yeah

00:13:12.399 --> 00:13:13.920
yeah so you're left with like you just

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.200
you got a poorness you got to put the

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.480
[ __ ] under your bed for pushing

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.959
then you're left with this incredibly

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:31.839
charged sexual nature that you have to

00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:34.240
either like sublimate into like good

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.680
things or

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.440
you creep around motels

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.519
and become an absolute degenerate dude

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:40.880

just creep around or yeah or you're just

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.800
doing very weird stuff that'll

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.480
definitely make you feel bad when people

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.800
eventually find out you buy a hotel and

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.279
put video cameras in the vents

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:58.000

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.320
yeah

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.440
you don't know how long technology's

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.480
been around that's true yeah you're

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.920
right yeah your blow job machine might

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.680
be from 1985 you don't know you're just

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.440
holding it back true

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.639
i thought it is i don't know you know

00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:32.720
how they found that weird doors on mars

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.399
what if the weird one they found like a

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:36.320
weird space door on mars it's not a door

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.079
it's just like a rock formation that

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:39.759
looks like a door like it can go into a

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:41.120
cave or something

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.880
what if the egyptians went to mars

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.480
because i was like they have or i was

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.399
watching videos about the old ones

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:51.040
we're gonna remain slaves even though we

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.360
can go to mars

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.880
yes it's the first it's the perfect way

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.120
to vote

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.199
okay

00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:01.360
you think they put slaves on mars dude

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.279
why not they just sent them up there and

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:05.360
they all died because they can't breathe

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.640
well i don't know if there's cotton on

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.240
on mars i don't know if they could grow

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.559
properly no they were jews their slaves

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:12.480
were jews oh yeah those the world was

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.079
completely in flux

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.240
of jews that has to be some weird cosmic

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.919
constellation when jews are slaves every

00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:19.360
ten thousand years i think jews become

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.120
slaves

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.120
that's the rule i think that is like the

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.880
cosmic rule

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.640
jews were slaves

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.559
now they're kings yeah

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:30.480
they're kings

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.919

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.520
knows the trouble ahead getting those

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.799
anchors in the wall

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:30.080

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.720
hitting the [ __ ] starship like an

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.640
animal

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.159
yeah that's not i'm not financially

00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:29.600
affiliated with the starship but i did

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.799
see it was a triple vape cartridge

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:32.000
someone sent me i was like if you're an

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.600
absolute monster

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.039
and for some reason need three vape

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:36.400
cartridges

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.559
there you go dude this is captain picard

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:40.480
yes they should arrest you if they see

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.159
you with that in public

00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:43.840
the triple fave cartridge is walking

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.080
around what is that a smoke gun although

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.600
i feel like that's you ask me how you

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.200
get powers lemaire you just remotely

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.279
viewed slaves that existed on mars they

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:52.799
don't want us to know that procter

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:56.240
gamble doesn't want us knowing about

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.120
i don't think you should take that home

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.320
and then somehow like you're going to

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.080
put under your bed like an idiot somehow

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.360
and then like it's going to combine

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.840
forces

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.679
you can find forces with your blow job

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:09.600
machine and then then you feel like

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.559
lamera hasn't left the [ __ ] room

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:14.240

auto blow i'll be doomed dude

00:24:22.159 --> 00:24:23.520
it's been a long time coming but i've

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.840
been deeply investigating project

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.000
stargate or the stargate project it's

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.080
when the cia the military started trying

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.480
to investigate psychic powers and i've

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.240
been reading the first hand accounts i'm

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.480
so far i'm i'm almost done two of them

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.640
people who were like this was my story i

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.159
got sucked into this project and they

00:24:40.159 --> 00:24:42.000
were just like they had people

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.919
chilling in maryland just in rooms

00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:46.880
trying to remote view targets so like it

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.240
would be they would be in a separate

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.000
room we'd be sitting here it really

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.279
would be one of us usually one of us

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:53.279
alone for the most part and then they'd

00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:54.640
be in there and they would be like

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.840
they'd have a picture inside of a

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.760
vanilla envelope and they'd say

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.120
they'd show you the manila envelope and

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.799
be like this is the target yeah we need

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:02.320
you to describe it to us and then you'd

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.919
sit there and you'd spend like a half an

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:05.440
hour kind of getting into a meditative

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.279
state yeah and these dudes the two guys

00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:09.279
i'm reading so far claimed that they

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:10.799
were hitting like

00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:12.240
the one guy was saying like 70

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.640
percentile or 60 to 70 percent but also

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.000
like they would be like

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.840
where are hostages and they'd be like

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.360
they're here and they'd they'd locate

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.039
where people are this guy claims that he

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:22.000
has

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.600
live demonstrated

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.400
remote viewings for audiences and that

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.240
he there was like 60 missing people in

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.159
japan and he found like 50 claims i

00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:32.080
think he claimed to have found 50 of

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.120
them

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.600
and these they're claiming that they

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.279
came out like remote viewings too

00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:39.200
powerful we have to tell people about it

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.520
yeah and the military black the one book

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.200
the guy claimed the military completely

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.880
tried to kill him do you mean remote

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.120
viewing like they're doing drugs to no

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.799
they're not doing drugs

00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:50.320
they're just chilling

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.760
these are like military dudes that got

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.679
scooped up so like apparently

00:25:53.679 --> 00:25:55.520
they would get kind of sussed out yeah

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.720
for like people would be like this is

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.120
the profile of a psychic yeah and they

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.640
like they would like kind of find them

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.240
yeah and be like dude how they would

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.840
just like sit you in a room and go you

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.760
got some psychic powers don't you well

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.960
they would sit in the room and go we

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.480
might we could we need people for this

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.000
project and they'd hit you with the dos

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.760
and they'd be like and it would say like

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.960
that they're investigating psychic

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.080
capabilities and it's like they're

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.679
thinking it's a threat that like other

00:26:15.679 --> 00:26:17.200
countries are developing these programs

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.120
and they can kind of view sensitive

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.279
information so they put dudes in like a

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:23.760
[ __ ] ramada and in like russia and

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.279
they're like go look at the military

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:26.640
secrets and dudes will sit there and

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.480
start like sketching out like this is

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.679
where they're keeping this blah blah

00:26:29.679 --> 00:26:31.200
blah it's pretty [ __ ] up dude i think

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.000
i can do that dude you might be able to

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.360
but this is what i've been i'm trying to

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.960
get to the bottom of this right now how

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.320
legit it is because i think they shut it

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.159
down these guys like they never shut it

00:26:40.159 --> 00:26:41.840
down we're engaged there's psychic

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.200
warfare going on are you gonna try it i

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.880
actually did try this before it was our

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.880
it's an app called the rv tournament

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.400
yeah there's a remote viewing tournament

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.400
you can join into i didn't i didn't know

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.240
about the uh i think they call it like

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.520
the

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.039
takeoff or the lift time you're supposed

00:26:57.039 --> 00:26:58.880
to spend like a half an hour like

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.480
preparing yourself i only did it while i

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.640
was dumping dude i think we talked about

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.120
this app last year we did yeah and now

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.720
dude and weirdly enough i've been

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.720
getting i got a lot of messages about

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.159
like looking into the stargate project

00:27:10.159 --> 00:27:11.520
looking at the stargate whenever i get

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.919
something like four or five times ago

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:16.320
it's time you gotta look in yeah so i'm

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.520
going pretty deep into it right and

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.960
you've been practicing this power

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.039
unknowingly the whole time dude i did

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:22.640
practice it for a little bit and again i

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.480
wasn't preparing properly yeah and

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.279
apparently this was all led by the uh

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:30.080
it was the place leading the research is

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.159
sri stanford research institute so this

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:34.480
was research being done by stanford that

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.640
was apparently put into like a military

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.039
black ops yeah that now they're like it

00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:40.399
never worked nothing worked but there's

00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:41.760
guys who came out were like dude this

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.840
[ __ ] did work yeah and it was like a lot

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.360
of them would start losing their mind

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.320
yeah because they would we were

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.200
listening to me and know we're listening

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.960
on the way up they would be like

the first guy got crushed and he claimed

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:38.720
that like the military threatened him

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.480
into silence yeah because he claimed

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.320
that he saw

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.799
burning fields yeah and i think kuwait

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:46.880
poppy fields no no no these were oil

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.840
fields and he he was saying that uh they

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.600
got so much to burning girl desert now

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.000
in desert storm they were burning oil

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.840
fields to cover up the bio weapons they

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.000
were emitting and he's claiming that the

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.159
military he saw these fields and the

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:01.679
military like you guys can't talk to

00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:02.960
each other because they would have been

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.320
able to piece together what was really

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.760
going on according to the first guy i

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.880
read and i think the book was called

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.159
psychic warrior

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:09.919
he was saying that the

00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:11.679
united states government found out

00:31:11.679 --> 00:31:13.919
through psychic espionage that they were

00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:16.080
burning oil fields on purpose in kuwait

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.679
to cover up the bio weapons they were

00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:19.360
putting off and then

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.120
he was saying his theory was that like

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.480
the united states knew about this but

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.080
didn't want to pay out to the damage it

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.279
would have done to the soldiers so they

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:27.120
were like no one knows that a bio weapon

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.200
got unleashed was it true

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.320
i don't know i've never really looked it

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.840
i just read these books i don't really

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.600
look into it i'm more you know i'm

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.120
really reading it for

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.039
research for another a fiction book that

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:38.640
i'm like it's fun because then i get to

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.279
kind of i get to play with it

00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:42.480
but yeah dude it's been pretty

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.399
fascinating so far yeah pretty

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:45.519
fascinating i'm trying to get to the

00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:46.880
bottom of it

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.559
i don't want to look into the debunking

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:50.080
stuff too much just yet because i'm

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.200
pretty sure that'll take the fun out of

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.360
it pretty fast yeah

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:56.159

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.599
near-death experience and then when they

00:36:29.599 --> 00:36:30.880

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.240

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.280
just like traumatized since dude his

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.320
life joseph mcmonagle's life was the

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.839

middle no no he went to the military

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.440
because it was i think in the 60s and

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.040
joseph mcmonagle

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.200
physically couldn't get out of florida

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.880
he lacked the means to get out of

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.320
florida so he had to join the military

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.680
he was like the bus will take two days

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.440

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.720
saying you have to have something bad

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.720

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.079
manifest

00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:13.599

east needs to know what like 2 000 times

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.520
six thousand is it getting 35 nigerian

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.680
12 year olds 12 now

i don't know i'm wrong i'm wrong it's 12

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.400
000. what twelve thousand would you say

two thousand times six thousand

00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:43.040
how do you know the answer if you don't

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.280

either one what's the problem what's the

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.200
what's the absolute actual math problem

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.280

last thing you did in addition it's the

00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:14.640

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.200
[ __ ] problems

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.960

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.079
somehow

00:44:24.079 --> 00:44:26.640

the whole thing you can cut it off it

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.079

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.359
having urkel spill soda

01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:25.359
yeah well i think the the the dad and

01:02:25.359 --> 01:02:27.039
the mom the the actors who played them

01:02:27.039 --> 01:02:28.480
were getting upset because they thought

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.520
like

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.440
it instantly all became about urkel and

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.200
they didn't that wasn't the intention

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.799
yeah it was supposed to be their show

01:02:34.799 --> 01:02:36.480
the mom yeah yeah yeah yeah it just

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.720
became about that it all became like a

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.559
uh how far can you open your eyes and

01:02:40.559 --> 01:02:42.640
anger at article yeah like how's this or

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.079
like it's not enough

01:02:44.079 --> 01:02:46.079
carl was popping dude

01:02:46.079 --> 01:02:47.119
that's all i remember from that show

01:02:47.119 --> 01:02:48.720
carl's eyes going hard yeah michael

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.200
being like i better leave

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.359
oops so what happens at the end okay

01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:55.039
urkel gets cloned so they split wait we

01:02:55.039 --> 01:02:56.640
got to finish the step firing first yeah

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.480
somebody's purple and stuff yeah yeah oh

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:01.119
yeah yeah you're right

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:08.829
[Music]

01:03:12.559 --> 01:03:16.760
dude wait till i make a real girl

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.599
created stefan yeah it was his uh it was

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:25.119
just that's pretty deep transformation

01:03:25.119 --> 01:03:26.640
chamber it was cool him it was in him

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.799
the whole time so he transformed they

01:03:28.799 --> 01:03:31.359
separate uh stefan becomes a model in

01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:32.880
france and he takes laura with them him

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.359
and laura are in france all the time

01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:38.079
teleportations to go to france to meet

01:03:38.079 --> 01:03:39.039
laura

01:03:39.039 --> 01:03:40.720
here's my question real quick so they

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.640
became two separate beings yeah you're

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.160
saying yes yeah because before it was

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.160
just urkel transforming into stefan from

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.200
the machine but they never were two

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.319
separate beings did he make that out of

01:03:48.319 --> 01:03:50.000
his insecurity did he like want to be

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.920
cool yeah so he made that machine to be

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.039
cool and it started to the

01:03:53.039 --> 01:03:54.559
transformation it was like the show you

01:03:54.559 --> 01:03:55.760
couldn't stop those writers yeah that

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.520
was deep as [ __ ] it's

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.200
so they eventually became two separate

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.119
beings yeah okay why did he do that

01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:03.760
because he was like i'm enough

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.000
so he's like he had a free stuff on yeah

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.839
but stefan was inside of him

01:04:07.839 --> 01:04:09.440
yeah because they were both they're kind

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.680
of fighting for control within himself

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.839
yeah ah like two-faced yeah who said you

01:04:13.839 --> 01:04:15.280
go your way i'll go mine maybe that's

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.280
man win and then he took his lady

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.799
he took his lady on the trip into the

01:04:18.799 --> 01:04:21.359
france so stefan had laura from france

01:04:21.359 --> 01:04:23.119
yeah he asked her to marry her in france

01:04:23.119 --> 01:04:24.799
and she was like no and urkel was remote

01:04:24.799 --> 01:04:26.960
viewing that session i mean obviously it

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:29.119
was himself it was himself

01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:30.559
he's in the chamber

01:04:30.559 --> 01:04:32.720
jerks off if he's if he can psychically

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.280
watch stefan banglore that's some hard

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.520
cockpoint i don't if if they're two

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.920
separate bangs i think that means their

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.520
separate consciousness so urkel wouldn't

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.960
even remember do you think he was coming

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.079
when stefan would come and be like no

01:04:46.079 --> 01:04:48.559
[ __ ] yeah i'm more noble than this yeah

01:04:48.559 --> 01:04:51.119
it feels like a hand job no dude and

01:04:51.119 --> 01:04:53.039
then here's the episode laura and urkel

01:04:53.039 --> 01:04:55.680
fall in love so like uh he gets does he

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.760
teleports to france oh he teleports to

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.359
france to bring them back to block the

01:04:59.359 --> 01:05:02.000
[ __ ] yeah here again

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.400
yeah he brings her back from uh france

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.680
she doesn't tell him that they didn't

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.119
get engaged she's like it didn't work

01:05:07.119 --> 01:05:09.280
out and then uh why did f why did laura

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.119
reject stefan did it where his tensions

01:05:11.119 --> 01:05:12.799
not be here i think she's kind of

01:05:12.799 --> 01:05:14.960
secretly loved zerkel this whole time

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.839

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.480
insecurity of the real life dude who

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.640

he like

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.079
was viewed in his real life as being a

01:06:38.079 --> 01:06:39.520
nerd and like it followed him it was

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.880
something he had to like shake and like

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.079

it's typecast but also like

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.039
the way people viewed me in life was

01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:50.319

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.480
definitely a changed man though yeah he

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.400
marries laura and they get can we find

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.000

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.560
season eight finale i'm on it right now

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.239
you're telling me urkel gets lost in

01:09:56.239 --> 01:09:57.760
space

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.520
how did you you just let that slide as a

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.960
person like well i guess he's in space

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.480
now yeah

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.920
i don't know i didn't know what to do i

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.159
didn't know how to like look

01:10:06.159 --> 01:10:07.679
that was gonna question your family

01:10:07.679 --> 01:10:09.120
matters dedication is that you if you've

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.280
gone that far why don't you finish the

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.400
yeah

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.080
knowing you left merkel in space kind of

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.120
changes things for me no i like i just

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.880
i i think i read about i didn't like

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.880
want to i didn't want to get i was like

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.159
i'm deep enough right now you were deep

01:10:24.159 --> 01:10:25.840
deeper than anyone i know to the urkel

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.159
verse

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:29.280
[Music]

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.800
what happened pretty much everybody else

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.880
tapped out after season five everyone

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.000
tapped out once they were like done

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.560
eating a pizza they're like all right

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.960
uh so it ends with a nasal struggling to

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.199
recover its astronauts and save urkel's

01:10:41.199 --> 01:10:42.320
life

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.239
however it all ends when steve's return

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:46.239
to earth when steve returns to earth a

01:10:46.239 --> 01:10:48.239
national hero

01:10:48.239 --> 01:10:50.159
that's how it ends yeah so you're

01:10:50.159 --> 01:10:51.920
telling me the end of urkel was them not

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.360
finding er but they would still show

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.360
circle no he returns dirt so they

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.040
struggle finding him and then at the end

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.960
he returns to earth and he's a hero but

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.880
i can't find out if he marries laura or

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.840
not

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.679
it's surely implied that he marries

01:11:03.679 --> 01:11:05.199
laura there's no way they'd have him

01:11:05.199 --> 01:11:06.640
come back to earth and like i've been

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.480
i've been [ __ ] staphon

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.760
oh you were lost in outer space

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.199
yeah this says that the the viewers

01:11:19.199 --> 01:11:21.040
never got to see them tie the knot on

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.960
air what the writers here are [ __ ]

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.040
sexy all left up to the imagination i

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.560
guess

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.440
when they try to soprano's end

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.880
family matters

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.880
season eight

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.880
he left it open to interpretation

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.530
just flying in space

01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:38.080
[Laughter]

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:39.600
do you imagine dead or maybe he's

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:43.360
actually in space he's a hero

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.960
how did you get back don't worry about

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.640

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.440
parents are really terrible to him

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.880

season 10 but they never got that far

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.159

network issues with abc what yeah but it

only went eight seasons right yeah so

unleash it in season 10 but they never

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.320
