for me to invest in doing cocaine

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.879
see how that does

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.720
yeah that's a that's not i guess that's

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.400

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.400
grumpy sister yeah

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.919
he's such a [ __ ] grumpy isn't that

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:33.760
just when she doesn't have it though no

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.440
you get if you take if you're on opiates

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.959
my one friend said

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:38.800
viking specifically he would take vikes

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.440
and then just be like pissed

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.440
he'd be at work just like this he'd be

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.040
at work and just be like just be like

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.440
[ __ ] dude he'd be a [ __ ] he's like

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.959
sorry man these vikes make me [ __ ]

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:50.800
mean stop taking him

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.120
he couldn't god that sucks yeah yeah

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.320
because that's what happened once once

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.000
you get like fully addicted you're just

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.680
you're miserable yeah whatever you're

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.360
like taking it to not be sick and then

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.200
you're just mad the whole time let me

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.000
get my coffee so i can get grumpy yeah

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.200
you don't talk to me after i had my

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.600
caviar before or you have to constantly

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.320
interact with pill dealers too uh so

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.279
shitty

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.880
it's nothing worse than hanging out with

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.320
dudes who sell opiates they are the

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.760
biggest pieces of i'm saying this

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.519
including myself back in the day it's

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:19.920
just a jerk i was i used to sell

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.760
suboxone and oxycontin

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.200
so if when they people try to get off

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.560
oxycontin i'd be like oh here's some

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.240
boxes and i would sell those yeah you

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.720
probably killed a couple people

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.320
you probably wouldn't people would sell

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.720
you suboxones to try to get oxies so i'd

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.600
be like

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.120
dude they're they're pretty you're the

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.320
organization they're at your mercy it's

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.120
a buyer's hustle oh dude there's dudes

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.720
then dudes would take suboxones just to

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.240
get [ __ ] up if they if they like we're

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.279
off them for a while like i'll just take

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.959
a sub and get [ __ ] up

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.959
it's the craziest [ __ ] the dudes would

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:48.399
smuggle methadone out in their mouth and

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:51.360
spit it out and sell it yeah it's crazy

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.440
methadone's fun opiate thing is the most

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.040
[ __ ] up fun to see

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.640
methadone watching people crush

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.839
methadone yeah because you can take

00:09:57.839 --> 00:09:59.200
methadone

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.040
from methadone dude dude if you take

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.120
meth and a xanax methadone in a xanax

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.720
it's like being on heroin

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.839
they figured that out down to the

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:07.279
clinics and all of them really but if

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:08.560
you're yeah

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.399
boys i think you can switch to heroin at

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.360
that point

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.760
i think yeah you stopped going to well

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.200
that way you can i guess you're right

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.640
yeah you're getting off heroin but you

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.800
found the perfect combination

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.160
it's free though you get the free you

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.760
get the free methadone and you just

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.600
score xanax script

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.519
and you're the party's on dude the

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:27.360
party's back [ __ ] it's back to the

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.480
party dude

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.920
you're with all your boys at the clinic

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.920
dude

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.160
[Laughter]

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
that's nice i wish we got we should get

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.200
into that hills yeah we could probably

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.240
we could

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.640
get addicted to pills and then run the

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.560
podcast for like one or two more years

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.560
so good and just [ __ ] drive this

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.160
thing straight into the ground be so

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.600
good and then you'd have a whole you

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.360
know press tour about how we're back and

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.440
we're getting back you know god never

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.160
you can find god and never be that good

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.519
ever again nothing would be as good as

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:02.800
well but it wasn't supposed to be good

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.079
it's inspirational at that point

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:06.079
watching a podcast deteriorate the drugs

00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:09.519

we'll see we'll see i'll keep mine on

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:12.560
the numbers they start slipping it's

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.040
time to start calling people like you're

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.800

yeah watching somebody fall straight

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.400
down without a parachute would be pretty

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.640

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.840

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.799

commit suicide she's gone

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:18.720
be pretty easy to do again i have no

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.159
interest in murdering my spouse but that

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:21.120
would be

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.200
yeah i mean either you could like a

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.480
couple people

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.080
you could easily poison somebody like

yeah you [ __ ] killed them so that's

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.320
crazy

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.919
definitely you get away with that pretty

00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:31.600
good back in the day that used to be the

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.120
main move to make something oh yeah

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.200
imagine poisoning your husband dude

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.600
dude back in the day you probably that's

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.360
what ladies serial killers dude they're

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.960
always poison people no they never get

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.559
caught poison them and then take care of

00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:43.919
them

00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:46.399
they like make them sick for years

oh yeah that's nice

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:50.240
that's actually nice that's a good way

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.559
to die just get slowly poisoned by your

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:55.120
wife yeah but she's probably sent to you

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.559
she's probably so mean to you though

00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:57.760
she's probably like you never do

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.360
anything right you're sitting there like

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.120

arsenic in my [ __ ] food

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.039

00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:06.399
not figure that out

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:07.760

good they'll get that's when they do

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.400
that last little scan they scan you for

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.119
like yeah a tiny thing my body they took

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:15.839
him for that like well you know this guy

00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:17.359
specifically he kept getting stopped but

00:40:17.359 --> 00:40:18.640
this one time they got him on the

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.920
toothbrush and then he goes you know

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.880
they're like oh you got coconut

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.240
toothbrush and he goes i mean yeah that

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.880
makes sense i do coke

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.000
they've really ran this toothbrush

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.960
really

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.280
well they i don't know if i can't

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.240
remember how it happened but basically

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.280
they

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.119
i don't know if it's like the dog or the

00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:36.720
thing that senses it or something yeah

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.000
they do have that thing they can touch

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.359
you and like if you have any sort of

00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:41.359
like particulate yeah and then once they

00:40:41.359 --> 00:40:42.880
get that then they start going through

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.880
your stuff oh yeah and then they go

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.160
trying to find stuff they use this thing

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.040
or whatever but then afterwards they go

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.720
you know they don't they can't

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.560
like if you just have the [ __ ] and they

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.000
don't find anything that's yeah they

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.040

klitschkos are strapped i saw that this

01:02:11.599 --> 01:02:13.280
guy's hand-to-hand though because i like

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.720

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.280

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.559
yes

01:02:18.559 --> 01:02:19.760
they should just settle it like that

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.240
like champions that would be tight

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.599
just have both armies be like all right

01:02:23.599 --> 01:02:25.520

uh ukrainian yeah

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.880
yeah that's a good point klitschko would

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.720
probably actually klitschko is geezed up

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.760
no he wouldn't he's two keys

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.280
he might be too geezed up that'd be a

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.119
huge way to settle it though once and

01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:47.039
for all if you have two guys to agree

01:02:47.039 --> 01:02:48.559

01:02:48.559 --> 01:02:49.920

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.480
split the money yeah and the ukrainian

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.079

fighter like sliding him weapons yeah

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.599
