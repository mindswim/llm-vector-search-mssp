all of a sudden like between

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.660
contractions a heart rate heart rate

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.149
would dip so we were like what the [ __ ]

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.680
no one knew what was going on so like

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.910
let's see what's got what's happening

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.090
and then uh I've ran home to like let my

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.039
dogs out real quick because we were

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.570
chilling free had been there for like a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.540
day yeah so they're like I we're cool go

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.310
do your thing come back we you know we

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.500
have plenty of time and then like the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.820
lady came back I don't know what there

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.100
was some kind of the heart rate kept

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.900
just kind of dipping so she was a lady

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.340
calling me like hey this is a plan we

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.110
have we're gonna move forward with the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.710
c-section

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.020
turns out the umbilical cords around her

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.299
neck three times oh my god I had no idea

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.390
and if if Britney hadn't gone as early

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.829
as she did because Britney just woke up

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.930
one morning it was like she hit thought

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.490
like her water broke and it didn't so

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.409
she was just kind of like she's well I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.640
think she was anxious to get in there

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.350
yeah thank God she did because they were

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.460
like I don't know there's some weird

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.390
thing going on with their heart rate

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.799
that's why they kept us otherwise they

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.630
would have told us to go home so since

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.950
they kept us they were able to monitor

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.960
that whole time be like someone has her

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.030
her vitals were all like perfect the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.130
whole entire time so then since she was

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.840
there they were like something's weird

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.549
yeah and they're like we don't know what

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.320
it is because like she seems fine but

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.460
once they would do this stuff to like

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.670
trigger the the contractions the heart

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.110
rate would start to drop and they're

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.640
like - we don't know what the [ __ ] this

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.460
is weird so then eventually once so dude

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.409
so that that was just the drama leading

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.810
into it which is long enough very scary

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.910
dude you go into the [ __ ] c-section

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.690
room

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.310

good you don't know what's going on and

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.560
all of a sudden they just go here she

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.970
isn't dude you just see a human being

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.650
pop out on the other side of like the

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.659
partition I literally was like yeah like

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.759
I was startled and then I was like [ __ ]

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.440
and then you had to go over there I cut

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.699
the cord did all that stuff I saw the

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.560
video you cutting the cord which is it

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.210
was gross it was also that was tight

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.729
that was pretty cool dude you were like

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.720
watch your finger I don't cut your

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.639
finger yeah nobody's [ __ ] around at

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.229
all yeah the one lady actually was

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.430
[ __ ] her watch your finger then while

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.650
you're cutting but yeah that was in dude

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.210
I'm like describing that with words it

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.590
wasn't the most insane thing it was like

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.150
the most surreal [ __ ] in the world of

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.180
course it was weird and it's what it's

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.560
funny too because like whenever people

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.139
are like oh man yeah it's just the best

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:38.400
and it's like that's the only way you

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.009
can describe it because there's like it

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:42.930
has to be the best you can't be like man

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.889
that was a traumatic experience it's

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.900
[ __ ] crazy because I was going to

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.460
envision people who had kids and be like

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.560
what's up guys hey what's going on it's

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.550
like kind of shoot the [ __ ] with them

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.620
not realizing they just like all almost

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.860

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:08.819

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.470
definitely nuts but were there a lot of

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.830

but yeah man dude it that's d-day for

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.710
the base dude that's gross

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.840
I'm I you can't look at them the same

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.630
ever you just have to have that happen -

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.500
that sucks

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.660
oh yeah I mean yeah I mean that's a

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.100
that's the weirdest part of pending

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.260
torturous day that's just gonna happen

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.330
in your life and it's like supposed to

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.710
be the best thing that's that's the

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.200
weird part is this is the whole it's

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.150
kind of the whole kit and caboodle cuz

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.590
it's like you know you get a job so you

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.910
can eventually get a BAE you get a base

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.560
so you can you know obviously get [ __ ]

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.260
but it's like the idea is behind all of

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.840
that you have to have a kid Avenger if

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.040
you want one I mean the whole point of

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.520
life

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.040
ya have a kid and it's weird it's

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.960
weirdly satisfying where it's kind of

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.270
like it's why I don't know it's very

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.060
bizarre what do you mean try to you it's

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.520
like you eat people I was like

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.750
everything's gonna change I kept being

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.130
like yeah okay I mean I was like

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.050
obviously it will yeah and I was like I

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.330
just when you met I think rumpus time is

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.490
organized that might've just in the end

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.290
of the beginning of rumpus time that's

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.250
what I'm saying

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.740
now rumpus time has just begun now I can

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.390
fully rumpus now you can absolutely

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.850
rumpus into the darkest realms of the

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.920
universe exactly now you've accomplished

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.390
all your earthly goals that's what I'm

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.550
saying it's time - yes fully rumpus a

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.550
fifth dimension obviously the weirdest

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.250
party it's weird cuz it feels like I'll

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.720
be I felt like kind of grounded in what

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.100

would imagine is all these major like

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.519
they're not gonna try to keep trombones

00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:30.509
if it's between Trump or Bernie they're

00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:32.039
gonna probably try to keep Trump trouble

00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:33.570
play we'll see some like New York Times

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.779
articles and like all these like major

00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:38.669
media let's start to be like actually

00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:40.619
the economy is doing great under a truck

00:29:40.619 --> 00:29:43.289
like [ __ ] percent wood dude that's not

00:29:43.289 --> 00:29:44.700
even think about it's gonna be a weird

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.710
switch you'll say something like

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:48.659
pro-trump articles start to come out and

00:29:48.659 --> 00:29:51.299
be like what the [ __ ] yeah when BuzzFeed

00:29:51.299 --> 00:29:53.429
is like I know it's not ten reasons

00:29:53.429 --> 00:29:58.710
Trump is Bay it's good call yeah that's

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.980
a good call Ivanka Trump is a mood yeah

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.869
though like pick somebody in his cabinet

00:30:03.869 --> 00:30:05.429
to die Trump sucks but like these people

00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:07.499
he picked actually aren't bad I know I

00:30:07.499 --> 00:30:08.909
couldn't believe it either and I almost

00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:11.850
like throw up saying this yeah dude

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.739
that's a good point yeah the money could

00:30:13.739 --> 00:30:15.899
dictate well there yeah all that

00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:17.789
[ __ ] middle stuff hits the fan once

00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:19.799
it's Bernie versed Trump it's like yeah

00:30:19.799 --> 00:30:21.480
what are we doing guys socialists or

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:27.659
fascists yeah what we do we need to give

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:30.629
Trump more power yeah I think that's the

00:30:30.629 --> 00:30:33.029
movement either we go socialist full

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:34.889
Communist revolution start guillotining

00:30:34.889 --> 00:30:37.230
people or we give Trump the ultimate

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.059
power I mean can we just get a taste of

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:44.700
a trump dictatorship I'm gonna be bad it

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.980
would be bad but the Lord would be funny

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.639
for a little bit it would make sense no

00:30:49.639 --> 00:30:53.460
no you just if he was a dictator he

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.049
would just make all his [ __ ] rat he'd be

00:30:55.049 --> 00:30:57.599
like an African dictator there'd be like

00:30:57.599 --> 00:30:59.070
no rhyme or reason for what he's doing

00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.549
he just

00:30:59.549 --> 00:31:02.820
like 88 gold Cadillacs for no reason

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.019
well there's a reason for that but

00:31:04.019 --> 00:31:07.950
what's 88 a very significant number that

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.259
just popped in there you know you had 88

00:31:10.259 --> 00:31:14.610
gold Cadillacs 23 advises yeah that uh

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.639
his [ __ ] would be pretty [ __ ] nuts

00:31:17.639 --> 00:31:21.509
dude yeah that's like if we go communism

00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:24.119

00:31:24.119 --> 00:31:26.190

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:55.830
documentary on the rise of younger

00:32:55.830 --> 00:33:01.830
people taking like I read about the rise

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.450
of younger people taking like viagra

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.700
yeah it was it was pretty actually I

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.230
think I was watching it really bad for

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.970
it's got to be bad for you dude

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:11.669
so what happen what can happen is first

00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:13.169
of all are you familiar with camp sex

00:33:13.169 --> 00:33:16.690

so that's what a lot I watched like a

00:33:22.659 --> 00:33:28.690
little mini documentary the so I'm

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.159
researching like you know was like what

00:33:30.159 --> 00:33:32.190
those happen people take this [ __ ] so a

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:34.210
lot of it they were saying it's just

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:35.440
performance anxiety so like it doesn't

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.749
have like serious consequences but if

00:33:37.749 --> 00:33:39.219
you're taking it like psychologically

00:33:39.219 --> 00:33:41.619
yeah then it's like you're Edie now is

00:33:41.619 --> 00:33:43.450
just contingent upon having this pill

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:45.399
which it's super fun it's not even like

00:33:45.399 --> 00:33:46.869
placebo because it definitely gets your

00:33:46.869 --> 00:33:49.389
dick hardest [ __ ] but if you do it too

00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:52.179
much you can start if you have boners

00:33:52.179 --> 00:33:54.700
for too long the Mexicans are right you

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.309
only get a limited amount of boners so

00:33:57.309 --> 00:34:01.299
you're using skins are right yeah you

00:34:01.299 --> 00:34:03.729
got to have so like I think I think that

00:34:03.729 --> 00:34:05.409
science is when you take that you're

00:34:05.409 --> 00:34:07.330
using like 10 to 1 using 10 natural

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.149
boners I think well what can it doesn't

00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:11.649
always happen it does rule though

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:13.659
imagine the power of toners for sure I

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:13.869
do

00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:15.339

thing for your body I agree to be able

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.000
terrifying

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.290
though people do a bunch of blow and

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:39.520

it's just there's been like I've read so

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:51.720
many articles about just like somebody

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.040
wrote an article that was just like

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.970
being racist isn't funny and so first

00:47:56.970 --> 00:48:02.820
off when I read that I was like it kind

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.370
of is but it's like why would I don't

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:06.600
know why are people writing articles

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:11.040
that are like uh this is not funny

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.480
yeah like why don't you just let people

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.460
decide if something's funny it's a weird

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.410
man what's going on here that all these

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:19.140
comedy journalists are like sorry people

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.480
are done with this style it's like are

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.100
they cuz I'm in the club's every night

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.260
people are laughing yeah I'm not a [ __ ]

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:27.180
I would change things if if I was

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.770
bombing there's nobody more in tune with

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.720
what's funny exactly it's like I mean

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.670
comedian I'm reading some girl's article

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:36.300
that from Georgia about how I suck it's

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.740
like what do you [ __ ] know about calm

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.300
it also shows if you if you get into the

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.310
point where like you you're having major

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:45.140
publications right about you it starts

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.080
you start to be like oh this isn't real

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.640
on some level where like people can just

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:50.690
write whatever they [ __ ] they can

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:51.830
literally write whatever they want and

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:53.990
then I would feel bad saying their names

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:56.150
I don't name these journalists because I

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:58.700
don't want them to get wrath on Twitter

00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.960
yeah it's all journalists with like

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.430
they're it's like chicks with Veritas

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:03.440
tattoo do their own Institute and it's

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.570
like be like I think I got that the same

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:07.520
circle of people that are just around

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.190
like this special was amazing this best

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:13.850
I read an article this lady wrote an

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:15.530
article about Sam Reynolds special and

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:17.660
was like critical of it it was like well

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.210
the closing callback was pretty weak but

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:21.980
overall it's like dude and then they'll

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:24.440
watch and review somebody else's special

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.330
that's like a guitar act that's like I'm

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:28.580
sad and life's hard and they're like

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.080
what that was incredible this guy's

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.690
changing a genre meanwhile Sam rel is

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:34.700
giving like a [ __ ] sick special and

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.470
they're like well I think the last bit

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:39.320
was a little hacky it's like dude I'm

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.190
opening for Sam

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:42.410
unbelievable are you really and [ __ ]

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:44.810
Mia that was gonna be awesome dude Sam

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:46.970
Sam's of beat he's I heard he's a man he

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:49.040
is the man he's he's like a cool dude

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.200
and he's [ __ ] hilarious yeah I mean

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.610
also to that's gonna like spike the

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:54.290
suicide rate for comedians of just

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:56.210
having critical journalists being like

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:57.560
that was kind of Hankey it's like dude

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:58.520
first of all I just learned that word

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.530
like six days ago yeah shut the [ __ ] up

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:03.020
yeah I mean the dude the fact that this

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.880
lady wrote an article well also what's

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:07.400
funny is she was like well he's starting

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.770
to learn cuz he's not as transphobic as

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:11.540
he used to be like [ __ ] like that and

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:13.040
it's like she's been following him like

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:13.550
that

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.140
yeah she's reviewed like all of his

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.270
[ __ ] so these are just critics dude

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:18.740
they're not even journal critics they

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.150
call themselves comedy journalists and

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.100
then they literally are like I don't

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.540
know I don't want to [ __ ] talk about

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.070
this again but it's funny to read an

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:26.480
article that's like somebody's like this

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.780
is not funny yes [ __ ] well that's

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.430
that's like that's what you're allowed

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:34.160
to do that you're allowed to write an

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.750
article like the about music and be like

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.300
this music sucks yeah and it's like sure

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.660
okay but just yeah don't listen yeah

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:43.610
good try if somebody if there was like

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:45.590
if I had a problem with like dubstep I

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:47.180
wouldn't write an article and be like

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:50.860
deep band dubstep yeah

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:54.190
you mean NEVER dangerous music dude

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.280
outro if you're trying to avoid cam sex

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.680
yes too stoned and you submit yourself

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.540
to play the jams do you think they

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:05.700
listen to it the cam sex parties just

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:12.310
just know it's [ __ ] a it's just

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:16.080
prodigy it's just that song calm play

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.300
games just that yeah just British dudes

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:25.480
for sure oh yeah it was a fun rate then

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:26.950
I looked it up I think it was a college

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:28.960
student that article today oh it's just

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.740
as there used to be like critics were

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.480
supposed to be a kind of nuanced and be

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.850
able to like dig through the things and

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:38.140
be like you know this is cool then but

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:39.790
the no idea you would follow a critic

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:41.620
and they go my tastes are aligned with

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:42.910
this person so if they live and I'll

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:45.040
like it too but I feel like Dan's bad

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.670
it's like yeah ok good yeah most of them

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:49.930
are like if you're gonna be offensive at

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:52.540
least be funny it's like this San

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.140
Francisco it's like all these like major

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.580
[Music]

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.690
publications that are like this isn't

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:00.160
even funny my favorite one is this one

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.980

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.320

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.290

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:20.870
see all them being yeah we're better

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:25.940
the Year allowed to it's funny to see

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:28.820
people like I so the same way we make

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:30.080
fun of white people like I was watching

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:33.410
Trump try to speak Indian and he went to

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.330
he dude first off he went to the biggest

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:38.950
cricket Indians love Trump dude for sure

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:41.900
Arius because if this exact conversation

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:43.310
that we're having where you meet one

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:44.960
person of a race like well that's the

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.700
speaks for all of them I was sitting

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:47.990
there drinking with some Indian dude at

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:51.860
a bar on the way to New York from London

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.960
and he was just like asking me about

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.760
Trump and he was like I what do you

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.680
think about him and I was like uh you

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.150
know I gave him some [ __ ] non-answer

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:00.800
just to see what he said maybe he'd

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.150
[ __ ] loved him dude he's like he's a

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:04.160
businessman he's a good businessman

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.350
that's what you need good but I was like

00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:08.750
it needs a lot of good business for sure

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:13.580
but Trump gave his speech in India in a

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.010
packed stadium giant packed Stadium of

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:18.290
it he's trying to speak Indian or

00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:20.270
whatever the like he's like a quote

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:22.040
draught a or there's like more dialect

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.530
he's trying to speak their language and

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:25.250
it's hilarious

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:27.410
it's funny to hear people walk up

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:29.720
speaking another language that's so it

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.590
is for me

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:33.170
eebee douchey be really did every crowd

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:35.590
would react

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:38.800
[Music]

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.760
[Laughter]

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:43.460
praise these new but yet accents are

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:43.850
funny

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:47.360
yeah and seeing people try to not try

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.890
but like seeing people will assimilate

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:52.070
weird is funny like to do things that we

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:55.430
do like customs [ __ ] up is funny yeah

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:59.060
I don't there's no like racism behind it

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.560
it's just like it's funny he's wearing

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.090
his hat like that I was a food shopping

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:07.280
the other day and I saw a lady in like

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:10.190
full like much more call it like Muslim

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:12.620
garb but I guess the eyes and I was like

00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:14.180
damn that lady probably walks around all

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.580
day me like look at these [ __ ] idiots

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.850
not wearing the right [ __ ]

00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:21.320
maybe you know the meaning of like you

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.640
yours no way you wear that and you're

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.380
like wearing jeans it's kind of cool too

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:26.000
you're probably it is yeah which makes

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.750
sense though like if I moved to [ __ ]

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:30.950
Cameroon I'm still gonna be wearing

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:34.250
sweatpants PJs how can I instantly move

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:35.900
there and throw on a dashiki it'd be oh

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.850
that's weird maybe more than ever dude

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:39.440
yeah maybe more than ever you be wearing

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.660
[ __ ] you know tea sweats so like

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:44.420
don't assimilate you know until you run

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:46.160
out of those clothes I think I think the

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.720
rule is your kids assimilate you don't

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.760
yeah so you go there they go to school

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.140
and you just like sit at home and you're

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.300
like yeah they get bullied into

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.940
assimilating yeah first couple years you

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.320
dress them how you dress and then they

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.910
get made fun of and every day they come

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:00.680
back like do I have to wear this do I

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:03.110
have a final whatever well it's also to

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:05.330
like do so when you when you're born you

00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:07.100
literally whatever language you around

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.620
you you just like your neurological

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.480
structure forms around the language

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.250
you're around like the way people are

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:15.020
experiencing emotion around you your

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.760
brain literally shaped in that way so

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.140
like your brain shaped by the culture

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:20.660
around you so then like your brain has

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:24.250
been shaped by like whatever [ __ ]

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:26.690
Benghazi whatever goes on in Benghazi I

00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:28.130
don't know what besides Hillary letting

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:34.820
people die you're like Brett you've been

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:36.530
neuralyzed I'm just like a you're

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:38.120
neurologically your brains laid into

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.670
place then you come here you see chicks

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:41.990
with their [ __ ] butt cheeks hanging

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:43.790

bro look there's no they're not gonna be

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:48.620
like well I guess so it's like and fire

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.210
safe to say they're right about some

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:52.690
things including put the cheeks away

00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:54.860
that's a weird way that we're all living

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:58.040
something also - does that have to come

00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.510

00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:05.810
literal literal I say it's a literal

00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:08.390
literal cheek bones are showed and then

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:09.560
you see a chick's butt cheeks you're

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.100
