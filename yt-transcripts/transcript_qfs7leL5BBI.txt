battlefield now to uh just make anything

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.720
like just just to get the creative

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.159
process of like you know

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.360
vetting everyone uh just associated with

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.720
it to make sure they're gonna be okay

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.480
with every possible

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.920
like twitter complaint or whatever

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.840
there's that layer of it and then

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.720
there's uh

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.360
the corporate kind of like like being

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.720
woke is kind of like i think a tax

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.239
write-off for a lot of these shows

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.280
in some way because they're not popular

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.800
like they're not like good writers but

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.640
there's everything's

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.920
kind of failing due to that yeah and

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.480
then

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.400
i just got the news this is why i asked

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.239
az because uh do you watch the uh

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.519
mandalabra on

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.680
disney plus you watched some of the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.840
first one i didn't watch the new one

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.760
did you watch the one with uh where luke

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.280
skywalker came back

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.640
no biggest moment of the whole series um

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.400
who's the guy that was that was crying

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.319
about it and then they made fun of him

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.120
from oh was theory oh yeah this guy's

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.319
star wars theory was cr

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.760
now i assume he was crying because of

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.640
the terrible cgi of luke

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.159

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.560
cgi'd luke yeah

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.480
i don't know there must be a reason they

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.840
didn't do it well

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.680
because you can do it a lot i mean you

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.680

those porno people to help you with

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.680
the cgi but it was the thought that

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.000

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.720
and uh yeah just fired uh what's her

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.120

to catch shane up on how terrible

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.600
it was an awesome scene except for when

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.000
you see luke you're like did the whole

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.440

uh where are the women with penises

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:24.800

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.560
first off the bat well we just got a

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.240
bunch of crackers to start with so this

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:32.000
oh so you like a athletic uh college

perfect and i care about all of them so

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.320
like anyway i thought people would be

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.160
excited about this no

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.839
i just why did they put this up is it

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:51.760
like to because is this like a

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.640
jackoff thing or is this like i don't

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.760
think it's to

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.440
celebrate women but it's definitely just

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.760
for me to jack off right

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.279
yeah it's not celebrating women always

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:03.839
look

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:05.279
on the front row we've got we've got

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:07.680
somebody assuming the position

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.120
well yeah she's got to get aerodynamics

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.560
she has to race against somebody who is

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.560
biologically a man in a minute

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.399
who's going to just wreck her ass

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:20.959
that's fine that's fine i had dan soder

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:23.120

comedian joe derosa

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:29.279
is like embarking on a sandwich yeah

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.399
and we were coming up with an ad and we

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.640
had um there's that

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.720
trans outstanding trans athlete of the

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.880
year this video is hilarious

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.760
it's uh it's uh cc something is the

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.480
runner

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.920
and it's a voice over like yeah i'm

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.120
getting a lot of flack right now you

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.399
just see a race of her

00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:59.360
destroying

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.200
i mean it looks like in captain america

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.800
when he's lapping

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.240
the other guy you know because he's a

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.160
super soul it's like a super soldier

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.600
versus

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.680
yeah she runs past them and goes on your

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.880
life i mean

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.760
and there see my question is how good

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.079
when

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:16.959
cece was uh cecil or whatever how good

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:18.959
of a racer

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:21.600
you know without dead naming cece how

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.760
good of a racer was the male version

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.920
and fine that's what the friend said

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.040
like pretty decent

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.519
but became a champion at the transition

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:34.079
yeah these poor girls the one girl yeah

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:35.200
now there's one girl

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.720
in the picture what would i describe as

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.640
racing uh i don't know

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.600
great for a woman yeah i don't and by

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.640
the way i don't want to

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.920
fly i say season i do i say he's better

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.560
than women

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.399
i say that i say better than a woman

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:51.600
clearly based on that track

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.959
you could tell but anyway that was going

00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:54.800

of course well i don't know if you know

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.760
this as in the world of comedy

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.079
it's very uh trans friendly and trans

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:34.959
adjacent like

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:37.600
i know just so many comics that like are

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.160
either

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.200
into it or like like there was no and i

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.880
was in new york for like 20 years so

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.079
i say hey compete women you said you can

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:49.600
do it so do it yeah yeah i kind of have

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.320
a problem with

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.680
just women's sports um i mean

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.920
here's who wants to show that was an

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.880
athlete like

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.560
any female [ __ ] that was an athlete

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.920
there they don't like it they're like

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.560
come on

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.959
the people that set these rules are all

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:04.720
nerds who don't play sports

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.519
so that's why fallon fox they're like i

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:08.880
had a friend of mine say this to me with

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.480
a straight face from remember my old

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.639
show race wars would go to gay tommy

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:14.079
who's a good friend of mine he said with

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:15.040
a straight face like yeah well

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.040
scientifically they said there's not

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.399
really you don't think the people that

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:20.399
play the [ __ ] sport and

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:23.680
upload know better than some hipster

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.399
[ __ ] you know adam ruins everything

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:28.000
you don't think that's a possibility

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.680
and it's just because it's a they don't

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.600
like sports so they don't care if it

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.360
like who's watching uh it's a

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.880
coincidence

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.399
that they're coming into the sport and

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:39.040
smashing every record imaginable

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.279
would it be so bad for the wnba to be

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:43.040
interesting if that's all i'm saying

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.240
aren't you guys i don't know how many

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.200
females are going to mail how they doing

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.040
i'm just saying get over it get over it

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.399
shane okay

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.200
it's not only oh no now all of our all

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.079
of our uh

00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:57.440
we're gonna now all our buildings are

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.600
gonna be mostly bathrooms

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.480
to me that would work out for me yeah no

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.320
that's what the fear of trans is is like

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.880
not want like just building codes of

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.160
working out the bathroom

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.600
i swear to god working out the bathroom

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.440
sounds like i'm oversimplifying it

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.000
but that whole bathroom controversy of

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.040
like you know

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.880
it's i don't think it's so much women

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.480
are gonna be attacked by a crazy man

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.160
who's pretending to be trans which is

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.600
like i guess the ultimate

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.440
what i think is women are just going to

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.959
hold in their

00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:27.120
everything until they [ __ ] explode

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.560
because women won't like [ __ ] or

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.880
like yeah women in just a place where

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.320
women are

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.000
they won't take a [ __ ] or piss like

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.120
you're just gonna see a lot more bladder

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.079
infections of women

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:39.279
is my prediction so restaurants are just

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:40.639
gonna stink in pace

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:42.480
but but if you go to like places like

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.600
new york's a bunch of places where it's

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.240
all unicef

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.480
the reason you have six split gender

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.440
bathrooms

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.519
in the city is so people aren't [ __ ]

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:50.880
in there and so they're not doing coke

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.920
in there that's

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.040
that's why there's a bathroom attendant

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.079
to make sure you're not doing coke or

00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:55.920
[ __ ] in their bathroom

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.760
i really love you know what those guys

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.000
are doing yeah they're like

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.120
they're out there to give you a little

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.279
jesus i'm so dumb yeah that's why you

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.079
got to tip him

00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:07.760
never even considered it um well i have

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.279
a lot well i have because i've been

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:11.120
caught uh

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.560
in those stalls yeah what does the guy

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.680
just yell while he's sitting there he's

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.600
like hey what are you doing in there

okay because it wasn't like black rooms

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.560
in america are different like it's still

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.360
american when i went to uk it was very

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.639
like

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:42.959
it was weird i would bomb and then but

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:44.399
then girls would want to

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:46.320
[ __ ] after i s like it was like opposite

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.360
land you know you like

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.880
you like do well and you think you gotta

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.160
hook up like i would suck at it and then

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.959
unbelievably awesome thing about the uk

00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:57.440
uh

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.519
interracial [ __ ] they're like really

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:01.120
cool about like

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.480
it's not like any you know it's a very

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.320
like metropolitan

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.759
city like environment yeah yeah no no

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:12.079
i'm surprised england gets any kind of

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:13.360
like

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.040
you know you i saw i became aware of you

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.480
watching the doctor who uh

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.480
you smashing doctor who and when

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.920
on that series they were putting all

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.440
like this like woke racial thing i'm

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.399
like is the uk

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:27.759
have like a the racism i saw was

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:30.399
jamaicans being mean to somalis that was

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:32.800
the racism i saw while i was there

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.600
that's fun we're just not right in the

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.079
uk

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:37.360
like it's one of the most tolerant

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.279
places because yeah it's people mixed

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:41.040
there and i did get a very

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.880
impression that people were all british

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.720
like there wasn't

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.480
in america there's more of a separation

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.920
before you get to american

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.519
than there is in the uk it just seemed

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:51.040
like to me you know why i bet you

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.480
because they have [ __ ] healthcare

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.399
i'll bet you that's a big [ __ ] part

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:55.519
because they don't have like the hunger

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:57.920
games that we have here

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.959
it's the beast have our healthcare

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:01.120
decided by like a hunger games

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.720
yeah and that's why people are so

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.319
desperate to [ __ ]

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:07.520
you know ruin shane gillis for example

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.640
they got they made sure i didn't get

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.480
health care they did good the people

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:10.959
want to

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:14.240
ruin your they want to take away like

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.679
you you break your foot in america

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:17.679
though you gotta you go to hospital

00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:19.039
now you just got to hold it in you got

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.199
to walk it off

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:22.160
if you want to have a look you know you

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.839
want to have it fixed and like it's 10

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.199
grand

00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:27.360
and then you got your your ride off you

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.520
know so you've got insurance so that

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.280
pays for some of it even though

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.880
that's right if you have good energy

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.880
it's like 500 to a thousand dollars or

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.760
something

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.000
in the uk you know you break it you just

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.960
you go in a hospital

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.880
i broke my leg i go all right we're

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.320

here's some pills 12 pound please well i

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.480
don't know if you know for some reason

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.240
that's impossible to do here

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.320
i don't know why okay we've got we've

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.520
got a little bit better things to do

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.559
here like

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:55.360
you know more realistic goals as things

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:55.679
like

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:57.679
i don't know building a stable democracy

00:17:57.679 --> 00:17:59.360
in afghanistan

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.880
you know yeah while you guys sit back on

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.160
the [ __ ] sideline

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.600
we're outside and the sign lies with

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.200
your god damn

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.080
no i i i in healthcare we are so far

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.960
behind

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.880
uh america with um endorsing pakistani

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.320
gender studies right now

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.240
and uh are you really i'm pretty

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.600
embarrassed by it i would have think you

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.080
would be ahead in that particular

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.799
area because no anyone that wants to

00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:26.240
make a living

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.600
from pakistan's in the uk so

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.120
uh you know the people who are working

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.440
already there it's kind of india is like

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:33.760
that

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.840
in the states like like but i think uk

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.799
is more pakistani than you get indians

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:41.840
we got a big uh pakistani indian mix

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.440
yeah big mix but

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.919
i hear like separated them in the first

00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:46.960
place

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.200
uh oh we all live together they're

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.240
[ __ ] brits

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.799
oh it's the net wait pakistan and india

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:53.840
do you mean the countries how they

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.720
separate

yeah gandhi did that am i wrong no i

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.240
think that was

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.520
i think the british had something to do

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.760
with that one well yeah

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.120

what else to do the british i don't like

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.799
hearing that you guys are very tolerant

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:08.240
when you guys have

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.640

supremacist

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.960
yeah called hot air ballooning i assume

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.600

new countries we brought technology with

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:30.960

00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:44.400
um we've done that's what i want america

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:44.799
to do

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:46.799
is the is get to the british level of

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:48.480
hey you guys sort your [ __ ] out like

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.640

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.000
i admire about the uk is um

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.520
the parliament where they like have to

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.679
have a roast during their

00:20:31.679 --> 00:20:34.000
we don't have enough roasts every day

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.360
that's everyday parliament

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.799
yeah you guys roast our guys we have

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:38.960

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.320
yeah with like there's a certain

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.919
etiquette to it though you've got you've

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:52.400
got to

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.840
wait for somebody to say something

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.840
really [ __ ] dumb which in

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.679
uk parliament is pretty much every

00:20:57.679 --> 00:20:58.960
sentence

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.280
and and then you don't just shout you

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.440
actually have to make a very

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.720
uh specific noise which is right right

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.960
right right wait so that's not like uh

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.320
that's the actual thing after they go

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.320
however they have to make that yeah okay

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.520
it's almost a yeah

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.480
no i i swear to god because i heard the

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.000
noise you have to hold the paper do you

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
have to be like

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.760
right don't they have paper we got to do

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.200
it in the yeah you can wave your paper

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.760
if you want to be obnoxious

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.039
they're just they're just attention

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:33.120
seekers though because because

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.480
everything that goes on in

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.880
in parliament in the commons that's

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.520
that's the

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.120
the noisy stuff because when it goes

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.440
over to the lords these people are three

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.440
seconds away from dying

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.200
right and and and they've they who are

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.440
the lords i don't know i don't like

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.240
you guys have lords the commons is where

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.280
you discuss

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.240
is where you discuss policy right and

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:54.799
try and

00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:57.600
pass policy and then and then it goes to

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.000
the house

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.480
of lords okay uh who look at the

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.360
policies and go shut the [ __ ] up

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.159
and then and say no to everything right

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:06.640
and then

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.600
fall asleep in the stalls nice and quiet

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.000
right

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.360
that's why they're all roundy on the

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.919
other room trying to wake them up

00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:15.440
yeah they're just they're rowdy because

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.360
they're like i can't get [ __ ] done

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.559
i'm trying to think what the equivalent

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:20.799
here is to that like i guess it's like

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:22.559
congress to senate like congress is the

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:24.799
more low-rank version

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:28.080
of senate and um

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.640
yeah we also then there's a judicial

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.440
branch

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.760
uh the disney plus branch there was

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.120
nothing that's benzene

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.720
amazon who else who are the other

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.320
branches of our government

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.600
that's it amazon walmart maybe this new

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.039
paramount streaming channel

00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:46.880
paramount streamings they've got a seat

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.320
now we'll have yeah we'll have a serious

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.720
well listen i might just sound like a

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.240
bot head but i say this shit's all

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.080
connected because

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.440
all these shows that i watch as

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.840
complaining about you can see like a

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.080
micro it's like a microcosm of like

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.080
actual political [ __ ] but it's [ __ ]

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:04.799
amazing

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:06.320
and it all falls along the same line

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.200
which is these [ __ ] monopolies own

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.520
like all the ips and [ __ ] and it's very

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.720
top down

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.799
and very like marketing like you love

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:17.600
this like they market [ __ ] to you like

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.200
here's an example that makes fun of i

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.280
think hilariously on his channel

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.440
uh do have you seen the bat the

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.120
commercials for batwoman the new

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.760
batwoman on cw no i i haven't even heard

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.840
of it

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.600
they've got like a vignette there's some

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.440
vignette we can play

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.000
yeah in fact joey find like a little

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.200
vignette that could show shane because i

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.000
really want to show you

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.600
so john would you give you the tagline

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.159
for the next series of the flash

00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:43.440
yeah that's the tagline for the next

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.240
series love

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.880
conquers darkness

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.679
that sounds racist it does i think that

00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:54.400
was the british

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.039
empire's motto for a while it kind of

00:23:57.039 --> 00:24:00.080
made me think about colonization

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.320
brought back some good memories yeah

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.120
exactly

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.200
that's what you want from your superhero

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.559
you know running around

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:09.520
in his in his red pants you're just like

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.159
god you know what

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:11.840
i could really do i could really do with

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.840
love conquering i thought that would be

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.279
worse honestly i thought it was going to

00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:16.720
be more like

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.360
when this bat irish will you find like

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:19.840
like

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.640
okay batwoman season two trailer so okay

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.919
the first season

00:24:23.919 --> 00:24:26.720
they had uh this chick ruby rose who is

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.440
from um

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.600
john wick she's like one of the you know

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.480
and she's like

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.679
and there was a con and so

00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:36.000
batwoman is uh i guess supposed to be

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.559
gay in the comics

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:41.120
yeah and so ruby rose is only bisexual

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.480
so there was some initial

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.880
controversy because this is all you need

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.200
to know about season one is there was a

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.880
cracker in the outfit and there isn't

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.240
any more

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.600
yeah do you understand shane i

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.880
i didn't even know there was a [ __ ]

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.240
season one i thought this was a joke

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.039
they put down 20 episodes yeah i think

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:03.360
they're only making this so that as

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.360
can make videos or i think that's what

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.960
the what the uh

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.880
you know this has got to be a tax

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.400
write-off so yeah

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.840
yeah it's like tax right off tv right

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.039
by

00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:43.840
time to be powerful

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.760
alice is planning something big

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.760
and in the first episode she literally

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.240
punched a man's face up

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.240
yeah it was pretty hot i mean she was

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.000
she was pretty hot but i mean that suit

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.760
doesn't look like a bad woman

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.520
that mask looks like one of my one of my

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.760
my friends bellstreak said that she

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.559
looks like a

00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:13.200
58 a fight eight-year-old girl in a

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.559
costume

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:16.159
yeah well i think that's the idea right

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:18.000
it'd be funny it'd be funny if her like

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.279
super villain was just like an

00:26:19.279 --> 00:26:21.279
average strength to weak man that just

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:24.960
keeps beating her ass

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.559
she's like i gotta take this guy he's

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:29.039
just a regular guy that's like

00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:30.799
[ __ ] lady keeps attacking me she

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:34.080
keeps breaking into my house

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.960
oh that's such a good idea for a sketch

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.480
dude yeah

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.799
like a highly trained female superhero

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.159
just being beaten by a very

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:46.960
just one guy's like [ __ ] off me

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.520
this one you know gina collado was

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.600
believable as a beat a beat guys up

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.320
chick

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.000
sure she looks like somebody that could

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.600
fight you but that girl is a model that

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.720
girl is gorgeous

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.279
and you know a friend of mine is a comic

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:00.400
at this store

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.559
good comic and like but transition is

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:15.279
nothing like these [ __ ] maniacs

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:17.760
that are the extreme or people that are

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.200
just like there's something else wrong

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.159
with that it's not just

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:23.120
dysmorphia like hearing that athlete

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.000
talk you like

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.440

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.440
advantage and

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.559

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:31.600
uh

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.039

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.120
i had like a lot of like i had a lot of

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.559
religious stuff and they don't care

00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:08.000
about that in china and i had a lot i

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.799
had like

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:10.080
sex stuff and they don't really talk

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.159
about so what they like

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:15.120
is like impression like kind of like and

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.320
i mean like

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.080
like schlocky impressions they want they

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.799
want you to make like someone's accent

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:22.960
they're so opposite all the stuff you

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.919
hear

00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:25.919
in america is what they call abc's which

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:27.520
is american-born chinese that they look

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.200
at like shut up

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.039
they consider you like like weak ass

00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:32.320
americans

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.520
and uh it's [ __ ] fascinating like the

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.039
the the switcheroo in terms of uh

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:42.720
like their their police that that um

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.080
come to get you for saying the wrong

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.600
thing are probably better than what we

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.480
have here

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.520
which is freelance psychopaths who will

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.240
[ __ ] yeah

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.919
they have guys that'll just put you in a

00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:53.679
van for saying the government's not

00:29:53.679 --> 00:29:54.240
great

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.039
oh yeah yeah yeah um yeah and then but

00:29:57.039 --> 00:29:58.240
the good thing is though right because

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:58.960
where are you

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.919
going to say that not true i know you

00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:02.880
want to say that though

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.880
because because you say that they come

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.080
in the van

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.480
they take you away for re-education

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.559
uh but when they open up the van you get

00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:13.919
a great view

00:30:13.919 --> 00:30:15.840
of [ __ ] disney filming the next star

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.120
wars movie

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.600
yeah in fact you might you might start

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.159
like

00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:22.159
you know it's just background body it's

00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:23.279
the new avengers

00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:26.480
movie oh maybe harvested for organs yeah

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.120
it's gas

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.360
time oh come on could give me five

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.399
minutes come on guys

00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:34.159
we're trying to finish by five um and i

00:30:34.159 --> 00:30:36.320
well the point is they have captain

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.640
america is coming out

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.360
would you say coming out captain america

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.720
is coming he's just about to film his

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.440
scene

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.320
did captain america quick question that

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.159
did that go over in the chinese market

00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:50.000
captain america is captain america

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.039
popular in other because it i was just

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:54.000
thinking about that like

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.039
just from some other country and the

00:30:55.039 --> 00:30:56.640
superheroes called captain america that

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.000
would seem bizarre

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.720
i think the avengers did well in china

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.640
avengers but i mean captain america

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.279
himself

00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:06.159
is there a thing where they're like like

00:31:06.159 --> 00:31:08.080
would how well would captain china do

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.440
here if they release the captain china's

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.480
what i'm saying like

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.960
it seems like a strange i think you seem

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.000
very very well important

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.519
i mean honestly i would watch it if

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:18.559
there's something called captain china

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:20.399
i'm gonna watch that that sounds

00:31:20.399 --> 00:31:22.880
[ __ ] amazing because there might be

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.480
just be some guy walking around

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.039
america uh just saying horrible things

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:28.320
to black people

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.320
wait what'd you say that's what that's

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.960
what captain china would be

prostitution or no

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.159

walkers to do their business

00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:10.000
but they were not allowing hairdressers

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.840

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.440
do you just have to do that

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.720
why not i like it yeah i support it i

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.599
support steroids in sports as well

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:19.760
well in sports it's like especially in

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.040
fighting

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.920
i mean well now i would i would

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.520
definitely endorse steroids

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.599
if i came up against that monster in

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:29.040
their first class i think

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.440
i think um the girl racers should be

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.800
allowed to use steroids

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.240
actually yeah that is that is a bit

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.480
um callous of me and i take that back

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.280
i think the other women should get

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.079
motorcycles

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.079
yeah listen it looked like a superhero

00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:51.680
i was largely a superhero that's what it

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.119
looked like it was that not bad woman

00:36:55.119 --> 00:36:58.720
i mean for real shane thank you i i

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.359
like that's the first question when i

00:37:01.359 --> 00:37:03.119
look at the lovely

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:04.640
bad woman who i don't really believe she

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.839
better eat some puzzles i don't believe

00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:06.240
she's

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.119
really lesbian enough to play bad woman

00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:11.599
i think i think gabriel leslie

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:14.640
identifies as bisexual as well just like

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.839
that woman by the way

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:23.040
bisexual shut up yeah

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:26.160
i need work we talk about not getting

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.920
the respect of gays or straights

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.960
try being a bicycle yeah

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.560
especially when guys do it they're like

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.079

00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:36.480

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.240

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.119
bisexuals

00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:50.960

her getting wailed on by a dude and then

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.040

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.800

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.640
riding motorcycles and doing cool stuff

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.280
and then just

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.119
one second is there there's a pretty

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:42.560
hockey punched in the stomach

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.760

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.160
before i start laughing at this because

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.000
i couldn't first of all i already

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.480
didn't believe liam neeson okay yeah

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.480
as jim norton said with soy sauce in his

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.839
hair

00:41:59.839 --> 00:42:02.000
just died 50 old man those skills

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.119
degrade over time

00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:05.119
so yeah i don't believe it as a man do

00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:07.520
it like i certainly don't believe

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.400
but if they said okay she's ex-cia i

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.240
don't know if you know that the cia

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.160
is the world's foremost karate school

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.240
also apparently yeah

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.079
you do realize that you also clean

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:19.599
floors at the cia

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:21.359
depending on what well okay wait wait

00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:22.800
wait wait you know

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.839
you're saying she was a janitor yeah i'm

00:42:25.839 --> 00:42:27.440
i'm trying to say that just because

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.119
you're in the cia doesn't make you a

00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:30.160
field operative

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.400
that is skilled in there i know look

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.599

00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:37.040
thank you for correcting that shane

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.599

00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:40.640
to make this

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.119
what this is

00:42:45.119 --> 00:42:47.920
okay listen that could be if if it's

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.079
like oh this is a 50 year old woman

00:42:50.079 --> 00:42:51.599
okay yeah there's people in ci that

00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:53.760
aren't karate people

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.119

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:57.599
to do [ __ ] that's just like thinky stuff

00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:59.440

him being karate champ

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.040
like she's just really small that could

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:05.839
be the character

00:43:05.839 --> 00:43:09.280
she uses her wits as an ex-spy

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.720
not to fight because she can't do that

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.640

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.520
the company must be pretty desperate if

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.119
they sent your skinny ass up here

00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:10.720
well they figured you'd kill anybody

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.160
else

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.920
they want you back robin you're the best

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.920
thing do you think it's like the movie

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.680
used to [ __ ] like uh she's five foot ten

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.839
really really fight

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.119
this world is just looking for a reason

00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:33.200
to put a young black girl on that side

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.079
of the fence

00:44:34.079 --> 00:44:37.520
don't help them superman did you work

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:38.319
for the cia

00:44:38.319 --> 00:44:41.040
probably murdering uh sleep it's not

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.720
because all the brown people around the

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.960
world it's because of all the people

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.680
that i couldn't say

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.800
as a scene i really think she could help

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.839
if anyone can

00:44:51.839 --> 00:44:55.440
i'm super bad it's mccall

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.880
how many people are out there desperate

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.440
with no way to turn

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:05.839
they have some way to turn

00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:19.839
one

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.599
i didn't see enough uh the handy i want

00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:25.040
to see the hand-to-hand combat that's

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.400
the thing that i was um

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.440
wow she did beat up like six armed men

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.079
in the first

00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:31.920
scene there do you suffer from i wanted

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.520
to see the real choreography

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.800
you know let it breathe literally oh

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.200
it'd be great to see the how slow it was

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.400
when they filmed it for real

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.240
do you remember chuck norris in walker

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.920
texas ranger and they would always slow

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.839
motion his

00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:45.839
it's like he would always kick ass like

00:45:45.839 --> 00:45:47.200
and then at a certain point i was like i

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.640
don't i think this is actually how fast

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.839
chuck norris moves it's not

00:45:52.079 --> 00:45:55.359
it's not being slowed down yeah they

00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:57.359
did about 30 jump cuts for the fight

00:45:57.359 --> 00:45:58.640
scene

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.119
did you watch uh as the bird of prey

00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:02.720
movie where they had i imagine a bunch

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.520
of girls that

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.960
it's like these model kind of girls

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.760
beating up gangs of uh

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.720
yeah i went to the uh i went to the um

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.880
on opening day

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.440
and uh the cinema was packed there was

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.160
eight of us

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.040
uh and i felt i felt a little bit out of

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:21.760
place because

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.200
there was eight of us there was there

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.440
was uh three couples

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.920
and uh guy and girl and then there was

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.280
me mate

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:32.240
uh so we kind of looked like uh the gay

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.000
the token gay couple who had come to

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:34.560
watch the

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.640
the women in the nice frilly outfits

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.599
yeah okay

00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:40.640
um but uh yeah it was uh it was it was

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.000
dark [ __ ]

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.720
he was really dog [ __ ] yeah well most

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.160
comic books are

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.480
right aren't they all bad but when the

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.680
first one came out

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.359
which wasn't a good movie suicide's glad

00:46:51.359 --> 00:46:53.040
she was good in that in the

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.960
suicide squad yeah she was the more

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.240
interesting thing

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.800
that was what i saw the concern she was

00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.680
she was uh

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.440
she she worked well off the other

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.800
characters because she wasn't

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.960
the main character she was a secondary

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.560
character and that's what harley quinn

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.119
is or

00:47:07.119 --> 00:47:10.560
if they acknowledge that she's a like

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.400
well i didn't like i watched it but what

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.720
was clear from it is you're supposed to

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.160
like this is a hero the thing that's

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.319
disturbing you can say hey she's a

00:47:18.319 --> 00:47:19.839
[ __ ] psychopath piece of [ __ ] and

00:47:19.839 --> 00:47:21.440
that could be very interesting

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.440
you know there's a movie called uh

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.960
ingrid goes west

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.400
but then her character would just be

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.160
woman

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:31.839
uh it's just

00:47:31.839 --> 00:47:35.040
women on period now just

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.920
woman after two years of relationship oh

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:38.880
[ __ ] she's here

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.960
[ __ ] get out of here guys how'd she find

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.119
out about this

00:47:43.119 --> 00:47:47.359
she's in party's over um

00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:50.640
i lost my train of thought

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.720
i don't like superhero [ __ ] oh okay so

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.960
yeah she was the morning oh sorry

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.000
everyone

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.440
no the thing is they try to make these

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.280
piece of [ __ ] people like like they

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.079
don't understand

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:04.160
how you make characters interesting you

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.280
know like

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.800
years of like writing for stuff what i

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.400
would notice is like like go like

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.920
ghostbusters for example the classic

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.440
ghostbusters

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.880
they're not like good guy they're kind

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.359
of kind of pieces of [ __ ] and con men

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:16.960
they're not good guys being held held

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.520
down by the patriarchy

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.160
they're like so like a female

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:22.960
ghostbuster dude

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.839
i'm telling you i could have wrote that

00:48:23.839 --> 00:48:25.280
and made that funny i know exactly how i

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.640
make the characters i have one woman

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.960
who's like a phony spirit medium

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.280
fake like new agey person like a con

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.000
artist

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.800
you know you like but they can't do that

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.760
they got to have a

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.520
thing where it's like you're good as you

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.200
are born there's nothing wrong with you

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.640
there's no journey

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.079
it's like the inverse of a hero's

00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:44.240
journey who said somebody says that

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.440
doesn't he like doesn't gary say

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:46.800
something like that

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.599
somebody yeah yeah but it is though you

00:48:49.599 --> 00:48:51.359
start off at the top and then you go now

00:48:51.359 --> 00:48:52.880
you just realize you're even better than

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.880
you thought you were in the beginning

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.880
yeah that's how the well you started for

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.400
the top and then

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.720
everybody tells you how great you are

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.240
but you don't believe it yourself

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.640
and then you just yeah you are just like

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:10.800
the best that was essentially um

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.079
star trek discovery i didn't want

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:15.520
do were you ever a guy who watched star

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.440
trek uh uh shane

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.480
i wasn't i liked star wars as a kid so

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.119
you're more

00:49:21.119 --> 00:49:22.880
like the people who make the star trek

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.400
now they're like that they're more star

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.119
wars

00:49:25.119 --> 00:49:26.800
they're more your shane gillis star wars

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.960
guys they probably shouldn't do star

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.720
trek i like the ewoks

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.040
well yeah i like them i'm fine with

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:33.760
ewoks

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.319
i wasn't against them i was pro ewok as

00:49:36.319 --> 00:49:37.119
a kid

00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:38.800
i'll come out and say oh return of the

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.400
jedi was my favorite movie as a young

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.040
boy

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.440
am i wrong as you're you're a nerd you

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.400
okay

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.240
last jedi the controversial scene i

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.000
wanted to bring this up before

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.520
you know the the mary poppins thing

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.359
everybody says like how how could they

00:49:51.359 --> 00:49:52.160
do that

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.000
okay in space where you weigh nothing

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.680
isn't that be easier than getting a

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.359
lightsaber to your hand

00:49:59.359 --> 00:50:00.880
like that's probably where you can marry

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.559
poppins as a jedi

00:50:02.559 --> 00:50:04.079
because you're just picking you don't

00:50:04.079 --> 00:50:05.680
waste [ __ ] in space you know so it's

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.280
probably the easiest thing in the world

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.680
for a jedi to fly around in space yeah

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.480
but

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.680
she was blown out of the ship and um she

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.000
was

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.200
unconscious power of love saved her ah

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.520
[ __ ] it's called the force yeah it

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.280
conquers darkness

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.000
yeah well that makes yeah they [ __ ]

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.920
those stars up dude i was so excited for

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.480
those

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.599
and then you know and then you got to

00:50:27.599 --> 00:50:30.240
remember it is a kids movie

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.440
um yeah but that's like the excuse to

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.280
make garbage is to go yeah you can give

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.880
kids crap

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.440
like when i saw the original ones it was

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.680
a thing that your dad took you to

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.319
yeah my sister went too but your dad

00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:45.200
takes you to it

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.839
because he likes it too yeah because

00:50:47.839 --> 00:50:49.599
it's a thing that's like pretty good

00:50:49.599 --> 00:50:52.720
it's generational it's a thing like

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.280
and so now they're like that's directly

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.280
it's like the new coke formula

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.559
and the thing is gross is like people

00:50:58.559 --> 00:50:59.680
get all political but it's not even

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.480
political it's

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.680
it's the most craven like trend chasing

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.319
from

00:51:04.319 --> 00:51:05.440
there's only one kind of person that

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.040
gets to a certain level now in these

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.000
gumbies that are all from

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.680
the same they all went to the same like

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.520
colleges and

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.280
there's not if you'll notice it's a

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.720
direct thing to keep like

okay do you want to see what gina carano

00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:43.200
got fired for first but

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.880
this tweet real quick shane yeah i'd

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.960
like to see that

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:49.599
okay jews were beaten in the streets not

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:51.599
by nazi soldiers but by their neighbors

00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:52.720
even by children

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.280
sad emoticon because history is edited

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.640
most people today don't realize that to

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.079
get to the point where nazi soldiers

00:52:58.079 --> 00:52:59.599
could easily round up thousands of jews

00:52:59.599 --> 00:53:00.480
the government

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.400
first made their own neighbors hate them

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.760
simply for being jews

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.359
how is that any different from hating

00:53:05.359 --> 00:53:07.280
someone for their political views

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:11.119
and that despicable message

00:53:11.119 --> 00:53:15.599
is why she was fired what

00:53:15.599 --> 00:53:17.760
yeah oh okay but this is i guess this is

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.800
why they really

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.319
we need to clean up the election process

00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:22.079
so we are not left feeling the way we do

00:53:22.079 --> 00:53:23.839
today put laws in place to protect

00:53:23.839 --> 00:53:26.160
us against voter fraud flush out fake

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.359
votes okay so

00:53:27.359 --> 00:53:28.880
that's the [ __ ] reason they wanted to

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:32.079
go oh require id i don't like that

00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:34.319
um why you don't you don't bring it out

00:53:34.319 --> 00:53:35.359
we're gonna be able to vote

00:53:35.359 --> 00:53:36.480
now i just think it's hard for

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.400
minorities to get ids

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.079
you know i don't understand why they

00:53:40.079 --> 00:53:41.680
can't figure it out

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.599
no it's the five dollars for people but

00:53:43.599 --> 00:53:45.040
if you need it the government should get

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.319
to just give you one

00:53:46.319 --> 00:53:47.920
here's the easy fix because some people

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.000
believe these the state

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.359
issues [ __ ] ids and then yeah

00:53:53.359 --> 00:53:55.599
and then you know like but that's on

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:57.119
purpose to keep people

00:53:57.119 --> 00:54:00.079
from voting um okay so let's look at

00:54:00.079 --> 00:54:00.960
this great article

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.160
another one from seth simon

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.400

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.319
just to refresh everybody why

00:54:08.319 --> 00:54:12.000
this uh this dogged [ __ ] industry

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.559
gadfly seth simons can i just say that

00:54:14.559 --> 00:54:16.160

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:23.440
mcginnis

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.200

an accurate depiction of the comedy can

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.760
you imagine playing this gig that would

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.440
be the most terrifying gig

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.720
if you were to play where somebody has

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.119
visible tattoos by the looks of what

00:54:53.119 --> 00:54:54.799

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.200
coming from

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.680
so after that amazing thing that he did

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.319
he dedicated himself to policing

01:02:28.319 --> 01:02:30.960
better comedians all right so put the

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.599
article back

01:02:31.599 --> 01:02:34.799
up because he spent the last five years

01:02:34.799 --> 01:02:37.200
wait escape or double click okay writing

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.400
about the comedy industry

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.559
the last three or so covering inequality

01:02:40.559 --> 01:02:42.160
and extremism within it

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.319
yeah so the first two years the first

01:02:44.319 --> 01:02:45.760
two years he was writing like

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.440
he was trying his best to like actually

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.359
write reviews like he would like

01:02:49.359 --> 01:02:51.440
he like interviewed big j he interviewed

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.559
a bunch of our friends

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:54.559
as a community comedy journalist yeah

01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:56.160
okay and then

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.000
the you know he even says here the last

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.319
three years he's switched over to

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:02.400
inequality and extremism within stand-up

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.520
company

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.079
so he mixed his failure at this with yes

01:03:06.079 --> 01:03:07.760
he even failed at writing he failed at

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.359
trying to do comedy and then he failed

01:03:09.359 --> 01:03:11.200
as a writer so then he became a [ __ ]

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:11.920
click bait

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.160
like he's a communist now he switched to

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.440
being a communist

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.760
three years um three years ago yeah but

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.839
it's like

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:21.920
like yeah that's ostensibly it's like

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.280
he's a con but it's not that he's a

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.559
communist it's that

01:03:24.559 --> 01:03:26.240
yeah it's not even about that it's about

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.920
his personal [ __ ] it's always the

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.520
same with these dudes and jamie kilstein

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.720
who you know

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.280
who had his period where he was this guy

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.799
and then before they ran him out

01:03:34.799 --> 01:03:36.880
he said i wanted to harm comedy because

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.240
i thought i didn't like get what i

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.599
should out of it he told me like what

01:03:39.599 --> 01:03:40.400
the motive was

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.119
that's this guy so okay so something

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:44.240
broke his [ __ ]

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.559
spoken bird heart okay so wait uh

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:50.240
this periodically brought me in contact

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.680
with some of the leading lights in the

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.720
scene's tran

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.760
transgressive edge oh my goodness

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.880
transgressive comedy the worst kind

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.319
the place where popular mainstream

01:04:00.319 --> 01:04:02.559
comedy bleeds into the kind of

01:04:02.559 --> 01:04:04.720
right-wing politics that animated the

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.039
capital riot last month

01:04:07.039 --> 01:04:10.559

it's a place hostile to prying eyes oh

01:04:17.359 --> 01:04:18.559
why would it be when you

01:04:18.559 --> 01:04:21.599
are trying to pin the capital riot on i

01:04:21.599 --> 01:04:22.160
mean

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.520

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.440
where he's like i've been harassed

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.599

01:04:27.599 --> 01:04:29.280
to my harassment of people

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.400

to bring us this

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.559

01:04:50.559 --> 01:04:52.559
message board where toxic cysts white

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:09.760
hilarious

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.079
against me is what he says it's always

01:05:12.079 --> 01:05:13.200

01:05:26.319 --> 01:05:28.000
constellation

and discord groups

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.240

all over the comedy world goddamn

01:05:39.359 --> 01:05:41.280
before i take you down my particular

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.200
rabbit hole it's worth establishing the

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.280
many ways in which the worlds of comedy

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.920
and the racist right overlap and

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.440
reinforce each other

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.000
the recent comedy boom is popular

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.839
popularly understood as an era in which

01:05:55.839 --> 01:05:57.760
new forms of media like podcasts

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.760
and streaming video created massive new

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.200
audiences blah blah blah

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.559
which in turn created massive new

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:04.480
revenue streams for comedians and at the

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.240
same time the artificial intimacy of

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.240
these platforms allowed fans to feel a

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.760
level of connection with their favorite

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:10.880
performers

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.839
okay that converge on cultish duh okay

01:06:13.839 --> 01:06:15.200
yes

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.319
um comedians have fans

01:06:18.319 --> 01:06:20.160
right this is let's not let's curt let's

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.440
not read this whole [ __ ]

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.720
i'm trying to get to the good part okay

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.920
so this was not simply an area of

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.119
glorious bounty which little known

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:30.480
communities could land massive netflix

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.400
paydays or leapfrog from ucb

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.480
comedy to college humor to lucrative

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.000
sitcom writing gigs that's what he never

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.760
did that's what he's mad about

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.240
uh it was also the era of walled off

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.240
subcultures like uniforms which could

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.000
transform into real violent political

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:44.799
factions

01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:46.640
especially at a time when comedy was

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.000
increasingly pitted

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.359
against the forces of political

01:06:49.359 --> 01:06:51.680
correctness he's saying that as

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:55.359
that's bad to be so

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.359
um let's see the mod that descended on

01:06:57.359 --> 01:06:58.720
washington dc so somehow this is

01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.599
connected

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:01.920
to comedy and somehow we are all

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.359
connected

01:07:03.359 --> 01:07:05.440
well if one comedian like if you're in

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.640
new york for a long time you know

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.200
everybody

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.799
gavin is the founder of vice magazine

01:07:08.799 --> 01:07:10.240
gavin mcginnis that he's bringing up to

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.839
try to like connect

01:07:11.839 --> 01:07:14.079
the [ __ ] dots like lots of us did

01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:15.359
opie and anthony and we know anthony

01:07:15.359 --> 01:07:16.240
comey

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.599
yeah um and like you know

01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:20.960
kevin i always like to have him but

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.640
gavin's like an [ __ ] i don't i don't

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.839
sign off on any of the uh the things of

01:07:25.839 --> 01:07:27.680
you know in fact i think he [ __ ] had

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.359
to give up on his dumb thoughts like you

01:07:29.359 --> 01:07:31.039
know who else had a compound show

01:07:31.039 --> 01:07:34.480
neil degrasse tyson it's like what are

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.920
we [ __ ] doing here yeah

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.000
kumia from opie anthony he had that like

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.400
okay so go down a little bit

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.839
it's he's blathering he's basically

01:07:41.839 --> 01:07:43.520
trying to do a six degrees of kevin

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.400
bacon

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.760
oh here we go here we go up up up up up

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.480
up up up okay

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.760
the gavin mcguinness show

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.240
oh so this is how gavin mcginnis use

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.520
used his platform

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.680
on compound media to mingle with a

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.359
revolving door of respected even

01:07:59.359 --> 01:08:00.559
mainstream comics

01:08:00.559 --> 01:08:04.480
people like big j okerson

01:08:05.119 --> 01:08:08.319
i call him big alt-right jay yeah

01:08:08.319 --> 01:08:11.280
justy dodge mike lawrence who is justin

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.640
dodge that big a name that we

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.960
larry the cable guy joe mataris tom

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.199
chalu dave hill alonzo baden

01:08:17.199 --> 01:08:19.600
louis gomez and dave smith it sounds

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.960
like snl

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:24.400
yeah none of whom were deterred by

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.600
mckinnon's friendliness with white

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.480
supremacists

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.359
so some these people all talk to him at

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.120
one time or another

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.480
but most of them probably haven't talked

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.719
to mcgavin in a long time

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:38.719
but they just did once

01:08:38.719 --> 01:08:42.640
okay and then he's after louis j gomez

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.799
uh and it also really sucks for us that

01:08:44.799 --> 01:08:47.040
lewis is our spokesman

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.120
okay wait no yeah how do you think we

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.080
feel yeah

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.719
you think we like when lewis says this

01:08:52.719 --> 01:08:54.239
lewis said when you come

01:08:54.239 --> 01:08:55.759
when you come to watch the legion skank

01:08:55.759 --> 01:08:57.359
show you should be hearing racist sex

01:08:57.359 --> 01:08:58.319
defensive [ __ ]

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:00.159
if you're upset about it don't watch the

01:09:00.159 --> 01:09:02.159
show i actually

01:09:02.159 --> 01:09:04.080
cannot stand that louis says that [ __ ] i

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.159
can't stand it but guess what uh

01:09:06.159 --> 01:09:08.159
i'd rather have the crowds that come to

01:09:08.159 --> 01:09:09.839
those shows any [ __ ] day of the week

01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:11.679
besides this [ __ ] mania they're

01:09:11.679 --> 01:09:13.520
always good comedy crowds

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.640
like he thinks his puerto rican-ness can

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.719
like cover him

01:09:18.719 --> 01:09:20.560
way past what again that's where where

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.400
that like

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.040
and i i want to say i've never been edgy

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.080
like

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.520
you know somebody tell you an edgy [ __ ]

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:29.199
like i i've never

01:09:29.199 --> 01:09:31.040
said that about my nor if i ever thought

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.359
i was or tried to be i [ __ ] hate that

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:34.960
[ __ ] yeah it's kind of embarrassing it's

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.839
it is embarrassing to be an edgy guy

01:09:37.839 --> 01:09:39.600
yeah it's like an actual good insult

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.239
that hurts my feelings when people yeah

01:09:42.239 --> 01:09:45.440
you know and i'm not ashamed to say that

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.359
to az in front of uh with a thanos

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:50.319
sculpture in the background

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.520
uh let's see oh here's a plug see this

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.719
is why i'm getting jealous now

01:09:54.719 --> 01:09:56.000
today legion of skanks holds

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.080
considerable sway and comedy with a

01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.840
massive platform

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.679
it's lent everyone who's anyone in the

01:10:01.679 --> 01:10:03.199
new york comedy club scene while

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:05.440
remaining true to its far right

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.159
to like any one of these dummies does it

01:10:08.159 --> 01:10:09.440
dave's the only guy i know who thinks

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.640
about politics

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.520
yeah over that whole group lewis was not

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.480
ever a political guy

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.960
jay doesn't know any like are you

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.280
kidding me

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:23.040
uh let's see keep going down

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.400
keep going down keep going down i think

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.760
it's i think it's pretty clear what

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.800
happened is

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.040
i think it's the left has inserted

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.800
itself so hard

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.600
like into our lives as far as like this

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.960
is what you can say this is what you

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.719
can't say so when you speak out against

01:10:38.719 --> 01:10:40.159
them against the left

01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:42.239
everyone just assumes you're right

01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:43.600
you're right-wing yeah

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.280
it's just not the case you're also

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.600
assuming left also like

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.520
that's the thing true it's there's not

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:51.440
america doesn't have a left i mean 100 i

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.640
believe that america doesn't really have

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.679
a left i mean

01:10:53.679 --> 01:10:55.760
like in europe they have that like a

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.679
left but america is just all reactionary

01:10:57.679 --> 01:10:59.360
so that's why they all do the same [ __ ]

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.280
that's why they all censor and they're

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.199
all the same kind of [ __ ] people

01:11:03.199 --> 01:11:05.040
what you're you're talking about is the

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.800
lifestyle left which i didn't come up

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.159
with that phrase but it's a good

01:11:08.159 --> 01:11:09.760
description of it

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.360
and that's what seth tried to do like be

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.000
a hipster and do like improv and

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.480
he's lifestyle left and the thing that

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.600
makes them not

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.800
communist you're not supposed to

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:22.000
literally hate the working man

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.719
like they despise that okay in fact they

01:11:24.719 --> 01:11:25.280
be met

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.679
this is all how dare somebody talk to

01:11:27.679 --> 01:11:28.960
somebody one time

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.880
you spoke to them and you didn't [ __ ]

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.120
i've decided that they should be

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.040
set aside like anybody that's my friend

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.719
even if they say a terrible thing

01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:37.840
if i think they're wrong i'll tell them

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.520
it's wrong and why would i throw a

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.159
friend away

01:11:40.159 --> 01:11:42.239
because this is a [ __ ] passed a judgment

01:11:42.239 --> 01:11:43.199
you know

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:46.400
who gives a [ __ ] he interviewed jay he

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.400
interviewed jay what was his interview

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.600
with jay like i don't know it was

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.760
probably like a q a about his [ __ ]

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.800
upcoming special but in his world

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:58.320
that means he worked with a nazi

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.239
it's so funny because jay couldn't mor

01:12:00.239 --> 01:12:01.520
jay looks like

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.679
the next lesbian to be wear the batwoman

01:12:03.679 --> 01:12:06.239
suit on the show

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:07.920
jay couldn't look any more like a

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.840
futuristic his logic there is if you do

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.280
an interview with these guys or do a

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.880
podcast with these guys you're one of

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:13.600
them

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.760
meanwhile when he was working before he

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.120
got into

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.040
inequality and extremism or whatever the

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.480
[ __ ] he said

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.560
he was doing it within the last five

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.320
years so i'm not you know whatever

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.560
no he's but that's the thing that he's

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.760
turning in

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.600
for the blacklist he's turning in he's

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.199
being a good citizen that's why he gets

01:12:31.199 --> 01:12:32.239
off

01:12:32.239 --> 01:12:33.679
i forgot so this is where they bring up

01:12:33.679 --> 01:12:36.640
cringe so cringe comedy was a thing that

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:37.600
there's a very good club called the

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.400
stand in new york and the guys that used

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.080
to have a website that

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.520
ended up owning the club is called

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.360
cringe comedy and uh

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.040
they were just comedy fans that would

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.480
okay now i

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.159
personally have never enjoyed the name

01:12:50.159 --> 01:12:51.520
cringe comedy okay

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.400
it actually makes me cringe however it's

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.199
gay

01:12:55.199 --> 01:12:59.040
it's almost as gay as legalized comedy

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.080
i'm just getting incredibly happy at the

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.360
the amount

calling them came in and colonized

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.800
and that's what they do with your fandom

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.840
and it's like uh it's really something

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.239
like also

01:14:28.239 --> 01:14:30.239
i should say this also i really try to

01:14:30.239 --> 01:14:32.640
avoid talking about this stuff

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.280
what you really philly is that violence

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.480
no the [ __ ]

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.239
seth simon stuff it only it's it's just

01:14:40.239 --> 01:14:42.480

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.560

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.560
about these doors i tweeted it dude and

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.320
i don't care about these dorks but those

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.080
[ __ ] [ __ ] ass comics they

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.159
suck [ __ ] that okay so here's what i

01:14:58.159 --> 01:14:59.199
don't know

01:14:59.199 --> 01:15:01.440
do you know anthony jeselnik no the

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.480
comic

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.400
no i know his oh sorry you never heard

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.600
of him no

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.040
he used to have a show called the jeslek

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.840
offensive it sounds like

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:12.400
masturbatory it is but he was a guy

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.520
who's offensive comic

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.199
like okay so one point two million it's

01:15:17.199 --> 01:15:17.679
my fault

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:19.920
he tweeted this like and i don't know

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.239
why i'm now my guess is maybe lewis at

01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:23.600
some point tweeted at him and

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.120
pissed you know that's what my guess is

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.800
is some social no he

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.719
he trashed me as well when i got fired

01:15:28.719 --> 01:15:31.120
he trashed me pretty hard

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.679
um yeah he that's really like that i

01:15:33.679 --> 01:15:35.600
don't get this and i'll get like

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.800
jeff jim jeffries he [ __ ] like

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.400
had the big woke turn around for his

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.920
[ __ ] how he pulled that off is

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:44.320
unbelievable

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.840
yeah i mean they're just going for it

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.320
they might you know

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:52.239
but yeah i just it's crazy to to

01:15:52.239 --> 01:15:54.480
it's whatever i mean [ __ ] it who cares

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.000
what's this like

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.320
is he meant to be a comic yeah he's an

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.480
edgy he's an edgy comic he does like

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.280
one-liners

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.760
he's a bigger name than i am for sure

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.199
he's bigger than both of us

01:16:05.199 --> 01:16:07.920
but i think that i think that time's at

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.080
an end i don't know too many

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.239
people give a [ __ ] about what he's doing

01:16:12.239 --> 01:16:14.080
dude always got along with them like

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.520
i'm not like like like i said anybody's

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.320
tweets

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.400
i withhold a lot of unless it's like

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.719
really virulent like i withhold

01:16:22.719 --> 01:16:24.719
because people tweet all kinds of [ __ ]

01:16:24.719 --> 01:16:27.040
yeah and you know like patton oswalt i

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.640
like that guy a lot and he's a twitter

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.320
addict though and people [ __ ] hate

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.360
his guts

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.880
it's like look he's just tweeting like

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.679
it's the same thing i will say this like

01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:38.320
when when anthony jeselnik talks [ __ ] on

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.920
me when i was getting fired i kind of

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.520
gave him the benefit of the doubt as far

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.560
as like being like

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.000
he's never he doesn't know who the [ __ ]

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.600
i am he's never heard of me he's just

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.760
his argument is that i'm not funny which

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.600
if all you'd ever seen of me was that

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.320
clip

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.000
it's not the craziest remark to make

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.440
like i wasn't like

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.440
listening to that show got cancelled

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.199
because he celebrated people getting

01:16:57.199 --> 01:16:58.880
eaten by [ __ ] sharks

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.080
the day after it happened like that's a

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.080
little bit more of a line cross

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.320
than anything out of context horseshit

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.840
from a [ __ ] podcast

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.280
so he should know better he should know

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:12.880
better okay but once you get a certain

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.400
like a bunch of people who made their

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.280
money being like i'm transgressive

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.800
okay and he's always a great joke writer

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.800
with a good comic they have a thing of

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:21.440
like

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.760
now you guys need to clean up your act

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.440
like they want to close the door up

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.640
like everybody who's going to make their

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.239
money off something entertaining is so

01:17:28.239 --> 01:17:29.520
that's why for example

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.360
the daily show how do you think trevor

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.280
noah became the guy in the daily show

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.280
jon stewart picked him

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.640
okay because he never wanted anybody

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.120
better than him to do his [ __ ]

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.280
yeah he wanted to suck that's what this

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.239
so now all this [ __ ] is so conglomerate

01:17:44.239 --> 01:17:45.920
it's the very opposite of communism it's

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.760
giant corporations control everything

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:48.960
from top down

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.480
so [ __ ] like the nerd [ __ ] as always

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.480
followed as i started watching the show

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.400
that's their place to experiment with

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.760
these kind of agendas and [ __ ] they're

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.000
like

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.159
well nobody cares what nerds like let's

01:18:00.159 --> 01:18:01.199
inject this into the

01:18:01.199 --> 01:18:02.560
because they're toxic and they need to

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:05.920
be taught a lesson and like

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.440
and it needs to be taken away from them

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.719
and given to an action of people who

01:18:08.719 --> 01:18:09.440
didn't ask for

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.679
you know that that that fool's errand of

01:18:11.679 --> 01:18:13.360
like star wars is going to be for girls

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.120
now

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.880
my sister in the movie she was not

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.800
affected like i was by star wars okay

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.840
and my nieces

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.280
are not affected they don't give a [ __ ]

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.800
about that they're girls

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.719
she star wars girl figures like rey and

01:18:28.719 --> 01:18:29.280
[ __ ]

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.280
she just makes them kiss the boy dolls

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.400
that's what she does with them because

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.679
she's a little girl

01:18:33.679 --> 01:18:36.400
that's what she likes that's that's the

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.600
majority of girl

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:38.960
truthfully that's what everyone's doing

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.719
with the red dolls but the girls that do

01:18:40.719 --> 01:18:41.120
like

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.159
it even say what yeah

01:18:44.159 --> 01:18:47.520
nothing i i get the two-ray girl

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.400
i get the two because they came yeah i

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.400
get the two rays to kiss themselves

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.520
bit of [ __ ] double trouble in it yeah

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.520
you spin it around that's a great wow

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.360
that's a fantastic racist

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:04.560
racism that was essentially a pathetic

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.520
london accent and i'm from yorkshire i'm

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.480
from europe

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:12.159
that was just like me i'm an american

01:19:12.159 --> 01:19:12.719
man

01:19:12.719 --> 01:19:13.840
well that's the point of it i'm not

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.360
trying to do it well it's funnier if you

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.560
don't do it well

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:20.080
if you're like oh from [ __ ] england

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.679
it's funny if you put your heart into it

01:19:21.679 --> 01:19:23.920
it could have now been something special

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:27.520
i'm not going to put my heart into it

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.400
i don't know if you did learn the accent

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.679
you sounded like you're just

01:19:31.679 --> 01:19:34.239
like a harry potter in that one yeah you

01:19:34.239 --> 01:19:36.400
don't

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:41.040
don't you look like shane you look like

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.280
a guard in like braveheart

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.120
who gets like gets to spear through him

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.800
while he's just standing there yeah

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.880
not looking yeah you're like what

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.199
dude literally my favorite scene in

01:19:53.199 --> 01:19:54.400
almost any movie is

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.080
the first scene in braveheart when they

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.679
attack that fort

01:19:57.679 --> 01:20:00.880
yeah the dad remember uh

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.400
the dad that hangs out with the group

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.400
the old guy who's a wild man

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.760
i think it's right after he gets like

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.600
his hand chopped off or something

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.920
anyway he just launches a [ __ ] spear

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.120
and there's literally a guard that's

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:13.040
like

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.560
just standing at the top of this tower

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.320
not looking just connects

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.960
right in his gun

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.120
it's not like you're getting attacked by

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.880
you know yeah there's a horde of mad

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:29.440
scotsman or anything like that no just

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.040
chilling up here i'll be right

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.679
[ __ ] going on over there by the way

01:20:33.679 --> 01:20:35.120
isn't braveheart like

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.280
not one part of that it was historically

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:39.360
like all over the place

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.320
yeah yeah it was actually racist at the

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.840
same time and

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:46.080
the the um the woman he falls in love

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.120
with in the film

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.840
she's like 12 in real life you gotta

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:50.639
leave that out

01:20:50.639 --> 01:20:53.120
always especially in historical movies

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:53.760
so you know

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.080
you don't you don't have to let history

01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.360
get in the way

01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.520
of a good historical film well you have

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.000
to tell me i was a minister i mean jesus

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.040
jesus mom was 13.

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.800
all these all these stories are like

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.159
you're like look it was like

01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:10.639
but it was a virgin birth so nobody

01:21:10.639 --> 01:21:12.000
touched her

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.480
i mean like that's even more horrible

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.960
that seems even more horrible

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:19.840
like like a virgin birth of a i mean

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.080
it's

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.760
insane but i guess look i don't know how

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.000
long people lived back then probably not

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.280
probably about twenty-five probably

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:28.080
middle age by the time you were 13 there

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.400
like really an old maid she was going

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.280
through menopause

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.840
crucifixion was like a crucifixion was

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.560
like a leading cause of death back then

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.400
they would like line highways with

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.639
people

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:58.239
uh yeah fire uh i mean i

01:21:58.239 --> 01:22:01.679
yeah fire was like special occasions

01:22:01.679 --> 01:22:04.000
yeah ted would catch and the whole group

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.199
you know uh nero

01:22:05.199 --> 01:22:06.800
the guy who support he didn't fiddle in

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.480
rome burn but i heard that

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.560
he would he he would went past nailing

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.000
people across he would light him on fire

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.120
to light up he had everybody come over

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.560
for a party

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.880
and just like like road warrior the

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.719
second one

01:22:18.719 --> 01:22:20.480
they just blew people on fire and like

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.840
always one thing about the crucifixion

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.120
which is which is which is

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:26.320
kind of like made me scratch my head a

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.040
little bit

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.199
so that's just like the one thing about

01:22:29.199 --> 01:22:30.239
the crucifixion

01:22:30.239 --> 01:22:31.840
yeah it's always kind of made me sort of

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.679
go

01:22:33.679 --> 01:22:36.159
i'm not sure that actually happened is

01:22:36.159 --> 01:22:37.760
when uh jews was just like can i have

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.000
some

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.840
water you know i'm down on the cross

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.520
here probably wrong

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.239
i could do with a drink i don't know you

01:22:44.239 --> 01:22:44.800
know it's

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.520
probably inappropriate for alcohol right

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.000
because

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
i'll start singing and it's not gonna be

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.199
good so just

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:54.080
some refreshing water and they whack up

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.760
a sponge of vinegar

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:59.199
who who brings vinegar to a crucifixion

01:22:59.199 --> 01:23:02.239
i mean that's an extra talk about like

01:23:02.239 --> 01:23:04.159
having a bad day and then like i'll

01:23:04.159 --> 01:23:05.679
bring you the opposite of what you asked

01:23:05.679 --> 01:23:07.760
for

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.080
just stop there like how would you like

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.679
something that's almost painfully not

01:23:11.679 --> 01:23:13.679
refreshing at this moment

01:23:13.679 --> 01:23:17.600
okay or a sponge or vinegar what if it

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.960
i've had a thought is there a reason for

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.199
i'll give her some wine you know because

01:23:25.199 --> 01:23:27.040
i know he's just like water but if i

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.560
give him a bit wider he'll take the edge

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.520
off

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.440
it'll numb the pain a little bit yeah

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.040
but he's left there he's left the wine

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:33.520
out

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.000
for you know [ __ ] days on end and it

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.520
just turns like vinegar [ __ ]

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:41.360
sounds piss so you're saying it was

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.000
wine that had spoiled i listen i've read

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.440
the bible many times not

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.400
you know by choice but i have and i

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:48.960
don't remember

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.960
the part that part but i i trust your

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.080
scholarship i don't you think i'm

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.360
doubting

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.280
you know i do defer to your scholarship

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.480
on this

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.719
some stuck some vinegar up on him i

01:23:58.719 --> 01:24:00.080
think that's the british i think that's

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.600
the anglican dude

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:02.800
i don't remember i went to catholic

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.239
school i don't remember that [ __ ]

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:05.440
vinegar

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.040
you could have had a fish and chip no if

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.480
you had fish and you said i don't want

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.360
to water

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.080
do you have any fish and chips and they

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:12.800
and they and he

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.120
put up some fish and chips and then then

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.159

01:24:28.639 --> 01:24:30.320
when i was out there

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.159
well you know he created the loaves and

01:24:32.159 --> 01:24:33.760

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.120

we were colonizing we were getting

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.080
[ __ ] raped by norwegians

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.960

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.880
taking it up the dirt box by norwegians

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.040
on a rage on a daily basis that's

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.239
metaphorically uh

01:24:54.239 --> 01:24:57.520
a good way to put it yeah literally

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.239
because there was

01:24:58.239 --> 01:25:02.239

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:05.679
was pretty much

01:25:05.679 --> 01:25:08.719
it yeah it's a

01:25:08.719 --> 01:25:12.239
holiday time to be alive sure

they couldn't open their business and it

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.440

oh oh yeah you should be in there

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.880
i was last time but because you know why

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.719
i had mike cernovich on the show

01:26:04.719 --> 01:26:06.880
and he's on the no he's on the forbidden

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.639
list to in this

01:26:08.639 --> 01:26:11.199
to this guy but i'm already on a [ __ ]

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:12.800
list so like what

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.840
yeah who am i going to hang out with

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.040
like some other people on this

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.719
those are the best people yeah it's a

01:26:20.719 --> 01:26:22.320
bit of a no-win situation really isn't

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.199
it

01:26:23.199 --> 01:26:25.120
yeah well that's the point that's what

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.040
they want they literally want

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.520
a no-win situation but then you then

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.719
you've got a group of you

01:26:30.719 --> 01:26:33.040
who are on the [ __ ] list so like what

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:34.080
should we do

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.560
start a club i start around a little

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:37.199
club

01:26:37.199 --> 01:26:39.280
start dressing the same he goes back to

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.400
the start there's just like these

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.840
[ __ ] wankers

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.600
started they have to crack down on that

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.360
because that led to the violence

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.120
the animal house style party at the

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.520
capitol um transgressions

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.840
so but in other con like as i understand

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.679
in europe while there's lockdowns aren't

01:26:53.679 --> 01:26:55.040
they like giving you guys

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:58.239
like money so you're not no

01:26:58.239 --> 01:27:00.159
they know england doesn't give like a

01:27:00.159 --> 01:27:02.000
some kind of [ __ ] something

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.840
no germany doesn't

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.440
if they have too many people in their

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.679
house yeah what i'm asking is when they

01:27:09.679 --> 01:27:11.679
shut the business down are they giving

01:27:11.679 --> 01:27:14.400
like you know money to people so they're

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:14.960
not like

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.320
because there's like [ __ ] food lines

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.159
and this is crazy what's going on people

01:27:18.159 --> 01:27:19.440
all those people in the capital by the

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.760
way that rioted you know 60 of them

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.760
were uh no they were [ __ ] uh people

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:26.880
with like tax lien

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.320
people who are [ __ ] who don't have

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.600
insurance and like they're like poor

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.159
people

01:27:30.159 --> 01:27:32.639
and america ain't gonna do [ __ ] that's

01:27:32.639 --> 01:27:34.159
why i say we don't have a [ __ ] left

01:27:34.159 --> 01:27:35.600
here the democrats

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.440
what they want what this guy says simon

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.800
the lifestyle thing wants

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.080
is to keep uh your your garbage so

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.280
now we don't have to worry about paying

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.480
for healthcare for everyone because most

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:47.199
of the people are just deplorable anyway

01:27:47.199 --> 01:27:48.960
that's what the the goal is it's to feel

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.880
like you're left without having to do

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:51.920
because these are rich people that are

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.280
into this [ __ ] and they don't want to

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.880
pay all these tech billionaires that are

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.159
like liberal they don't want to pay for

01:27:56.159 --> 01:28:01.840
people's [ __ ]

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:07.120
yeah right being just being just poor

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:07.840
now

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:10.719
i can waste your time man yeah don't

01:28:10.719 --> 01:28:11.280
don't

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.320
have you met poor people

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.679
mechanicsburg pennsylvania i grew up in

01:28:23.679 --> 01:28:25.600
the middle of the state

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.199
so you go is it it might be the

01:28:27.199 --> 01:28:30.400
equivalent of where az is from

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.719
in the uk it might be like roughly the

01:28:32.719 --> 01:28:33.760
equivalent kind of i don't think they

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.760
have mechanicsburgs in the uk

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.159
they have why do you say that because

01:28:38.159 --> 01:28:41.520
it's kind of it's in like appalachia

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:43.120
it's in like the appalachian mountains i

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.040
mean these just like words

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.719
it's like welsh people basically it's

01:28:46.719 --> 01:28:48.560
the same yorkshire that's a what

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.560
i'll tell you i played nottingham what

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:52.960

you started running around people and

01:28:54.719 --> 01:28:57.040

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.440
well first of all you need to go down

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.040
through northumberland

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.400
and then from northumberland you need to

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.159
come across to cumbria once you've gone

01:29:36.159 --> 01:29:37.199
through cumbria

01:29:37.199 --> 01:29:39.840
you need to go through

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:41.520
the whole area once you've gone through

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:42.560
the whole area you've got north

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.679
yorkshire and then you've got

01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:44.880
east yorkshire and then you've got will

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.120
there be a roundabout on the way there

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.800

will drive

01:29:54.239 --> 01:29:55.520
you're getting three miles in a circle

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.760
to go to that next spot

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:00.639
and that's just how it's crazy yeah but

01:30:00.639 --> 01:30:02.480
it's a good spot

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:05.120
um um i don't remember what else i

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.199

they're like why are these people crazy

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.560

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.080
lockdowns because you they have to

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:37.199

01:30:37.199 --> 01:30:38.800
getting [ __ ] sick to do their [ __ ]

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.280

there's just barely a thing open

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.400
no we don't know because we're all

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.239
[ __ ] locked in it was great because

01:30:54.239 --> 01:30:54.719
there was

01:30:54.719 --> 01:30:56.880
there was a couple of days ago uh there

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:59.120
was an article on the bbc or sky news

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.000
one of the two

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.080
and it was just like bryn is just about

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:03.120
to experience

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.320
an unbelievable surge as covert

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.080
is that it's it's worse and then the day

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.000
after it's like every case is uh

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.920
down yeah right it's just like

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.520
we don't we don't know what the we don't

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:18.159

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.880
she got like uglier

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.719
because she got older so everyone's like

01:35:28.719 --> 01:35:30.719
she's out of her [ __ ] mind

01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:31.760
that's the thing after the

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.679
conservatorship she made like a big

01:35:33.679 --> 01:35:35.280
comeback and made 58 million dollars and

01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:36.719
was like back in shape and looked good

01:35:36.719 --> 01:35:37.119
and like

01:35:37.119 --> 01:35:40.239
was it in vegas and so it's kind of

01:35:40.239 --> 01:35:41.520
arguing against it but it's like it

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:42.719
looks like her life totally turned

01:35:42.719 --> 01:35:44.480
around with this

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:45.920
with this service it looks like it's

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:47.520
totally making things go really well for

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:48.560
her

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.320
but there's a bunch of fans that they

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.719
have a q a on conspiracy about her

01:35:52.719 --> 01:35:54.960
like that every instagram is a code

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:46.560
series

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:50.080
yeah and then somebody twunks it and

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:51.840

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.880
you know throwing the ball at them quite

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:03.440
quickly

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:05.040
you know a bit nasty slow it down a bit

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.719
so i can hit it and then they just

01:41:06.719 --> 01:41:08.880
[ __ ] talk

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:11.520
it's not police yeah and then this is so

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:12.960
boring as [ __ ] by the way i cannot watch

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.639
american baseball yeah they suppose

01:41:14.639 --> 01:41:16.239
baseball's like the most it's like

01:41:16.239 --> 01:41:18.480
horrendous because it's just like right

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.800
we're gonna get some [ __ ] guy

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:25.040
to stand on a mound so he's above you

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:28.000
he's gonna throw a [ __ ] ball that's

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.040
rock hard

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.280
as fast as he can yeah it hurts

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:32.960
sometimes at your head because he's a

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.000
[ __ ]

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.639
yeah and and you gotta [ __ ] smack

01:41:36.639 --> 01:41:37.600
that ball you gotta

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:38.960
you're making it sound awesome by the

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.639
way yeah i'm making it

01:41:40.639 --> 01:41:41.840
i've never enjoyed it until i heard you

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.320
describe it just now i'm describing the

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.320
good bit well gets the bad bit

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.239
you can also fight at any time thrown it

01:41:48.239 --> 01:41:49.360
down which so it's coming from a

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:50.960
downward trajectory so it's going to

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:53.199
have gravity on its side as well

01:41:53.199 --> 01:41:55.600
yeah right there's momentum and you've

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:56.880
got it you've got to pick it you've got

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.400
to see this you've got to pick it you've

01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.920
got to see the swerve you've got yeah

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.840
and then you've got a twinkie

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:05.520
and then [ __ ] wankers make you run

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.280
yeah well if you hit a foreign so after

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:08.880
you do all the hard stuff it's just

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:11.520
you're just like yes hit the ball that

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:12.960
was like such a

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:16.239
feat of human ingenuity

01:42:16.239 --> 01:42:18.000
and then some guy next year you got a

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.920
[ __ ] you gotta [ __ ] run in a [ __ ]

01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:22.320
circle i want you to know this is the

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.480

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.480
yeah babe ruth was just like he didn't

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:38.080

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
dignified i would say house of lords

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:20.480
talk

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:22.000

each other the dignified older one

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:27.119
that's that's the impression i got from

01:47:27.119 --> 01:47:28.080
the statesman

01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:29.920

were you more of a peasant

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.080

01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:39.760

vinegar crisps and it was getting on the

01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.480
nerves

01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.280

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:50.000
lowest debt

yeah see some some overlords yes

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:57.119
is it bad to say up the raw over there

01:48:57.119 --> 01:49:00.480
rod the ira um

01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:02.480
well they do blow up babies it's

01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.679

01:49:03.679 --> 01:49:05.199
yeah but you guys blow up a lot more

01:49:05.199 --> 01:49:06.719
babies

01:49:06.719 --> 01:49:10.639
first of all before they did

01:49:10.639 --> 01:49:13.040
so technically we're better and lately

01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:15.119
we've been blown up the most babies we

01:49:15.119 --> 01:49:17.520

01:49:27.199 --> 01:49:28.639
chance i think you should look into it

01:49:28.639 --> 01:49:30.639
and you might just be surprised

01:49:30.639 --> 01:49:32.560

01:49:48.239 --> 01:49:49.920
unbelievably the next day [ __ ] twin

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:51.760
towers got blowed up

01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:53.920
um well i was gonna say there was no

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.280
isis but i guess there was just your

01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:56.000
daughter isis

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.520
at that daughter oh wait it's okay

01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:01.119
the problem was resolved because when

01:50:01.119 --> 01:50:03.280
they found out her name was was isis

01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:05.360
they stoned her to death well how about

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:06.719
your son

01:50:06.719 --> 01:50:11.040
is he okay is your son isil okay

01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:12.800
remember they're called ice in cell the

01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:14.639
sun's called insane

01:50:14.639 --> 01:50:18.239
yeah which is really problematic

01:50:18.239 --> 01:50:20.320
um because we're thinking you know a

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:21.520
name a word that

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:24.000
probably a lot of people haven't heard

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.920
uh what's the chances that it's going to

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:27.440
come into the public vernacular

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:30.800
you know little to nothing um so we call

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:32.159
him in the cell and then

01:50:32.159 --> 01:50:35.920
boof read it all over the place

01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.679
haha you're an in-cell and it's just

01:50:37.679 --> 01:50:40.719

01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:29.679
sex pest does but

01:54:29.679 --> 01:54:32.480
it's just if you're like a termite it's

01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:33.760
if you're five foot three

01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:35.760

01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:37.040
annoyed by you

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:39.679
so well if that exists that's his

01:54:39.679 --> 01:54:40.560
biggest crime

01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:42.159
if he does spoken bird comedy in him

01:54:42.159 --> 01:54:44.880
with his weird too close together eyes

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:48.239
i know i can't blame anybody that was

01:54:48.239 --> 01:54:50.400

01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:55.440
yeah uh yeah i mean yeah it was

01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:59.520
it was simon try not to laugh

01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:02.719
that's pretty funny i saw a video of his

01:55:02.719 --> 01:55:04.080
today that was very good

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.560
somebody sent it to me and i thought wow

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:07.119
wait he has

01:55:07.119 --> 01:55:08.960
other videos there's multiple videos you

01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:10.639
can find him because when he was young

01:55:10.639 --> 01:55:12.080
he was very young he was trying to do

01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:13.840
comedy he was trying to do like sketch

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:16.400
comedy and they're all

01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.400
extremely bad but you know everybody's

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:19.599
[ __ ] sucked when they were in college

01:55:19.599 --> 01:55:20.800
and they're making videos

01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:22.719
yeah especially when they're into improv

01:55:22.719 --> 01:55:24.719
but then when you grow up and start

01:55:24.719 --> 01:55:26.960
criticizing other people's stuff

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:29.280
well once it doesn't work out he okay i

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:30.159
read his stuff

01:55:30.159 --> 01:55:32.320
he has a whole article comparing him and

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:33.679
colin jost i don't know if you know he

01:55:33.679 --> 01:55:35.679
has it in for colin [ __ ] jokes i know

01:55:35.679 --> 01:55:36.719
he does

01:55:36.719 --> 01:55:39.679
yeah and and uh mike shay i don't know

01:55:39.679 --> 01:55:41.119
if he got the memo like mike shay's

01:55:41.119 --> 01:55:41.920
black dude

01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:43.920
i love mike shay because mike shea tells

01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:45.840
this guy to go [ __ ] himself all the time

01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:46.400
yeah

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:49.520
god bless mike so he [ __ ] uh

01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:53.280
uh uh uh has it in so here's a whole

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:55.920
essay about how colin joe's basically

01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:57.840
sold out

01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:59.119
like i remember colin just being a

01:55:59.119 --> 01:56:01.520
revolutionary anything like

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:03.920
and he goes and then he compared it with

01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:05.440
his story of new york of how he didn't

01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:07.280
go anywhere and then moved back

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:09.119
and basically the moral story is like he

01:56:09.119 --> 01:56:11.119
had his integrity unlike that sellout

01:56:11.119 --> 01:56:11.840
colin jost

01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:14.080
jesus christ this is he wrote this down

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:15.599
for you to read about himself that's how

01:56:15.599 --> 01:56:17.440

is

02:08:20.239 --> 02:08:22.159
are you going to piss time like the war

02:08:22.159 --> 02:08:24.000

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:39.119
yeah like drugs like all the [ __ ]

02:08:39.119 --> 02:08:40.320
horseshit so like

02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:43.280
when we're waging war on osama bin laden

02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:43.920
right

02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:46.239

02:08:46.239 --> 02:08:47.679
you get him

02:08:47.679 --> 02:08:51.280
it's like game over we won but

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:54.960
your wage war on an ideology you can't

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:57.360
kill an idea that's why batman's still

02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:59.119
going to have more movies made about him

02:08:59.119 --> 02:09:01.760
exactly because he wages the war on

02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:04.079
crime

02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:09.679
yeah i get plenty of work i get go out

02:09:09.679 --> 02:09:10.800

02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:14.400
[ __ ] out of people yeah right it's um

02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:16.719
a bit so they well they bring i think

02:09:16.719 --> 02:09:17.920
everybody got bored of the board we have

02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:18.880
so it's coming home

02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:20.639
so that's why all this [ __ ] you're gonna

02:09:20.639 --> 02:09:21.920
see

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:24.159
like he's that guy is a little weasel i

02:09:24.159 --> 02:09:25.760
mean he's a nothing i

02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:27.599
you welcome dude for talking about you

02:09:27.599 --> 02:09:29.280
if he ever hears this because

02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:30.800
i normally don't do it but i think he's

02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:32.800
special and i really enjoy

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:37.760
anyway uh it's [ __ ] amazing how uh uh

02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:39.520
there's like the leecher the leeches

02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:41.280
like capitalizing on that it became an

02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:42.480
industry so now it's like

02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:43.920
the same way you guys have that i love

02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:46.159
you have a channel or any of you guys

02:09:46.159 --> 02:09:48.000
doing the exact opposite because there

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.119
has to be some kind of checks and

02:09:49.119 --> 02:09:50.960
balances to this horse [ __ ] you know

02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:52.639
there just has to be i don't have to

02:09:52.639 --> 02:09:53.760
agree with that you don't want to watch

02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:54.880
this

02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:57.119
yeah they want to but they don't want

02:09:57.119 --> 02:09:59.199
somebody just to watch it

02:09:59.199 --> 02:10:01.280
they want somebody to go through the

02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:03.040
pain that they would have gone dude

02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:04.560
it's like you're eating spicy foods or

02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:06.079
something yeah you're eating super hot

02:10:06.079 --> 02:10:08.480

02:10:12.239 --> 02:10:15.199
the horrible spicy hot sauce right it's

02:10:15.199 --> 02:10:15.840
like

02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:29.119
[ __ ] tears coming down his face

and they haven't given him a glass of

02:10:30.639 --> 02:10:32.560
