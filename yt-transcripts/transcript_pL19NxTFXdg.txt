let you smoke changa right before you do

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.740
it as a prereq which is fair enough I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.000
just wanted to give you the experience

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.579
of smoking changa just like to set it up

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.259
like that dude they should start selling

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.520
that [ __ ] like they used to sell Salvia

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.320
I wouldn't petition I want to Lobby to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.259
bring like really insane quick

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.360
psychedelics but like they had salvia

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.159
legal and I think it's that was still

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.600
legal it's state to state is it really

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.520
yeah who do you think is like the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.320
governor who's like nah bro let's let

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.960
that happen PA won't let it do jerseys

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.759
it's just so funny for that to hit a

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.960
Governor's desk and like what are we

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.100
doing today he's like what's the deal

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.479
with Salvia I wonder if they make them

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.600
smoke it and he's like this is like

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.920
like states where it's legal so those

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.119
governors must have been like dude it's

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.119
actually chill if you prepare for it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.400
we know it's nuts it's all about sex no

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.379
it's not just Salvia like when you get

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.180
into all the research chemicals yeah

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.220
like not that Sally is a research

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.780
chemical I'm not gonna put that on I was

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.800
about to say I was about to stand up

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.080
yeah like that's a plan bro it's the oh

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.160
I think it's the oldest known

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.720
psychedelic I could be wrong Salvia

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.220
Salvia is like the first thing people

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.620
got ripped out oh my God you're being

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.540
like basically an animal and smoking

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.640
Salvia and just being like what the [ __ ]

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.700
but um ugh when you if you were to like

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.879
go online and Buy Research Chemicals

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.620
it'll be like illegal in Florida

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.260
Illinois it's like you'll pick the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.940
weirdest molecule are you talking about

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.019
swim no swim activity but like it'll be

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.060
illegal in like nine states and I'm like

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.879
how the [ __ ] did like four h-o-d-i-p-t

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.640
get illegal in Florida

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.260
and only for like what the [ __ ] happened

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.640
to him some dude probably did something

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.040
[ __ ] up in Delaware the Salvia thing

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.500
was a kid killed himself suicide letter

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.239
wrote about didn't you write about salvi

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.459
or something he had been smoking Salvia

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.319
but that's not he started running with

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.239
the wrong crowd no he just he killed

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.319
himself because he smoked salmon

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.819
realized he was better suited on the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.700
other side fair play yeah good point he

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.739
that was part of his mom tried to make

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.420

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.580
kill himself he's like no

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.239
not really he got the message

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.739
technically he had work to do right on

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.200
wait so he shed his he shed his [ __ ]

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.739
this Mortal coil yeah but it's like you

station drugs mom's a snitch

is Chill

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.280
yeah I would say New Jersey is like the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.780
Pine Barrens are cool yeah you haven't

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.100

Lakes yeah

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.080
Delaware sucks on like a depressing

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.000
level Jersey's like comically shitty

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.100
yeah yeah but Jersey has like

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.419
there's like little

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.180
in Jersey though yeah yeah Gardens

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.979
neighborhood's nice but there's spots in

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.660
Jersey that are genuinely nice Delaware

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.060
is like this flat [ __ ] Wasteland yeah

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.560
it's all that goes on until you get to

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.240
the beach and then the Delaware Beach is

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.340

in one area I won't take this one yeah

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.060
like the rest of like when you drive

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.560
from the top of Delaware to the bottom

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.180
it's the same thing until you get to the

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.940
ocean yeah it's just a flat [ __ ]

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.400

differently like once you get down like

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.320
Smyrna and [ __ ] they're all true the

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.180
wild thing was when Zeus ran away Zeus

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.940
and it was like honestly don't you go

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.500
south of Wilmington it gets so [ __ ]

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.479
hillbilly it was like a farm and it had

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.639
it was like a prison for dogs yeah was

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.440
wild it was an outdoor prison for dogs

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.600
everyone's on opiates too oh really the

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.100
whole state like Delaware City down

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.080
there dude Delaware in general people

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.360
are like that's where your boys from oh

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.020
big hunter

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.580
he's like anal [ __ ] time

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.500
he is an archetype of Delaware residents

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.539
yeah it really is has all the money in

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.319
the world and also shoots Coke and like

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.780
his neph and his niece yeah that might

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.539
just be it was his niece well Joe Biden

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.880
did in fact molest children yes you

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.440
can't say he sexually did but he

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.780
definitely bothered them he extremely he

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.780
bothered them to an extreme level

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.100
definition of molestation he's done that

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.680
yeah he bothered kids immensely which is

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.720
makes him a molester in the classical

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.940
definition there's a montage I've seen

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.860
it yeah he's literally molesting kids

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.560
but hunter Biden is like when I saw when

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.639
he came out on the news I was like I

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:27.780
went to high school with like 30 of

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.280
these dudes yeah yeah right like they

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.900
drove BMWs and like crashed them because

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.600
they were smoking cracks

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.919
but then in Delaware like it's weird the

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.419
way Delaware is laid out the private

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.720
schools are like so wealthy but then

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.100
those kids that go to private schools

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.840
will still hang out with like the worst

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.520
of juvenile delinquents that are like

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.860
like they somehow meet in Delaware

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.660
because they're so small there's Common

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.060
Ground so like I would go to parties in

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.740
high school and you would have like

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.840
like the Biden's kids would be there and

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.340
then there'd be kids that were like

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.319
smoking crack are you like the age of a

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:00.120
bud yeah there was abide in a year older

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.400

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.339
Hawk documentary

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:45.600
I still haven't worked on becoming Punk

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.120

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.759
ever what I was [ __ ] like an hour in

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:53.160

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.720
the [ __ ] other candy bar under the

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.450
bed I was like no

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.100
[Laughter]

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.480

out I came up to check on him he was

00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:22.199
awake so I asked him if he hid the other

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:24.059
mushroom bar she started [ __ ] with

00:17:24.059 --> 00:17:25.679
him we were just having a good time to

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:27.780

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.860
store because I was watching the Tony

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.539

00:17:30.539 --> 00:17:32.580
gonna go punk while he was on like just

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.780
something to do that's a nice move

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.100
because I'm turning 40. I gotta do

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.840

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.220
knowing what it was and nothing happened

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.260
really I'm just holding on to it what's

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.460
real is the dude that pitched the

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.039
no-hitter yeah that is right yeah that's

00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:19.500
very true there's a dude or Doc Holliday

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.039
yeah doc something he's a holiday for my

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:25.860
fights no he was like a met I think okay

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.539
but he thought he had the day off so he

00:30:27.539 --> 00:30:30.000
popped two tabs of acid oh [ __ ] showed

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.440
on the beach and they summoned them and

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.700
then they caught like no you got a game

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.140
today so he went and pitched a no-hitter

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.240
and like dude it wasn't as you would

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.799

00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:40.200
were nuts dude obviously he's on [ __ ]

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.880
ass but it was no hit one it was still

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.260
it was a no-hitter no hitter is like

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.120
really hard to do yeah it's [ __ ]

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.000
insane he did it though

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.179

00:30:55.559 --> 00:30:57.360
for like all day and it gives you like

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.519
slow release but let's get you geez what

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:01.140
happens is what happens is the boys

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.419
would pop them off their arms and nibble

00:31:03.419 --> 00:31:05.220
them so you cut a small hole and you

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.019
suck a little bit of that gel and it

00:31:07.019 --> 00:31:10.320
like [ __ ] you up big time Jesus but

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.760

00:32:09.179 --> 00:32:11.399
skin exposure is not expected to lead to

toxicity due to its extremely poor

00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:15.779
penetration of the Skin Barrier and

00:32:15.779 --> 00:32:17.519
symptoms of intoxication from skin

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:19.500
exposure are unlikely

have a theory they're all claiming

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.320
computer literacy and when no one's

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.880

all this [ __ ] they were going for it in

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.000
the [ __ ] 60s and 70s when they're

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.060
yeah with the Boomers the point like bro

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.680
they were stashing it's like the

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.240
difference between like dude I'm telling

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.520
you like the Tactical I'm telling you

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.760
when like our dads

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.579
or older only a fraction of them were

00:37:11.579 --> 00:37:13.920
pornhounds yeah I tried to say this I

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.079
got shut down on that no you met Tom's

00:37:16.079 --> 00:37:17.820
right we've talked about as many you had

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.640
like the op of getting porno in your

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.400
hands as a married man with children was

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.740
like top level [ __ ] you had to do

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.079
weird [ __ ] you had the first risk

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:30.780
pulling off 76 in the risque video which

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.040
you're gonna get hit by another car

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.320
which is now smoking and you had to go

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.599
you had to physically exist in a porn

00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:37.920
store for about 10 minutes you get to

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.180
hang out with a pedophile basically yeah

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.880
you had to exist in a porn store get out

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.040
of the porn store and nobody could see

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.020
you and then you had to get a box

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.180
somewhere in your house that's why when

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.820
they went they would get 50 [ __ ] mags

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.920
oh yeah yeah I mean they might have kept

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.480
them in their mechanic shop but still it

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.520
was like you might have caught a fap

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.980
like once a month yeah but the op wasn't

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.300
there it wasn't like your wife's like

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.280
hey I'm gonna go take a shower and

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.420
you're like I'm gonna look at the

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.280
hardest [ __ ] porn on the planet yeah

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.440
right yeah you see actually like and

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.700
then what's even nuttier than that was

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.640
like if you were a regular dude

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.320
you could go get like Playboy and

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.940
Penthouse but if you wanted to get like

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.980
something a little more like specific

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.960
yeah I found a velvet in the woods it

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.760
was very hardcore you had to send away

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.800
for that stuff oh like you would have to

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.380
like get a manila envelope sent to your

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.140
house

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.640

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.960
happened to me I did a clean out for

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.880

open and put it under the box ring and

00:38:43.619 --> 00:38:45.359
