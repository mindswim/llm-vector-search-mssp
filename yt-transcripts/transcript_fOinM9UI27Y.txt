i was excited for this episode for a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.320
multitude of reasons but i really

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.479

monday night actually it doesn't matter

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.560
if you're listening live itunes whenever

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.920
pull out a bottle of whiskey whatever

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.760
your favorite hard liquor is and the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.160
rules are very simple when bobby or alex

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.760
chimes in and tells us that we've said

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.400
something that you know something

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.280
yeah

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.720
that we normally do essentially some

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.480
hacky thing that we normally do on the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.560
show they're gonna call out drink and

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.480
tell us the reason why and we have to

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.760
drink and um yeah whoever dies first

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.360
that's when we end the podcast but we

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.800
have no idea what the rules might be so

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.720
we'll we'll just get into it hey you

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.239
guys heard any uh news on the

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.040
coronavirus

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.519
god damn it dave

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.780
let's start

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.210
[Laughter]

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.959
let me know about five minutes before

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.319
the last episode that we're playing

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.400

hammered on a drop of a dime like that

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.080
and so lewis goes dave just drink water

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.599
but you have to pretend like you're

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.680
drinking so it keeps the show going and

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.760
then at the end lewis gets hammered and

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.680
he goes dave's just been drinking water

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.760
the whole time

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.760
no wait he goes he goes dave's just been

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.840
drinking water the whole time is that a

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.000
drink [ __ ] you dave you have a kid and a

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.680
great white shark poster

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.640
yeah that's it's for the kid

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.080
it's actually not it's for a different

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.000
kid long story

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.840
what if i couldn't drink until i said

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.840
the wrong thing i'd just be hurling out

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.959
any obvious premise

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.080
oh man you guys are smoking inside you

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.560
[ __ ] rad you guys are so rad yeah

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.879
we're rad as [ __ ] dude

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.439
hell yeah i uh when when me and dave

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.879
live together we would smoke cigarettes

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.120
in time inside all the time so every

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.599
time i take a pull of this [ __ ] vape

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.439
i think about how much cooler i used to

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.519
be

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.439
i really yeah i've never smoked inside a

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.640
place

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.879
i've lived than ever but man

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.560
my parents did always growing up they

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.160
smoked you never did you never did

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.440
that's true as long as i've known you

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.479
you haven't

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.400
yeah i've never smoked indoors it's

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.199
pretty gross yeah the smell is rough

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.160
but it's like

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.440
you don't smell your own farts you know

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.639
what i'm saying you're sort of living in

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.040
it no i know and for sure but it's like

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.320
i think all you need to get away from it

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.919
for a little bit when you come back in

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:34.880
it's

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.040
pretty the car car gets the same way

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.720
i do smoke in the car so i have to spray

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.800
it constantly for that [ __ ] reason i

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.639
made out with a chick who

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.040
smokes recently

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.240
and uh

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.840
not good

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.639
yeah

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.280
not good this is disgusting

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.280
what'd you say enough to not go back to

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.520
the well oh i didn't give a [ __ ] i mean

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.440
that that wasn't the issue i you know it

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.560
just wasn't her well

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.560
she no she [ __ ] it just she had a

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.320
just the smell and the taste it's just

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.560
very like it really is like an ashtray

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.560
but hey you were paying for the hour

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.039
hell yeah it kept wonders all over it

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.320
when she was done blowing you yeah i um

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.360
i i smoked for so long and

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.960
i always said it was kind of hot when

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.080
chicks smoked it kind of sexy you know

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.680
and then recently that happened and i

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.880
guess it's been probably close to a

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.240
decade since i've smoked it i'm just

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.240
like no i can't go back to that

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.280
yeah

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.560
you're making out with a chicken like at

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.800
a bar like that's hammered with like a

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.479
you got like a dog mouth like it's like

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.320
a cold

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.199
it's like a cold dry mouth you're making

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.720
out with

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.400
usually cold and wet

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.960
same thing

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.880
you hit her in the face with newspaper

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.880
louis fired up baby hell yeah

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.479
what me joking about hitting women

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.039

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.400
yeah i can't believe well dave drank

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.639
anyway it didn't [ __ ] matter i just

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.639
assumed it was one of the rules

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.880
i'm only in the mail

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.440
i uh

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.039
ancestry.com i didn't have to it wasn't

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.039
court ordered but uh

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.240
bingo got us ancestry.com to do for fun

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.280
and uh

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.919
so i signed up online and then i read

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.400
the directions and it says yet you can't

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.440
uh drink eat or smoke for 30 minutes

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.960
before you do this and i go well that

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.560
means i have to do it first thing in the

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.639
morning because i'm not going [ __ ]

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.800
30 minutes and i tried to spit this

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.160
morning

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.039
and it took me almost 30 minutes just to

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:35.840
get

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.080
a small vial of spit out of my mouth

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.479
conjure up louis just wonder how many

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.240
times i've kissed a chick with that same

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.319
mouth

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.560
i don't like we we all did the ancestry

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.199
thing i i don't understand what the

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.120
appeal is even when you get the results

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.680
you're like okay so

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.800
but everyone was kind of what we

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.880
expected

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.759
also

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:02.479
very boring we're very boring dna tests

financial burden they came out of the

not a drink after it happens we're all

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.440
going to need a drink so i think we

00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:56.800

and to be honest with you it's a game of

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:01.760
numbers the more beautiful children i

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.279
put out in the world the more likely one

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:05.200
of my children are going to be molested

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.480
she's threatened to kill my dog

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.799
she [ __ ] she pretended to be pregnant

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.640
for five months after we did it it's

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.720
like i now that i've had it it's crazy

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.960
it's way too long to be pretending to be

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.080
pregnant louis lewis ended up abandoning

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.559
that dog and he would have abandoned

00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:01.440
that kid so it didn't really matter

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.520
wait wait you abandoned a dog

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.160
wanted an abandoned dog i gave the dog i

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.600
abandoned the dog as much as i abandoned

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.240
my son they're both with b

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.160
they're both with his son's mother yeah

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.679
so yeah i mean i guessed i abandoned

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.919
them both but they're in a better place

00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:20.000
like i said if they were dead as well

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.720
lewis sees that dog every other weekend

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.160
why did you hang in with yours for so

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.039
long

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:26.080
that check

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.640
yeah because

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.520
it's just about it being convenient and

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.280
it's just sort of like

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.880

she wouldn't she wouldn't leave

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.240
there's no walk in the park but she was

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.440
unstable

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.080
she was she was a scary chick she was

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.240
how did you break up with her

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.840
i ended up meeting another chick and i

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.120
liked the other chick so much that i

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.559
ended up just locking her out of my

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:37.559
apartment

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.600

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:43.919
out

00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:47.280

i mean her pretending that she was

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.600

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.039
me

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:12.240
in their defense you would have said

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.480
that no matter what i actually told you

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.200
you know

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.240
also what i was telling you was like

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.760
just find out you were just like living

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.919
life like it's not true so whatever i go

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:22.480
yeah but like make sure to find out

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.799
she was the type of chick

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:26.400
to make up the fact that she's pregnant

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.320
there's that type of chick i knew

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.919
there's no way i was like you have to go

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:31.440
back there and give her your hand do the

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.600
right thing marry her so that child is

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.679
not a bastard i was just like find out

00:20:35.679 --> 00:20:37.679
if she's not pregnant before you like

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:40.000
start some war with her here why when

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.200
here's what i found she wasn't pregnant

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.039
i called her

00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:45.039
house and her brother answered

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:46.720

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.200
i was like hey man like you know she's

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.400
you know she's telling me she's pregnant

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.520
i'm trying to do the right thing i just

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.600
want to and he's like nah man yo none of

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.039
my business you're at home i'm trying to

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:58.960
do the right thing and uh pay for the

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.520
abortion

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.039
and really i'm just trying to get her in

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:05.440
my presence so i could force a pregnancy

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.520
test upon her like i had a pregnancy

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.000
test in my back pocket at all times in

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.679
case i had to encounter her and i was

00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:12.960
like i was going to somehow get her to

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.080
take it

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.799
yeah

00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:15.919
by the way i don't know if you thought

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:17.440
that through you have to force her to

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.360
pee on a stick that's pretty difficult

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.600
for a woman to pee on a stick fire a

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.520
picture of beer at a bar and then just

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.680
hide it in the toilet

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.559
[Laughter]

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:30.000
the dog looks like he's from the matrix

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.760
right now

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.320
my uh my ex

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.480
i told me she was pregnant afterwards uh

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.640
by me and then i got a hold of her mom

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.320
and i was like no her mom hated me too

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.240
and she was like no she's not pregnant

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.320
but the girl i remember kurt saying that

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.320
that girl was dumb enough though that

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.000
i'd like prove it and she would like uh

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.159
like video chat me like holding a bag of

00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:53.600
sugar with googly eyes on it

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.640
love our child you have responsibilities

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:01.760
now as far as a lying pregnancy seems

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.120
psychotic

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.159
that's like something that's like should

00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:06.559
be you should be hospitalized for that

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:08.799
it's such a serious thing to fake now

00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:10.080
again you're thinking of a real

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.280
pregnancy that you need to be

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.360
hospitalized for

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.360
pregnancy you can do at home they don't

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.440
think it through it they just

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.440
they sort of go like all right well i i

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.960
don't want this to end right now

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.840
you're pulling out all the stops

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:34.390
[Laughter]

00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:40.000
if men were committing a crime like that

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.360
people would be like that's a that's a

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.960
serious thing but instead every dude's

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.440
like well you know women are crazy

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.520
yeah that's the end of it but what's the

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.600
uh what's the flip side of that for a

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.039
minute like calling a girl it breaks i

00:22:51.039 --> 00:22:54.280
have aids

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.880
yeah making aids do you stay with me for

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.760
a couple more bangs

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.720
i mean there is no equivalent for that

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.039
it's just it's it's a power play it's

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:10.799
just to control

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:12.559
that moment power play but it's a

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:15.039
[ __ ] huge but the the

00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:16.720
the proof you have to bring ahead on

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.400
that to keep that story going for you

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.480

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.120
sorry imagine having the power

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.120
to stay like at any time you had the

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.480
power to lie and stay in our

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.840
relationship

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.200
i've been in some relationships i didn't

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.679
want to end i would have hit the pitch

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:34.000
emotional and like

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.799
during a breakup

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:38.240
with my ex bro i'll pull the trigger on

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.880
some [ __ ] up texts and choices several

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.919
times

00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:44.000

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.919
but i never uh

00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:47.520
that one that dumb one was like the

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.320
worst because she like left me far after

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.000
i was thinking about leaving her and

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.760
then i didn't want her to leave me so

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.200
was that yeah we were willing to accept

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.559
anything

00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:57.760

i did two dives off a diving board in my

00:27:05.919 --> 00:27:07.840
life and then you realize anyone

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.279
watching a fat guy die with a diving

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:11.919
board man your body is doing just

00:27:11.919 --> 00:27:15.520
gravity defying activity

00:27:15.919 --> 00:27:16.880
it's just

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.799

00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:20.799
fat people diving

00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:22.559

in new york right now though there's a

00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:07.519
bunch of weapons placed all over the

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:08.840

like everything has to trickle down and

00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:40.000
now it's all out of whack so everyone's

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.600

don't even know what the meme was the

00:41:39.119 --> 00:41:40.640

swallowing

00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:43.520

stream during this

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.839

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.800
the rules are not paying as close

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.319
attention as we are i just hate to

00:42:40.319 --> 00:42:42.480
interrupt so often

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.920
we're not drinking every time we say

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.079

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:47.680
once once a rule has been broken the

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.800
rule has been broken that's when you

other day it was just sitting on my

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.640

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.839
somewhere

00:45:11.839 --> 00:45:14.079
that's the same age i was i was seven

00:45:14.079 --> 00:45:16.800
when i drank my uh my stepfather was a

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.000
big drinker and he had a glass of beer

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.319
and i thought it was apple juice oh i

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:25.680
took a huge swig and when i remember

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.839
oh i remember being a seven-year-old

00:45:27.839 --> 00:45:29.440
thinking you're getting apple juice

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.400
drinking beer and i freaked out like

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.200
you're like what the [ __ ] i mean it was

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.240
but and and that the beer tasted so

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.599
awful so god awful and i still

00:45:41.599 --> 00:45:43.680
when i drink beer to this day i can

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.760
taste that same taste

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.640

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.640
gold like it's just the greatest thing

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.200
ever but i remember at seven expecting

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.119
apple juice getting that i made it fit i

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:57.119
knocked the glass over i freaked out i

00:45:57.119 --> 00:45:59.040
think i fell on the floor it was it was

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.760
great

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.119
when i was probably at seven years old

00:46:03.119 --> 00:46:04.960
as well i stole one of my my grandma

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.839
rose used to drink beer which even like

00:46:07.839 --> 00:46:09.119
that i remember thinking it was weird

00:46:09.119 --> 00:46:10.720
that my great grandmother rose would

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.079
drink beers

00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:13.839
yeah but grandma drinking beer is

00:46:13.839 --> 00:46:15.760
garbage dude yeah it was just not very

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.640
ladylike but i mean now as an adult like

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.319
it's not weird that a chick drinks beer

00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:22.319
or that an older woman would drink beer

00:46:22.319 --> 00:46:23.839
but when i was a kid i remember just

00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:25.520

and me and my buddy angling arms and

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.079
[ __ ] like that

00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:36.160
what you said you have dangling arms and

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.560
just like drinking beers someone picked

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.079
wears the same dress every day but it's

00:46:40.079 --> 00:46:41.359
just like a zip up thing in the back

00:46:41.359 --> 00:46:43.760
that stretches yeah she wore one a house

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.359
coat that's what she would wear

00:46:45.359 --> 00:46:46.960
and uh this is the one that used to call

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.280
me the n word like every day she didn't

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.400
give a [ __ ]

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.720
and i stole our beer lewis that was just

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.400
the beer talking

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.599
and then

00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:57.680
me and this kid jr stewart we we just

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.359
took a sip each like we were out on the

00:46:59.359 --> 00:47:00.560
street which you can see beach and like

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.880
left it there and then i felt so guilty

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.560
that i went back and i told them that i

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.000
stole it

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.359
and uh

00:47:07.359 --> 00:47:08.720
oh

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.400
yeah my mom your grandma was right about

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.200
you yeah she [ __ ] me up i was not

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.280
stealing

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.359
dirty little thievin n word

00:47:17.359 --> 00:47:18.800
that's no good

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.760
yeah

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.440
that was my first time i tried

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.200
as a kid i didn't reinforce his

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.839
stereotype

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.960
wait is james allowed to say the n word

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.960
or do you admit that it is in fact a bad

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.720
word

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.079
i raised my kid like a [ __ ]

00:47:36.079 --> 00:47:37.280
liberal [ __ ]

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.960
james doesn't say the n word he just

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:43.359
says step dad yeah he said he's a sex

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.599
yeah he's allowed to say with a on the

00:47:45.599 --> 00:47:48.240
end because he stepped that game a pass

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.680
well it's a weird thing like i do have

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.440
that like debate in my head because we

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.960
do these shows and we say these crazy

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.200
things and do these dumb podcasts and

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.240
right and

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.240
and i'm like i am pretty extreme on the

00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.440
other round with my son like i don't let

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.680
him watch bad movies or say bad words

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.520
that he's never heard me say anything

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.400
like at all remotely racists or sexes or

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.920
any like literally not even slightly

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.760
like i'm such a [ __ ] [ __ ] when it

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.040
comes to that stuff like i really want i

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.800
want my kid to be a good kid and he

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.400
doesn't understand the context of jokes

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.920
so i just keep it pretty black and white

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.920
for him but he's just going to hear this

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.000
one day and i'm afraid that i'm training

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.800
him to eventually hate my guts

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.720
yeah for sure

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.800
do you think my kid's gonna like you

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.319
you're everything you taught me not to

00:48:28.319 --> 00:48:30.079
be yeah you're literally in a you're an

00:48:30.079 --> 00:48:31.920
embarrassment to be friends with i can't

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.280
even imagine you being my dad

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.480
yeah he's going to hate you he's going

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.880
to be a [ __ ] comedy blogger watch

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.760
maybe

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.800
this is going to be a parent teacher

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.480
conferences and accidentally bump

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.000
shoulders with another parent

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.680
and the guy just keeps walking vicky men

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.000
excuse me [ __ ]

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.640
that's the gymnasium of a pr of a school

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.720
no i don't think you should worry too

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.520
much about pissed

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.520
he's seven right yeah

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.720
yeah i don't know this isn't bad by not

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.240
my daughter we i asked this question

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.599
recently he said with all the friends

00:49:05.599 --> 00:49:07.040
cursing and [ __ ] was probably around

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.000
nine

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.440
where everyone just had a foul mouth

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.520
yeah all three of them have kids and no

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.839
dads

00:49:21.839 --> 00:49:23.040
now that is

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.720
when you put it like that it's pretty

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.720
accurate yeah they're all fathers

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.079
struggling with like substance abuse and

00:49:30.079 --> 00:49:32.079
being shitty i'm not struggling with

00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:33.599
substance abuse i'm [ __ ] owning that

00:49:33.599 --> 00:49:34.960
[ __ ] [ __ ] you're the only one that

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.319
actually is

00:49:36.319 --> 00:49:39.680
and you're the only one that denied it

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:43.010
were just like yeah

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:51.710
[Laughter]

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.079
a little bit at the end of the night big

00:49:54.079 --> 00:49:56.319
whoa

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.119
the same way like chicks without dads

00:49:59.119 --> 00:50:00.960
become kind of like [ __ ] or strippers

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.000
dudes without dabs become edgy

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:10.839
[Laughter]

00:50:10.839 --> 00:50:13.040
podcasters [ __ ]

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.599

you're making a [ __ ] crazy

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.040
his last laugh was like anaphylactic

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.280
shock

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.960
yeah just waiting for lewis to get back

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.640

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.680
uh whiskey cokes

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.960
changing the drink in the middle that

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.400
won't make you sick

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:10.079
no that's a [ __ ] myth

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.839
you're back

00:51:11.839 --> 00:51:13.599
when people say that because they drank

00:51:13.599 --> 00:51:15.119
too much and they kept switching up

00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:16.559
their drinks if you switch up your

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:18.160
drinks that much that means you drank

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.480
that many [ __ ] drinks

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.640
that's true one says oh i drank 17

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.400
[ __ ] roman

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.160
rum and coke so i'm fine because i

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.640
didn't switch to whiskey on the 17th

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.960
yeah there's a lot of myths also like

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.119
that [ __ ] the rum and coke [ __ ] where

00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:35.359
people are like oh [ __ ] rum

00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:37.119
gives me a [ __ ] hangover it's like

00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:38.640

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.559

higher up in the justice system and

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:56.720
they get into an uh a disagreement on a

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:59.440
jeffrey epstein yeah i argued with a

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.760
local cop for about two hours about

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:02.799
jeffrey f

00:57:02.799 --> 00:57:05.760
conspiracy theory [ __ ] and then the cop

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.160
came back over after he heard it on the

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.880
podcast to apologize

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.880

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:16.960
oh

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.799
as soon as the here's a guest here and i

00:57:18.799 --> 00:57:21.440
felt like a [ __ ] because i was like

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.359
you know i was i was a little drunk and

00:57:23.359 --> 00:57:25.119
i thought it was more heated than it was

00:57:25.119 --> 00:57:26.640
apparently

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.200
i was like

00:57:30.559 --> 00:57:32.160
he was talking about how he's throwing

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.440
pro-epstein

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.040
i was

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.440
[ __ ] we need to find fc's murderers

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.359
and this guy this guy was like i know

00:57:39.359 --> 00:57:41.200
he's your buddy i know you're a big fan

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.359
of jeffrey epstein and i was like yo

00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:44.290
that's not it bro

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:49.020
[Laughter]

00:57:49.359 --> 00:57:51.040
that's so funny it was a good move on

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.240
his part

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:55.119
i'll give him that

00:57:55.119 --> 00:57:57.040
defending that he was murdered jeffrey

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.799
epstein yeah he was like i know you care

00:57:58.799 --> 00:58:00.319
a lot about him and you want to find his

00:58:00.319 --> 00:58:04.680
murderers because he's your buddy

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.280
oh [ __ ] this works

00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.920
it was after 9 30 p.m so i was asleep

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.559
and missed it

00:58:16.799 --> 00:58:17.839
is that what time you crash out

00:58:17.839 --> 00:58:21.280
generally uh the the earlier

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.040
oh yeah and then he comes back and gets

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.119
another drink

00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:26.799
that makes sense more

00:58:26.799 --> 00:58:28.480
i can't go to bed i wish i could go to

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.160

oh jesus i just i i was

01:08:56.319 --> 01:08:58.640
because i'm associated with the

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.239
libertarian party

01:09:00.239 --> 01:09:02.400
because i

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.960
i fancied them 12 years ago dave's

[ __ ] series dirty money

01:09:12.239 --> 01:09:14.080
and then i'm like all right i'm taking

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.400
comedy notes like i've distanced myself

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.560
from the libertarian party i mean i

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.799
still have libertarian ideals when i can

01:09:20.799 --> 01:09:24.560
spot an ideal anywhere in my head

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.440

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.600

01:09:34.719 --> 01:09:37.359
would defend that [ __ ] guy so i can't

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:39.600
like all right if that's a party line

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.000
okay i'm out i'll go full [ __ ]

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.480
sanders or communist or hindu i don't

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.400
know the parties anymore i would say

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.600
being in a party does seem

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.440
counterintuitive to being a libertarian

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.239
right

01:09:50.239 --> 01:09:52.880
yeah i agree with that all of that

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.440
but that being said i've been made to

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.800
drink about 14 times already so i but it

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.560
sounds right libertarian oh that's right

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.640
that's a you know is libertarian really

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.640
a political like a drinking thing

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.640
because they're not really even

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.239
recognized as a [ __ ] party

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:11.199
dave

01:10:11.199 --> 01:10:13.760
dave i was big on rand paul or i mean uh

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:17.199
ron paul ron pauly

01:10:17.199 --> 01:10:18.480
i read his book he had like an

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.400
alphabetical book and a was like

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.679
abortion

01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:24.800
yes liberty defined yeah yeah are you

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.960
pro martin shkreli

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.400
me 100

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.560
what

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.600
no i'm joking

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.480
i'm i'm pro anyone who can get their

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.040
hands on wu tang's album and get it

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.520
distributed quicker no i'm not like pro

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.800
that guy but i don't know if he should

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:45.679
have gone to [ __ ] jail or not

01:10:45.679 --> 01:10:48.719
yeah that's uh yeah i'm heavily against

01:10:48.719 --> 01:10:51.040
jail for any reason it doesn't help

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.080
anybody in anywhere in society so that's

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.239
all it is it's not saying that he's a

01:10:56.239 --> 01:10:58.320
great dude or anything like that i don't

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.159
think he should be [ __ ] wrong

01:11:00.159 --> 01:11:02.800
they they put a person's face to

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.840
you know

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.679
i mean he loved being like smart now i'm

01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:08.719
going to get political yes

01:11:08.719 --> 01:11:10.560
release the kraken

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.719
he was like i don't know that much about

01:11:12.719 --> 01:11:14.080
him but from what i know he was kind of

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.320
a troll like he liked to be the [ __ ]

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.000
[ __ ] but i don't think that's enough

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.080
of a reason

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.159
it's bigger than him it's the fact that

01:11:22.159 --> 01:11:24.640
the [ __ ] like he was barely

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.840
a mention in that episode of dirty money

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:30.320
on netflix it's the fact that the

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:33.840
company realized oh we can jack up the

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.159
the prices of this

01:11:36.159 --> 01:11:39.120
medicine yeah but but why is that dug

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.120
because they [ __ ] own the patent to

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.640
it which is some [ __ ] government

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.520
[ __ ] program whatever i'd i'll drink

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.199
three more times for this but it's all

01:11:47.199 --> 01:11:49.280
[ __ ] government [ __ ]

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.280
in the long run it is but then you have

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.280
to change government while the ladies

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.600
dying the lady's [ __ ] dying right now

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.840
yes i agree so anything anything to get

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.640
that lady to not die is a good thing but

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.640
it's all because the government made the

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.880
rules that they own that drug that he

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.679
can jack those [ __ ] prices up i'm i'm

01:12:07.679 --> 01:12:09.040
against all that [ __ ] get rid of the

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.880
[ __ ] patent laws

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.600
i am not against what you're saying i

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:16.719
know the limitations of what my brain

01:12:16.719 --> 01:12:18.000
can

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.120
swallow

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.920
so yeah when i ran for president as a

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.239
joke and the libertarian party took it

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:26.719
seriously i tried to learn that stuff

01:12:26.719 --> 01:12:29.600
and i realized i can't learn that stuff

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.080
well that's that's where we're at you

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.000
were the most serious candidate we ever

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.760
had

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.199
he was the first intelligent candidate

01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:38.640
to be like actually i think i don't

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.120
understand this but doug was like this

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.400
will be hilarious and all the

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.400
libertarians were like we're in the game

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.760
finally

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.600
but i really thought i could learn i was

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:50.000
gonna just run as a joke and then what's

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.960
his uh as a minneapolis comic he's a big

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.840
libertarian guy and he's not well known

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.239
but he is to libertarians he talked me

01:12:58.239 --> 01:13:00.239
into running on their ticket and i

01:13:00.239 --> 01:13:02.320
thought well i could learn some [ __ ] no

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.520
can't

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.520
i have a ninth grade education and

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.440
there's a reason for that that's where i

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.280
topped out

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.960
wait did you drop out in ninth grade

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.360
after ninth grade [ __ ] yeah

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.440
did you have a ninth grade plus i had to

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.360
go to summer school to complete ninth

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.400
grade

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.640
did you finish it that's a tough yeah

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.080
that's how i get to 10th grade and

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.600
realize that i don't i don't want to do

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.040
something i'm learning about the rest of

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.560
my life

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.840
i wish i would have dropped out of high

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.679
school in the 10th grade when i was 16

01:13:29.679 --> 01:13:31.040
because i

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.480
what happened was the way it would work

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.400
is what i found out later is if you

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.679
dropped out of high school when you were

01:13:35.679 --> 01:13:38.239
16. yes i know sorry to interrupt but

01:13:38.239 --> 01:13:42.080
can someone iso that for his kid to hear

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.960
i wish i dropped out of to ninth grade

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.400
because you're worried about him saying

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.880
pissed and seeing

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.560
he's a good student

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.480
the reality is he's a good student right

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.800
so oh yeah and and he's studious and

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.880
he's like he's into learning right

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.880
shane he's close he not

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.239
york if you would have available out of

01:14:14.239 --> 01:14:15.920
high school and when you were 16 you

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.440
could have went to community college

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.800
start getting college credits and get

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.960
your ged at the same time so by the time

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.480
you're 18 you're in the same exact

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.520
position

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.960
than you would have been afterwards if

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.400
you're not like if you're not a good

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.400
student and you're not trying to go to a

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.159
good [ __ ] school

01:14:30.159 --> 01:14:31.840
then that would have been a better route

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.199
my daughter was a pretty good student

01:14:33.199 --> 01:14:34.560
and she's uh

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.080
getting ready for college but i don't

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.280
think she's going to start college in

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.719
the fall but everything's saying it

01:14:38.719 --> 01:14:40.880
doesn't make sense to start

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.480
right away right now

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.840
with no idea what's going on and they're

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.040
paying all that money and then [ __ ]

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.920

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.040
getting drunk and now we're in the

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.880
serious portion of the [ __ ] drink

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:55.990
yet

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:57.360
[Music]

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.719

01:14:58.719 --> 01:15:00.960

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.280
was scared to say that till i started

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.120
drinking

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.239
should i drink

01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:34.480
i've gotten those comparisons a lot

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.760
i thought i've toured with him for so

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.440
many years so

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.320
yeah and uh so much stuff and he can he

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.880
sounds like louis ck anyway when he did

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.880
his louis ck

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.320
impression

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.080
we were blown away and then he kept

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.840
talking and i go oh that's because you

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.920
sound like him anyway yeah he just has

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.320
to put a tiny bit of inflection on it

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.920
it's like correct gas can do same kind

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.520
of their voice tone so similar

i left and then they did it to be fair i

01:27:03.679 --> 01:27:06.000

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.239
distance from mcdonald's yeah everything

01:27:08.239 --> 01:27:10.719

01:27:16.159 --> 01:27:18.239
always

01:27:18.239 --> 01:27:20.239
time though it's like yeah yeah dude i'm

01:27:20.239 --> 01:27:21.600
20

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.880
here we are 20 minutes from my

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.520
mcdonald's

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.840
here's a hot tip

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:28.639
uh

01:27:28.639 --> 01:27:31.679
when you go shopping next time the only

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:34.800
fast food that can be reanimated by a

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:39.040
microwave they do sell white castle

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.520
cheeseburgers in the freezer section of

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.000
a safe layer whatever you have and they

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.560
taste exactly the same there are no

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.159
difference in quality one minute in the

01:27:48.159 --> 01:27:50.000
microwave you just open the little bag

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.600
you throw it in the microwave for one

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.639
minute

01:27:52.639 --> 01:27:54.719
so it's amazing and you're supposed to

01:27:54.719 --> 01:27:57.040
cook them in the bag somehow right yeah

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.120
because what makes it as sweaty as when

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:00.159
you get them through the [ __ ]

01:28:00.159 --> 01:28:01.360
drive-through

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.080
that's how bad white castle is is that

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.239
they're like these are best if cooked in

01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:08.880
plastic

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.159
delicious never looked like that

01:28:12.159 --> 01:28:13.520
back in the day what you would have to

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:14.800
do is you'd have to take a wet paper

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.800
towel you'd take a paper towel you'd wet

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.800
it and you wrap the burgers then you'd

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.880
microwave them but they did something to

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:23.040
it i have no idea what they did to the

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.480
burgers and the processing because it's

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.320
all processing now you just leave it in

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.600
the bag

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:28.960
you know what they do when you go to a

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.480
real white castle they pull out a box of

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.560
freezer white castle burgers and

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.480
microwave them for a minute and give

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.639
them to you and you go this is just as

01:28:38.639 --> 01:28:41.199
good as it is at home delicious i almost

01:28:41.199 --> 01:28:43.040
caught a mitch hedberg cadence there

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:44.880
maybe i'm getting drunk too but my bike

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.199

01:28:47.199 --> 01:28:49.679

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:20.800
from a pretty girl to make it palatable

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.800
and then you do a dd bow or a deer

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.719
hunter style russian roulette you pick

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.639

01:30:38.159 --> 01:30:39.280
squirt

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:42.159
the bottle into the person's mouth

01:30:42.159 --> 01:30:45.040
as a celebrity judge of sorts that's

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:45.840

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.040
i used to want to be a magician when i

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.199
was a kid when i was 11 years old i used

01:34:45.199 --> 01:34:47.920
to work at a hair salon called bruno's

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.480
and i was then again when he was 22 and

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.840
36

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:53.760
and i would sweep up all the hair on the

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:55.600
hair salon i would get all the girls

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.679
lunch it was my job to essentially

01:34:57.679 --> 01:34:58.800

club like an idiot

01:35:09.199 --> 01:35:11.600
like a [ __ ] baller the way every man

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:14.239
wants to die actually true actually if

01:35:14.239 --> 01:35:16.400
the kid that stabbed him wasn't 15 that

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:18.159
story was almost perfect and i didn't

01:35:18.159 --> 01:35:19.920
think if it was an adult that murdered

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.320
my father or not a child if my father

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.639
wasn't murdered by a [ __ ]

01:35:24.639 --> 01:35:25.840
a boy

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.920
that would be a badass story that's a

01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:31.600
child that bullies football players

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.600
my father was murdered by a goth

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.239

yeah it was

01:38:19.119 --> 01:38:21.440
it was a little bit there was no knives

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.800
involved but like i had to ask

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:27.040
like how much is that

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:29.600

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.400
sure i i don't know how much we got

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:33.760
wrong of the story we just read that he

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:35.840
murdered his mom and then we noticed

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:36.880
that he was like

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:39.440
like 30 shows and look i don't give a

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:42.159
[ __ ] [ __ ] his mom i'm on his side

01:38:42.159 --> 01:38:43.600
if you listen to the show dude i don't

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.760
give a [ __ ] about your mom dude

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:47.600
good for you

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.840
bro

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.520
it was one of those things where you go

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.360
hey this is my like

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.920
this is my kid you can't you say that to

01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:59.840
your friends but

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.760
you get the facts from i was yelling

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:04.159
back at the screen no that's not true

01:39:04.159 --> 01:39:06.480
yet like he's not free roaming what did

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.239
we get wrong though we said he was

01:39:08.239 --> 01:39:09.600
afraid

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.480
i think

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.520
i think you're saying that we thought he

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.199
was out

01:39:13.199 --> 01:39:14.639
that's what it was but i mean

01:39:14.639 --> 01:39:15.840
he had like uh

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:18.239
he had like work release he had a job

01:39:18.239 --> 01:39:20.880
and a bank account finally but he was

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:23.040
still like in the home and he was

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.600
fighting for i i know it was he was

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:28.800
fighting for like a complete uh

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:31.119
all right you can leave the facility and

01:39:31.119 --> 01:39:33.280
i'm like oh this is a bad time

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:35.199
because it's sisters you're gonna show

01:39:35.199 --> 01:39:37.520
up at the court hearing and people wait

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:41.119
do his sisters want him to stay in

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.840
he's seriously mentally ill he didn't

01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:56.320
kill his mother in a contentious way she

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:59.199
was the devil like yeah even like [ __ ]

01:39:59.199 --> 01:40:01.520
you i'm i i don't have to finish my

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.920
spinach right right now

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.280
it's not like that technically if he

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.119
believed she was the devil he did do the

01:40:07.119 --> 01:40:10.000
right thing true

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.280
basically you need st michael

01:40:14.639 --> 01:40:16.960
do you believe in god because if you if

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.480
you do

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.480
there's a bible you just swore on yeah

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:21.520
so did he

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.960
when you exercise a deal i don't know

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:24.960
whose joke it was but they said

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.560
you know what uh

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.480
you know the the sad thing the thing

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.080
about hitler is

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.080
now he's down in hell

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:36.000
surrounded by all those jews

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.800
it's technically accurate if you are a

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.719
believer in religion if you believe in

01:40:40.719 --> 01:40:43.119
the yeah i love those true technically

01:40:43.119 --> 01:40:45.280
if you are a christian i love those

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:47.760
those jokes you can make and go argue

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:48.840
with

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.840
it that'll blow mines up in brooklyn at

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.920
a bar show somewhere

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.119
what's that

01:40:55.119 --> 01:40:57.280
it seemed dark and it was funny

01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.320
well yeah

01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.360
dude

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.360
it's weird since they made you reboot

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.119
earlier yeah

01:41:03.119 --> 01:41:06.159
every time i talk over you i i can't

01:41:06.159 --> 01:41:07.920
it takes me yeah whenever somebody talks

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.840
over you it cuts you out yeah it's been

01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:13.760
a pretty big problem this whole podcast

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:16.800
yeah at one point you silently did an

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.320
act out with your like you rolled your

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:20.560
eyes like

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:22.239
it was the dead silence it was pretty

01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:24.400
