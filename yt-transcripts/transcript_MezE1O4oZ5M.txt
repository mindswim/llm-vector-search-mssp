that my levels are coming up yeah that

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.670
was weird it must have been I don't know

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.530
what happened so I I didn't know if that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.789
was I was watching everyone everything

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.379

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.199
knows who knows right now though we're

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.420
on an app I'm not saying we had a great

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.610
joke we had a great story about my mom

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.880
dumping the ceiling the whole dump thing

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.520
fine well anyway we're in the basement

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.430
where my mom took a [ __ ] upstairs and

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.570
clogged the toilet so hard that the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.580
ceiling in the basement collapsed which

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.990
is crazy which is one of the more

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.549
powerful don'ts about the roof down

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.470
that's like with Shaq brought the rim

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.060
down it had to be a toilet paper

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.229
incident hopefully because ladies had

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.090
doubled up on the team doing right they

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.850
got the front back with says I use way

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.229
too much toilet paper girls like her

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.049
learn how to take good clean dumps yeah

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.090
although I gotta be honest with you Joan

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.380
dropping the heat up they're bringing

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.009
the ceiling down I bet that was a that

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.229
sounds like a full release sweet treats

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.909
she might have been sneaking sweet

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.040
treats it had resulted in a catastrophic

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.680
dump dude I told you I said Hindenburg

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.909
of dumps I've talked about this before

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.049
my my cousin one time made me like go

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.119
real hard and never flushed it it was

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.180
like a long thick yeah yeah we used to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.260
play a game where like it was called

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.980
sniff the John

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.659
like I'd take a dump and you'd have to

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.060
go face as close you get to the turd and

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.620
it smell as much as you could whoever

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.090
like didn't you ever could smell the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.650
most they were talking about stacked him

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.040
Brian

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.110
yeah just if that John was like if you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.519
get reasonable it was sniff to John and

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.540
then there was like we would make each

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.250
other eggs and like you'd put in as many

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.840
different weird spices as possible

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.069
whoever could eat it with like you know

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.590
that was a win so he went up the one

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.519
time it was you like combine those games

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.470
no no I mean after you eat the egg sniff

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.060
the turd someone's gonna smell that turn

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.220

game I could never do I could never

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.799
watch someone that close don't get that

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.599
cuz you would feel the turn to hit your

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.459
face which would be so funny that would

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:22.530

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.069
the bubbles of gasping for air turd

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.419
might sneak in there no the feeling of

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.620
like breathing underwater in a pool

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.419
imagine knowing the feeling of breathing

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.970

00:15:14.779 --> 00:15:16.519
canister shot is what it's called and

00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:17.720
when they get within like three

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.209
what was the objective the civil war was

00:15:20.209 --> 00:15:22.040
a South trying to get up to like the

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.779

[ __ ] walk around this [ __ ] I try to

00:15:33.319 --> 00:15:35.920
come from the other side

00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:40.009
all right to destroy each other's army

00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:42.110
okay so the only way that gets done they

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.660
were specific no no no Senate break this

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.550
well there were a couple times they were

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.410
like we were gonna try so they were

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.959
gonna try to get the army out of DC yeah

00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:53.629
try to lure the Army of the Potomac out

00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:56.060
of DC so they could take it but they

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.079
were never gonna be able to take these

00:15:57.079 --> 00:16:00.019
they were laying at that the the South

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:01.550
was winning every battle up until

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.500
Gettysburg yeah it's kind of like a war

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.879
of attrition where the north was getting

00:16:04.879 --> 00:16:05.569
tired of it

00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:06.920
the people in the north were like we

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.600
gotta stop this we just keep getting our

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.430
[ __ ] dicks knocked in so they were

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.040
losing the north was losing bad what sad

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.199
until Gettysburg that was a turning

00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:16.399
point I was the turning point than we

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:17.930
were standing at the turning point where

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.399
we losing the turning point of the

00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:21.139
turning point which was pretty sick yeah

00:16:21.139 --> 00:16:24.620
at the end of at Little Round Top how

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.779
the [ __ ] were you losing we were losing

00:16:26.779 --> 00:16:29.959
because the North had a lot of inept

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:33.459
generals that were like they wasn't

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:38.439
drunk he was a drunk and he was the best

00:16:38.439 --> 00:16:40.759
our best guy cuz he was like [ __ ] it

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:42.319
we'll just throw people at we have more

00:16:42.319 --> 00:16:44.180
people than them yeah so every battle we

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.069
can just [ __ ] we can go person for

00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:48.019
person and we'll end this thing in a war

00:16:48.019 --> 00:16:49.610
of attrition whose dude who's like we

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.199
just got to keep training where is train

00:16:51.199 --> 00:16:53.870
wellin okay they all love them all the

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.300
soldiers love them right somehow yeah he

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.680
never fought he was always afraid to

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.600
fight he was a big trainer he just had

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.579
his boys training non-stop he always

00:17:01.579 --> 00:17:03.379
overestimated whatever the South had

00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:06.289
like no matter what sure and Lee general

00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:07.760
they had lead the whole time he was good

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.860
he was a beast yeah he was Bill

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.439
Belichick he was the coach did he was a

00:17:12.439 --> 00:17:13.880
genius he was [ __ ] everybody up but

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.740
at Gettysburg so like you said like why

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.199
don't they walk around every battle was

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:20.480
defensive yeah most point for the south

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.159
usually the South would get somewhere

00:17:22.159 --> 00:17:23.870
set up shop and the north would come to

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.850
that okay and so they would just be

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:26.990
dominating so they would just come up

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.419
and be like wearing your state yeah

00:17:28.419 --> 00:17:31.660
about it like you better get out

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.210
what are you gonna do about these there

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:39.790
they have banners like we love slave no

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.380
they went the route of like they would

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.810
never mention slavery yeah ever they

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.460
never were like hell yeah slavery so

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.190
they were like this is about states

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:52.120
rights yeah death to tyrants yeah cuz

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.620
they're being because they were like the

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.970
federal government was telling the state

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.560
what to do yeah which back then wasn't

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.140
happening so that that was a the federal

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.670
government won that one the federal

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:01.720
government was like yo you guys better

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.050
[ __ ] listen damn they do and now they

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.300
listen yeah they've won that one yeah

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.650
the federal government won we were the

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.810
Federals say were the Confederates they

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.570
were anti federal the Confederates so

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.890
they're basically like you can't tell us

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.780
the federal government has no say in the

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:25.030
states rights yeah we'll kill you guys

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.990
yeah the North was hesitant I think the

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.870
South was the one who seceded it was

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.250
they did they wanted the they were like

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.020
and then the Union was like you can't

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.760
leave we can't split this country in

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.850
half yeah you guys are staying we're

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:47.140
leaving it like you're [ __ ] slavery

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.550
thing it what was it as much as slavery

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.770
or nah yeah it was about slavery so the

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.900
South trust act like it wasn't yeah like

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.430
it's about states rights about states

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.090
rights to slaves and people from the

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.650
South always be like the North was just

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.870
trying to like [ __ ] the South's

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.180
economy by taking away slavery it's like

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.380
why would they they're in the same

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.000
country they're not trying to do that

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.550
yeah so that's contradictory to a lot of

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.530
the stuff too and they're like slaves

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:12.700
weren't even that big of a deal anyway

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.870
and people didn't even really have them

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.580
they didn't uh it'd be like people

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.320
didn't have them yeah people don't have

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.180
them you had them didn't have you

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.500
probably know yo Elon Musk Oh connie's

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.780
plays what I was gonna say yeah um US

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:33.340
was in South Africa oh he's like a

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.230
billionaire South African oh that's some

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.850
blood diamonds yeah

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.929
he was a boat not a huge fan of the yeah

00:19:40.929 --> 00:19:44.730
he met his family a master fortune I

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.809
don't know I don't I don't know if he

00:19:46.809 --> 00:19:48.490
was that rich working so hard to build

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.230
robots he's like well we can't have

00:19:50.230 --> 00:20:05.139
sleep just programmed its voice that's

00:20:05.139 --> 00:20:09.129
something we're working on robots talk I

00:20:09.129 --> 00:20:14.919
was because he is from my own super

00:20:14.919 --> 00:20:16.899
wealthy family right I don't know he has

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:17.919
to I don't think you become like a

00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:20.139
self-made billionaire yeah you don't

00:20:20.139 --> 00:20:21.970
you'll just be like I'll build a [ __ ]

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.009
rocket yeah I know he was like bullied

00:20:24.009 --> 00:20:26.769
real bad beating the [ __ ] out of him a

00:20:26.769 --> 00:20:32.350
lot yeah yeah and he started like Pepa

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.700
so he was in South Africa when he was

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.029
young

00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:42.220
oh yeah he might've been he built a

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.490
chappie he's trying to build a Japanese

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:56.919
making fun of me brew all right so your

00:20:56.919 --> 00:20:58.779
point was why don't they just [ __ ] go

00:20:58.779 --> 00:21:01.210
around them yeah yeah so that was what

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.679
happened so the South was usually

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.720
fighting a defensive war okay then they

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.279
got to Gettysburg that was the only time

00:21:06.279 --> 00:21:07.870
they invaded the north that was the only

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.399
time they ever even got into the north

00:21:09.399 --> 00:21:11.289
so they were feeling her up they were

00:21:11.289 --> 00:21:13.629
feeling good they were under here

00:21:13.629 --> 00:21:15.429
they're [ __ ] us up pretty much

00:21:15.429 --> 00:21:17.830
everywhere [ __ ] and then how they must

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:29.289
been so annoying like but yeah then Lee

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:33.490
so his his right-hand man Stonewall

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.440
Jackson got called [ __ ] friendly fire

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.179
but do you imagine killing the general

00:21:37.179 --> 00:21:38.470
of that would be the guy who [ __ ]

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.570
nails and all like that's a big win yeah

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.639
I got a guy I shot him off a horse yeah

00:21:42.639 --> 00:21:44.559
it's like kind of smoky yeah like yes

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:47.889
nailed among people you hit someone is

00:21:47.889 --> 00:21:49.330
so satisfying

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.340
general they're like well their generals

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.430

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.470
you on your own team you shot your own

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:00.250
Jeff oh yeah his own guy his own guy

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.350
shot friendly five yeah he was evil it

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.360
was kind of a double agency no it was

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.100
kind of a dumb [ __ ] move I think he

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.770
was doing like a big kill that guy I

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.210
don't think I think everyone was like

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.100
you're gonna have to live with that one

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.300

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:21.850
enemy lines

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.370
he it was kind of [ __ ] dumb yeah and

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.440
who Stonewall Stonewall Jackson was kind

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.880

knock it off shout stop that's what

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:48.360
happened Stonewall Jackson was rock hard

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.040
rock hard out there so he got shot

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.810
accidentally he got shot accident it was

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.400
friendly fire that killed him how though

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.650
it was nighttime he's riding up on a

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.150
[ __ ] guard post

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.040
he's probably come home [ __ ] riding a

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.570
horse yeah and someone was just doing

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.670
their job yes I was just being a guard

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.800
from the south so I'm [ __ ] [ __ ] from

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.900
Virginia was just standing there who

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.560

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.080
soldiering yes the outfits were the same

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.300
right except for the color the outfits

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.070
you the outfits looked exactly like you

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.630
know on all the statues it's like I

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.880
can't yeah yeah it's all bronze yeah I

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.260
always walk around looking to see what

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.640
statue I'm taking down I'm like is that

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.650
a [ __ ] great blue they freed slaves

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.570
they abolished slavery by you know

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:38.710
risking their own lives

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:43.390
yeah so that's kind of honorable yeah so

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.030
anyway so that's why they were a little

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.860
confident this was their first invasion

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.690
into the north and they they the north

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.850
set up a defensive position yeah along

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.170
this Ridge they were in like the shape

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:59.320
of a J nice all right so there's

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.390
anything like a fishhook like a J on

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:02.590
this like Ridge

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.179
and the South was coming in trying to

00:24:04.179 --> 00:24:07.330
attack and Longstreet his new right-hand

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:10.059
man was like dude we're killing him all

00:24:10.059 --> 00:24:11.379
we have to do is be defensive let's

00:24:11.379 --> 00:24:13.090
retreat and set up on like a mountain

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.009
and you want to come [ __ ] get us and

00:24:15.009 --> 00:24:16.899
Lee was feeling himself and was like we

00:24:16.899 --> 00:24:18.730
can do it this will be the disillusion

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.659
turning them up and yeah come ride how

00:24:22.659 --> 00:24:25.240
many fell ah man you're talking probably

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.730
20,000 people to you in three days

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.830
damn you're missing my favorite part of

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.029
the story which is uh

00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:35.409
when Warren goes up Oh Warren goes to

00:24:35.409 --> 00:24:37.840
check out Little Round Top and big round

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.940
times oh he's okay I'm gonna see where

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.220
our forces are looking like okay so to

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.679
set this up the J yeah at the bottom of

00:24:44.679 --> 00:24:46.899
the J so if the J was upright it'd be

00:24:46.899 --> 00:24:48.700
the so the fishhook at the top of the

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.379
fishhook not the point

00:24:50.379 --> 00:24:54.009
gotcha that's the left flank okay and

00:24:54.009 --> 00:24:57.190
it's it's unguarded it's the top of a

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.669
mountain like a very small hill sure and

00:24:59.669 --> 00:25:01.869

general Warren to go check it out and he

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:05.499
gets up to the top and like the whole

00:25:05.499 --> 00:25:10.749
southern armies on the other side he had

00:25:10.749 --> 00:25:12.279

walking up the hill like holy [ __ ] oh

00:25:21.759 --> 00:25:22.899
yeah they were like they were like

00:25:22.899 --> 00:25:24.970

dudes up the other side of the mountain

00:25:37.899 --> 00:25:39.820
and just we're standing up there waiting

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.470

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:11.530
I even remember as a kid being like yeah

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.330

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:14.620

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.060
was a young kid out of West Point

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.130

00:28:31.929 --> 00:28:34.419
pushed north [ __ ] awesome really yeah

00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:35.409
you can see it because they broke

00:28:35.409 --> 00:28:37.419
through the line right there and there's

00:28:37.419 --> 00:28:38.980
like a monument right there where it's

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.419

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.419
there's this monument to this dude who

00:28:52.419 --> 00:28:54.309
was like holding the artillery so they

00:28:54.309 --> 00:28:55.840
had artillery set out and there was an

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.610
hour-and-a-half bombardment from the

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.460
south to like loosen up the lines before

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.620
they charged Pickett's Charge yeah yeah

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.720
and this guy started with like six

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.309
batteries he was down to one cannon

00:29:06.309 --> 00:29:08.289
everybody got killed he got shot like in

00:29:08.289 --> 00:29:10.269

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:16.750
charging he was getting held up by

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:19.210
another officer and he was like leaning

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.100
on a cannon and fired one more canister

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.169
shot and then took a bullet in the mouth

00:29:23.169 --> 00:29:26.950
oh that's how he died Malvo can I jump

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.870

stomach pain armpit and groin shot fight

00:29:37.809 --> 00:29:39.250
I love that he fired one more shot

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.960
though funny even gets a cannon just

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:50.679
like [ __ ] stood was like he looked

00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:53.159
like a woman but I've never seen a finer

00:29:53.159 --> 00:29:56.080

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.730
talking about West Point hazing then

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:14.230
straight to this how many boys do you

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.029

are getting raped it's probably a lot

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.120
because drummer boy is getting passed

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:30.340

talk about yeah no they don't they don't

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.100
I bet I bet there you can find himself

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.320
about drummer boys getting it I mean if

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.670
it chick walked around the battlefield

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.320

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.960
about how like tough those dudes must

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.810
have been those are the toughest races

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:06.370
ever tough dudes yeah you're in full

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:07.750
cotton yeah

it was like 90 degrees out 20 95 degrees

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.360

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.160
there's no water no yeah no one knows

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.250

so you get water every like two days

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.840
thank God they have like a pinch of

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.610
whiskey and they're just standing there

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:34.170
in the heat drinking whiskey like

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.060

Stewart just like jeb stuart he was the

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.720
southern he was like the cavalry from

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.850

a [ __ ] up head like a new boss but

00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:57.270
they just kept on them

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:03.610
I think you just kind of like acorns I

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:06.460
thought [ __ ] that's what I heard yeah

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:06.970
yeah

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.580
why don't plug it no no no cuz it's like

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.530
you can't use leaves because you might

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:15.790
get like you know some type of thing you

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:17.080

the smoothie dumpster they're fine no

half taking dumps back then I bet

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.990
dump you don't gotta wipe your ass that

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:30.880
much you know like a dog doesn't have to

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.020
wipe his ass I think as they were

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.340
probably squatting if you're squatting

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.090
in the woods

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.099

successful bayonet charge yet if you're

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:14.240
a bayonet charge it is a desperate move

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.560
things aren't looking good I think you

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:20.730
agree with that Gurley those guys looked

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:22.050
once they realized the bayonet charge

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:28.980
into work but then this was it this was

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.510
the most successful the boys from

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:32.280
Rochester charged down that Hill give

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.710

little late the kickoff started I didn't

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:42.090
get it quite finished but the Irish are

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:43.740
looking good so far though so far yeah

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:45.540
they go down about the 8 yard line when

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:49.980
I was forced to pause the video so here

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:52.980
I am we're gonna wrap this up real soon

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:55.890
oh here we go here's a good question how

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:57.480
do you think your your presidents doing

00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.560
what type of job do you think the

00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.820
president United States is doing right

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:00.150
now

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:03.720
I think he's doing an excellent job and

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.910
I would be surprised if anyone differed

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:07.400
with that viewpoint

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.530
he is doing things that other presidents

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:12.360
that didn't have the nuts to do he is

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:16.190
doing ok it's not always popular with

00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:19.550
most of the people in the United States

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:24.080
why do you talk exactly like him

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.970
have you ever caught Shane like

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:33.350
companies pillows or anything like that

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.600
we specifically told those questions

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.940
were not gonna be as so I remember the

00:52:44.940 --> 00:53:10.530
price drop in big loads and what are you

00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:13.620
saying they're quite certain all right

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.330
you want to talk about your [ __ ] hole

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.280
into the money you picked up some talk

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.870
about your [ __ ] jeans at the laser tag

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.980
you remember that when we took the kids

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.850
to play like that was I have to explain

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:35.570
I had prostate surgery called

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:45.240
incontinence I just can't control you

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.250
know but the start didn't stop and when

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:49.980
you have to urinate that's all so I back

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.510
to back the president Trump just

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:53.670
happened to be a very sensitive strobe

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:56.420

picked up pee stains they were I'd be

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.260
I'd be more of an odd attack they would

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.850
get me in a lot of dotted pee stains

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:15.690

acts on social media and is texting and

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:43.200

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:55.470
would you lay your life down for Trump

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:56.910
if there was a shooter between you and

00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:58.290
Trump would you jump in front of a

00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:00.960
bullet for the president yes I would you

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.160
would die for President Trump

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:06.330
I would die for any president even Obama

00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:07.560
even though but what does that even

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.990

didn't like those guys but I would do it

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:13.410
for the country even Clinton after what

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.120
