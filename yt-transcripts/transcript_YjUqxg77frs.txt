yeah this is the oh my god this is the

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.380
let's say the salvaged wreckage of the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.740
myth episode I attempted to do realized

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.609
it was a [ __ ] bad idea about 30

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.460
minutes into it and again this wasn't

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.760
because of the the guy I did it with is

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.550
a of course patreon benefactor and he

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.579
has like a background in neuroscience

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.149
psychology or psychiatry I think and we

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.660
got to talking about you know all my

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.239
mushroom stuff come easily he knows a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.430
lot of the brain science associated with

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.579
you know therapy and all that stuff I'm

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.239
more of a I don't know dare I say

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.070
visionary I don't know I I'm not even

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.090
I'm not gonna look I'm not gonna sit

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.210
here and Stroke myself off over my

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.040
laptop microphone I'm just not I'm not

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.939
that guy but um yeah so I started

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.970
reading I started reading this guy

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.670
mythology which was a bad [ __ ] idea

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.659
because a the the myths or a I don't

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.159
know [ __ ] dick about mythology

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.560
basically the I just realized that it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.030
took me 30 minutes of talking to a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.619
stranger about mythology that I don't

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.380
know [ __ ] [ __ ] about it like he would

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.880
ask me certain questions ago so when do

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.829
you think that was around like the what

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.659
was that like the medieval I'm like uh I

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.320
think like the 12th or 11th century when

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.360
was the Bronze Age it was just like I

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.939
just realized I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] while

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.780
doing that it was like [ __ ] so and and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.670
you know which would be funny but it was

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.820
just like thirty minutes of just me

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.090
trying to read this stupid Irish

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.040
folklore to this guy which in Irish

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.000
folklore and Celtic mythology is like

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.660
there's no you know there's no like deep

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.580
at least from what I've read and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.470
listened to inaudible there's

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.850
like deep like like there's like

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.640
narcissus who like in Greek mythology

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.140
who like falls in love with his own

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.050
reflection and drowns and all this stuff

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.580
Celtic mythology is based off of like

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.500
literally there's like three or four

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.650
different kinds of like stories the one

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.510
is called a wooing which is just guys

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.380
get how guys got [ __ ] the other is just

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.370
like cattle raids like how dude stole

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.930
other dudes cows and the other ones are

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.850
just battles so it's like I mean it's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.820
pretty tight you know some on that level

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.320
it's just it was just stupid I was

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.760
reading it at [ __ ] sucked

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.620
I was just it was just me trying to be a

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.750
smarty pants the whole time and just

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.520
realizing while doing that like a

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.200
dual-process thing where one part of me

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.670
was being a smarty pants the other part

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.900
was like Jesus Christ who you are

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.980
[ __ ] dumb so yeah so I spared you

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.209
guys from a half an hour of just

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.020
absolute unlistenable garbage and

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.350
cutting to the point where thank god a

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.490
gracious benefactor he he just like kind

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.110
of started talking kind of broke the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.110
mold which again it was good to have it

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.550
was nice that I tried the mythology

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.320
podcasts cuz I did want to do something

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.440
but it ended up like you know him just

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.000
teaching me a bunch of [ __ ] about the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.209
brain and just about how uncertain

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.800
psychiatry is how people you know tend

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.910
it I thought I've talked about this

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.560
before the SSRI business and how

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.380
everyone kind of thinks that's like you

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.910
know what would a doctor psychiatrist

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.410
tells in the Z honest-to-god truth and

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.180
you know blah blah so we talked about

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.790
you know psychedelics and how that

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.500
pertains all that business it was pretty

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.840
cool it's about an hour so that's it

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.459
enjoy it or don't smoke anything

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.100
apparently they did and these ones the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.810
only thing that it was recorded that

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.900
they did was mistletoe which apparently

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.090
is like pretty disappointing for anyone

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:18.390
who's ever tried yeah mistletoe [ __ ]

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.549
you up but it's like yeah apparently it

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:21.870
has some sort of property I've never

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.010
done it me either

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.289
but I've read about people who've done

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.030
in they said like yeah this sucks

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.040
so again though they didn't write much

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.350
down there's a huge chance that like all

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.640
the stuff they were taking got

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.790
completely just nobody knows because

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.200
there's a ton of the stuff that was lost

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.060
but again they also could have just been

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.210
doing tons of mistletoe idea that like a

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.600
lot of these kind of like religious or

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.120
you know mache men traditions were

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.540
inspired by discovery of hallucinogens

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.550
because you'd imagine your walk you're

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.660
doing you know you're going about your

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.480
daily life and that you you take you eat

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.890
a route and you start tripping balls

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.270
yeah that would be the most profound

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.280
experience for anyone in that village oh

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.020
for sure when you know the framework of

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.730
what it is you definitely got possessed

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.380
by like a ghost or a spirit for sure

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.480
there's no way that someone to do that

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.820
and be like I must have over activated

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.560
my like GABA sensors they were they hit

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.690
that thing and like leaves to eat those

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.270
things and see demons and like they were

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.890
like oh you eat this and you see demons

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.919
you're like whoa [ __ ] that's crazy

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.840
yeah so yeah I definitely agree but yeah

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.130
I looked into it and apparently it's

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.630
like the only thing is pops it's popped

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.669
up in the written history is mistletoe

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.640
so but there's also there's like [ __ ]

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.140
hundreds of thousands of you know

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.530
different plants and compounds even this

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.450
is even going back like they talked

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.870
about the white hazel yeah they're

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.400
talking about like witch witch hazel

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.620
which is you know like an astringent

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.090
like it's a a certain indigenous

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.700
medicine in North America as well used

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.919
it to treat like psoriasis all sorts of

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.419
[ __ ] that yeah like I I'm I'm super

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.190
fascinated by that like you you don't

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.350
like you said like you have no frame of

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.520
reference if you're you know for example

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.040
you know in the Middle East and you have

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.380
you have a [ __ ] you trip balls the

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.210
idea that you were born to a virgin is

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.820
not much of a stretch no you were seeing

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.310
[ __ ] like you're like seeing genies

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.460
in real life and you're like [ __ ] yeah

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.349
yeah man it's definitely bizarre to

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:38.880
think about those guys finding that

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.230
stuff

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.670
and is completely having no frame of

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.990
reference although I mean it would just

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.190
you would only thing you could do is

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.650
take it literally back then because even

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.240
to be like this is a hallucination was

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.630
like not even a concept and people who

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.970
people who buy into that now

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.840
like sure we can you know we can BS and

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.400
pretend that we understand the kind of

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.890
pharmacokinetics and stuff but it's the

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.140
same concept like let's say you know

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.210
you're drug addicted you're smoking

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.840
cigarettes and you have this this you

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.440
know profound [ __ ] experience on a

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.740
drug like ketamine or or mushrooms and

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.080
of course you can you can make a

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.260
dramatic change like it's such a it's

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.960
such a life-changing experience

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.120
ya know definitely it definitely does

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.680
and even if even if you have the whole

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.180
like scientific understanding it's so

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.070
profound that you'll literally be like

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.020
well yeah I don't know about some of

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:39.670
that now yeah it's important to maintain

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.880
skepticism especially when it comes to

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.340
psychoactives and that cut like it for

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.110
me so you like again and kind of

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.770
day-to-day [ __ ] you could see a

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.500
depressed patient mm-hm and you give

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.850
them you know sip relax would say the

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:03.280
majority of the therapeutic benefit is

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.400
placebo like really the yep when you do

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.560
so there's been there's been large meta

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.580
analyses looking at you know the various

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.560
antidepressants now yes is that SSRIs

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.130
are super safe sure and overdose so

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.200
they're kind of first-line but they suck

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.230
they're they're they're marginally

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.570
better than placebo nobody wants to hear

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.300
that I've read there was that one doctor

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.690
who did a lot of research on there's one

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.250
in particular who started I think the

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.099
original meta analyses on all that and

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.840
yeah man and like people get mad when

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.760
you're like hey like if you're looking

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.290
and they're like no that people tell me

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:44.750
that can't be true I'm like that is

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.240
that's literally blaspheming your

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.680
blasphemy against the Druids

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.750
exactly like that

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.670
it's your like the placebo is so

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.470
powerful and it's it's what you have to

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.240
work with that you know you're

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.160
undermining you're undermining that

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.220
mythology but that's why I'm very open

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.459
minded and like I think you know in like

00:09:04.459 --> 00:09:07.819
your your journaling and [ __ ] like you

00:09:07.819 --> 00:09:10.459
pointed out you know being open-minded

00:09:10.459 --> 00:09:12.439
to some of these alternative therapies

00:09:12.439 --> 00:09:15.500
because our first lines suck balls they

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.779
don't they don't work effectively yeah

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:20.209
this isn't like treating like treating

00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:23.779
diabetes and like treating you know high

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:25.730
lipids or anything like this we do not

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.759
have medications that work well for sure

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:32.420
so we we need to reach out and you know

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.279
try things because you know our current

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:40.370
toolset is and isn't working yeah I've

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.759
read that like the so they have people

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:45.470
some people they say suffer from like

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.970
and from what I've heard it's a very

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.949
like small percentage but like suffer

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:51.019
from like real biological depression

00:09:51.019 --> 00:09:52.430
where it's just like no matter what

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.160
there's no stimuli there's no like

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.269
neurotic thought pattern they're holding

00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:57.709
on to it's just like that's the

00:09:57.709 --> 00:09:59.509
functionality of their brain but it's

00:09:59.509 --> 00:10:02.269
also the fact that so many people I

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:04.309
guess you might not that might not be

00:10:04.309 --> 00:10:05.899
the case they're so quick now because

00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:07.459
that's our current mythology that like

00:10:07.459 --> 00:10:09.829
our brains are just these series of

00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:11.750
chemicals and firing that we totally

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.759
understand and if you take this pill a

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:15.860
boost your you know your SS or your

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.860
serotonin or it inhibits the reuptake of

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.139
your serotonin now you're happy that's

00:10:21.139 --> 00:10:22.240
where happiness and contentment

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.290
contentedness comes from it's like yeah

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.399
that's some telling you I think that's

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:29.990
really if anything it's just like that's

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.490
our mistletoe right now or it's just

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.649
kind of like oh yeah dude as people get

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:35.509
[ __ ] mad I'm like dude read like

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:38.420
there's the book um [ __ ] lost

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.040
connections or something that's Johann

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.990
Hari he wrote a book where he just goes

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.360
about the SSRI theory and shows like you

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.759
know how unstable how it doesn't it's

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:48.680
not as like sure fires everyone thinks

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.449
and I told people about that I guess -

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:51.529
who are on them and they're just like

00:10:51.529 --> 00:10:53.360
this [ __ ] like what get the [ __ ] out

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.970
of here and it's like alright sorry but

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.589
your child you're challenging their

00:10:57.589 --> 00:10:59.600
religion exactly they believe in that

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.490
exactly that's I said it's it's the

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.870
[ __ ] Eucharist of scientific

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.920
materialism that's

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.230
like SSRIs or just like do you believe

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.190
that your brain is purely you know

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.079
chemical - exactly you're like yes give

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:15.440
it to me yes I mean they do have

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.950
evidence and for some folks they do they

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.019
do work well but I mean like even like I

00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:22.490
said this mostly it was a GMO a big

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.389
study the most effective was an

00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:28.430
old-school [ __ ] medication called

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.810
amitriptyline or elavil which is a dirty

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.560
drug and it's you know you can overdose

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.459
but you know all these newfangled

00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:39.589
medications you know they aren't super

00:11:39.589 --> 00:11:42.380
effective and so I love like you know I

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:47.000
you know I love your kind of your you

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.370
know your alpha lobster approach of

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.040
being like I'm gonna [ __ ] you know

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.709
challenge this dragon head on I'm gonna

00:11:54.709 --> 00:11:57.560
put myself into you know take tank

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.690
taking an angio genic drug which

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.060
marijuana is can we agree on that would

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.430
you say exegetical you mean like don't

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.670
you feel like it so you had marijuana

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.410
induced panic attacks for sure

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:14.120
is that yeah yeah same here so and like

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.120
yeah it's fun but I feel you know I I

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.980
feel like it tends to cause a lot of

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.680
people more anxiety especially you know

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.810
when you're when you're when you're

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.779
intoxicated but your attitude about it

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:28.910
is it's like I'm gonna [ __ ] go to the

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.310
belly of the beast you know in this

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:35.810
altered state and challenge my toxic

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.790
thought patterns head-on yeah exactly

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.310
like wait it's like weight training yeah

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.130
for sure yeah and the people looking

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.480
people don't get me like I'm crazy I'll

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.829
tell them and they're like what the [ __ ]

00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:46.790
you talking about I'm like no I'm

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.350
serious like if you can get out of like

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.390
I know I'm gonna eat an edible and watch

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.640
Avengers and oh wow you can do that too

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.279
but it's like if you sit in a [ __ ]

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:58.310
room alone by yourself and you chomp one

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.600
of those things you start feeling funny

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.430
and you just focus on like you're just

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.740
deepest darkest thoughts it's like you

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.480
know stuff hate stuff happens it is like

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.130
a natural catalyst tonight yeah and I

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.630
don't I know people who like I think

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.860
there's two types of people though

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.449
because there's some people who like can

00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:13.310
just smoke weed they're like I'm relaxed

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.839
and like if I do something where I'm

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:16.220
about to be on edge about the last thing

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.420
I'm gonna do before I do that

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.820
we'd because I'm not gonna be on foot

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.400
mean it kind of does help sometimes like

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.890
that but it's like I don't know the last

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.330
like two hours of it yes but if I

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.860
chopped inedible and I go into like an

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.480
uncomfortable situation it's not gonna

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.050
relax me at all for sure and it speaks

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.880
to it speaks to the farm code you know

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.860
genetics like there are yeah there's

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.740
some [ __ ] just monsters that can

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.470
smoke like a grand in their face I'd be

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.020
in the hospital crying really like I

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.250
can't what's weird is I can smoke like

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.500
tons of weed and I can you know function

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.280
do my thing

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.170
and I don't really bug out from smoking

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.030
weed but if the edibles it's just the

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.770
way they come on is I think it's cuz

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.900
they come on like you going about your

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.850
day and all of a sudden you're like they

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.100
the way they said on is not randomly but

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.110
it's like it upon you it's not as you're

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.700
doing the thing that you're associating

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.990
with it so like you're smoking it's

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.670
hitting you you can kind of like control

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.770
smoking more smoke less the edible you

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.780
eat that thing and it's just like here

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.220
we go I don't know how strong this is

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.460
gonna be or what it's just like blue

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.750
what were you saying though there's some

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.460
like you

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.820
by virtue of digesting it aren't there

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.860
some you know psychoactive compounds

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.240
that are I think your liver or your

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.610
liver adds something to it yeah so when

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.080
you when it goes through your liver it's

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.910
like not yeah you like you're exactly

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.590
it's not the exact same thing as smoking

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.360
it's like cuz you if you eat enough of

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.610
that you can have a good like a you can

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.680
like trip I even go on trip I've eaten

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.270
so much that before that I've literally

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.060
like Saul [ __ ] that wasn't all you know

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.800
when I was yeah even just like little

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.030
things out of the corner of your eye

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.340
like I its yeah you can definitely if

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.700
you eat enough weed you don't it was

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.590
like one of those things it was such a

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.440
quick like I I get this anyway normally

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.580
really look and I get like little things

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.080
in the corner of my eye I've always had

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.540
that but this was like a bull leprechaun

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.570
I do have leprechauns anything around me

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.110
[Laughter]

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.270
but the I've had it where it was like

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.310
and I think this is kind of what a

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.130
vision is it's like when you get so so

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.480
like you know if you're young strong if

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.470
we edible you can enter into a daydream

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.790
that you can almost like it again this

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.020
is going to sound like you know like

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.610
really intense and it's not but it's

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.620
like you could enter into a daydream

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.190
that's

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.780
strong that you can almost project it on

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.100
to the outside world of what you're

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.440
saying because I remember like I saw

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.200
like just take a green kind of glow

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.690
around me that I then perceived as might

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.490
like as definitive proof of my soul and

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.980
I was you know I was younger but I had

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.990
eaten so [ __ ] much because I used to

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.550
not know about milligram egde so I would

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.110
just like dump weed in his stuff and eat

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.250
as much as I could and just be like

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.740
immobile for like seven hours so I

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.720
remember I think that that's a common

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.700
theme right people describe this sort of

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.610
like halo that they see on others as yes

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.010
they're like seeing a soul range that's

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.110
yes it was real weird I remember it was

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.850
just like this grim [ __ ] field around

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.290
me that I was like whoa cool and you

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.550
know I just went away like I saw it

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.840
there then I went away so it's kind of

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.670
like an extended flash of the eye and I

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:17.030
was like well it was cool so yeah dude

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.410
you're Europe you're you talk in your

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.510
like a mental warrior and I decided

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.030
backs it up and so you know concept is

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.390
that all of these psychedelics whether

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:33.050
it be you know the psilocybin Academy

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.450
Academy NAND wall to a lesser degree but

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:41.120
they have a similar target and that is

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.550
the the 5-ht or the serotonin serotonin

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.570
2a receptor specifically and that

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.470
thought to be important in in

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.240
neuroplasticity and neurogenesis so they

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.180
feed so for folks okay it's a lot you

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.640
know long story short here people take

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.480
SSRIs increases the cells neurogenesis

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.220
and hippocampus specifically it's kind

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.890
of like a memory center important for

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.050
regulating mood with ketut with ketamine

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:15.040
and which is now actually indicated for

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.329
treatment-resistant depression same

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:20.480
should happens neurogenesis increases

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.480
synapses in the hippocampus same [ __ ]

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.850
with [ __ ] ECT or electroconvulsive

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.189
therapy so all of these different yeah

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:30.700
all these different sort of modalities

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.440
you know have a common sort of final

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.410
pathway but what you're doing is you're

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.110
putting yourself into that plastic state

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:43.600
with with taking these you know

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.050
psychogenic drugs and then you are

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.720
molding your your brain you're molding

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.880
your mind well you're in this this

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.700
plastic state and that's so [ __ ]

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.960
weird I was literally just thinking

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.220
about that how I think that's exactly

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.630
what it is that if you're literally

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.850
whatever is going on new or chemically

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.290
is and you're putting your brain into a

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.580
plastic state which is why it's so

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.750
uncomfortable because it's like

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.700
everything feels loose and you're not

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.380
sure of anything but if you can kind of

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.230
like dig down and like yeah I don't know

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.820
how to exactly describe it but it is I

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.770
feel like you put yourself in a plastic

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:18.000
state with I think that's what they do

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.550
so that's backed up by scientific oh

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:28.120
yeah that's crazy and you you yeah you

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.440
you found that that's but like your

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.020
neighbor you know the idea like to

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.150
enable the everyman like [ __ ] you can go

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.890
to at you know to the corner and buy a

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:39.970
bag of mushrooms

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.790
hey I'm not endorsing this and sure and

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.380
by the way you know like anything that

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.700
I'm saying I'm just shooting the [ __ ]

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.320
it's not medical advice

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.500
got some anyhow you know you you know

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.120
you know the everyman can go to the

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.470
corner and buy a bag of mushrooms and

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.370
you know for someone that's you know

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.470
trying has tried different lines of

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.910
therapy and and they're really

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:07.530
frustrated and have this sort of

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.540
self-guided spiritual awakening

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.630
themselves you know as opposed to going

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.290
and paying some [ __ ] I took the

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.720
number of people that have a therapist

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.470
holy [ __ ] yeah I don't know here's

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.150
here's how I feel about it it's like I

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.910
was always highly reluctant about talk

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.620
therapy just just I think just because

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.410
of like my own personal up ring it was

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.450
like they would be like yeah like that's

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.640
for [ __ ] psychos you don't need to do

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.340
that but I think talk therapy is good

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.160
it's just so [ __ ] expensive that it's

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.990
like I don't know how people can do it

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.270
like it's like if it's covered you in

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:51.460
the talking huh me pretty much yeah I

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.050
see someone who I see it's like I only

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.760
can deal with like psychodynamic

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.320
therapists people who at least

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.400
acknowledge like the young

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.750
on chess and all the role that plays I

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.430
can't really [ __ ] with CBT and all that

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.290
other stuff and which I heard has helped

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.990
people but I like personally I like the

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.430
you know the stuff that it's geared to

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.690
her subconscious thought patterns and

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.030
blah blah blah but you're saying yeah so

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.860
it's really mostly me but then you know

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.230
she kind of shall interject and kind of

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.720
a sounding board yeah so also some up

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.640
like I'll say stuff and she'll summarize

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.840
it and say it back to me and I'm like

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.820
yes is exactly what I was trying to

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.170
express but couldn't right right

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.400
definitely definitely value there I

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.820
dunno well you know I should say that

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.830
like you know there's there's various

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.950
self-help books including you know and I

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.540
have no association with this guy but

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.570
mind over mood that are popular and

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.480
there's been studies that show that that

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.230
CBT or you know a psychologist driven

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.520
CBT is as effective as people that

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.650
earnestly engage and self-help programs

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.590
sure so this this is available to people

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.630
this is available you know this you know

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:03.460
that books 25 bucks on on Amazon your

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.010
you know your your psychologist is what

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.200
hundred dollars an hour yeah I see like

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.910
a licensed clinical social worker but

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.620
yeah it's like 80 bucks 80 bucks an hour

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.210
and then with insurance I think it'll

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.820
drop but still it's like it's not it

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.200
should be way more accessible and cheap

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.880
for people that's that's why I kind of

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.200
like psychedelics which is like you can

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.930
do these things and like like the CBT

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.880
stuff is cool like cognitive distortions

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.080
and all that like that's cool to be able

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.820
to recognize but the thing I think is

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.190
cool is being able to like get a whole

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:31.990
if you can like you know wrap your head

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.030
around the unconscious the theory of the

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.460
unconscious and then find out negative

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.810
unconscious thought patterns you have

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.780
and then stop them become what you

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.280
become once you learn what it is you

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.560
become like I was telling uh my buddy

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.690
the other day I did the last time I was

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.430
eating like like a small dose of

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.120
mushrooms and and weed I literally came

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.500
to the realization that I have this

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.110
weird polarity where it's like or I have

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.110
like a polar nulling neuroses where it's

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.840
like a inferiority complex coupled with

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.450
a Authority issue so it's like I'm

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.100
constantly deferring authority to other

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.840
people and then resenting them even

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.720
though I'm deferring my

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.039
authority to them and it just goes in

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:14.659
this never-ending [ __ ] loop where it's

00:22:14.659 --> 00:22:16.309
like I'm like okay okay okay then like

00:22:16.309 --> 00:22:17.600
what the [ __ ] this sucks what am I doing

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.549
this and that was like I give you the

00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:25.370
the the perspective or allow you to sort

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.250
of step out of yourself and objectively

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.039
analyze things or how do you think you

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:33.740
were enabled by the mushroom that's the

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.280
and that's the mystery so it's like the

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.260
so why the all the ideas of like you

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.610
know authority issues blah blah blah

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:41.870
blah that was from going to think of

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.549
therapist and this lady just kind of

00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:45.110
just gently bringing it to my attention

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.390
like yeah I think you have authority

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.159
you're like okay whatever but then like

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:50.450
yeah and this is something I've been

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.980
reading a lot with the young books where

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.400
it's like in order to actually resolve

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.539
like a real conflict cuz you're

00:22:56.539 --> 00:22:57.679
conscious you have your consciousness

00:22:57.679 --> 00:22:59.270
and then you have you know on your

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.770
unconscious mind which your

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.960
consciousness came out of the solution

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.850
to these problems of the mind has to

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.890
arise naturally because if you just

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.780
deduce it like logically with like you

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.730
know you're you know you like your

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.950
cortex if you're just kind of like and

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.570
this is a problem I guess isn't a deep

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:15.799
emotional problem that I'm gonna

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:17.150
rationalize my I'm gonna like you know

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.400
use a purely rational thinking tends to

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.530
not work again the mushroom State were

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.650
like you don't buy and these are and

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.049
these are oftentimes subjective things

00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:30.620
so you know like what I see so what I

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.510
see that common and so and so what you

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.370
mentioned you know you identified these

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.500
two neuroses and and that was through

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.940
like you know sort of psychoanalysis

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.190
right sure and that's and that's helpful

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.870
and you're like okay well you know this

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.720
is some underlying pathology but on a

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.070
day to day basis what you know what is

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.570
preventing you from sort of achieving

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.669
your goals or interfering with your

00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:54.799
effectiveness so what I see time and

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:58.720
time again is perseveration people that

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:03.620
obsess on a harmful or depressive

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.740
thought or or pattern of thinking yeah

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.390
whether it's insecurity or you know I

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.150
think about one woman who was obsessing

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.159
about infidelity

00:24:13.159 --> 00:24:17.240
so she was she had a what she could

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.890
acknowledge was a unrealistic and not

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.840
based in reality concerned that her

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.010
husband was

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.020
was was not being faithful and it

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.140
occupied she would estimate over 50% of

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.370
her thoughts him

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.720
so this woman's going around you know

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.059
she's washing dishes she's like [ __ ] my

00:24:35.059 --> 00:24:36.559
husband's younger his dick sucks right

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:36.799
now

00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:38.809
yeah she's walking the dog you know you

00:24:38.809 --> 00:24:41.150
know what I mean so yeah and I feel and

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.860
I hear that time and time again sort of

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.970
this is this this this thinking pattern

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.000
that needs to be like you said you know

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.710
stop you need to identify what this

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.200
toxic thinking pattern is and you need

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.390
to stop it easier said than done so I

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.040
think like with these with these

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.950
psychedelics it puts like you said

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.750
surgery it puts you into this plastic

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.720
state where you can you can interfere

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.730
with things or you can sort of reset

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.460
your you know your system of coordinates

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.679
where where you can you can get outside

00:25:12.679 --> 00:25:15.740
of that toxic circuit which is you know

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.580
which is a there's like a neuroanatomy

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.070
sort of correlate like you need to break

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:26.450
it somehow obviously you're doing it

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.040
with thoughts which is the weirdest part

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.640
of it yeah willing you're willing

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.710
yourself out of it but I think yeah I

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.120
think sometimes you need a bit of a

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.299
crutch sure but no that's good yeah

00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:39.919
grazie dude and it's like so the wait

00:25:39.919 --> 00:25:41.660
the when you're saying that it would it

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.330
made me think of his like so the way the

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.790
like the mushrooms help is like so I can

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.049
like you know I'll go to therapy she's

00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:49.160
like you have authority issues I'm like

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.809
I have authority issues blah blah blah I

00:25:50.809 --> 00:25:52.340
kind of have this weird like you know

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.400
I'll defer Authority at the same time

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.140
I'll still like like the for instance my

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.280
girlfriend I haven't seen you all day

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.750
you have to come lay down in bed with me

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.250
then I'll lay down in bed with her and

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.510
she's like why are you falling asleep I

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.549
can't but I'm like it takes me a while

00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:07.910
to be like basically well it's also it's

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.200
like you have to do this and I'm like

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.059
okay and then you if once you're like

00:26:11.059 --> 00:26:12.830
you know I live years of my life like

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.809
that you know what you know but here and

00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:16.160
there I'd obviously like rise up my no

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.799
no but automatically I beg yes this is

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:20.210
what I have to do now rather than being

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:21.890
know what just being like instinctively

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.809
like no I don't so like that was

00:26:23.809 --> 00:26:24.980
something that I had to like kind of

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.929
learn to do but the so like you can hear

00:26:26.929 --> 00:26:28.490
that you have that issue and you're okay

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.110
I could see that what the mushrooms do

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.460
like you said it puts you in a plastic

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.200
state we're like now you can feel it and

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.090
you're like you feel the fact that you

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.740
can like no I don't have to do that and

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.480
it's it's like it's more it's

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.340
real to you it's real to like the other

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.809
half of your mind in a way which gets

00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:43.910
like accepted and bought into in a way

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.200
that changes your conscious thought

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.390
pattern which is so and again this is

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.010
his theory but it's like that's how it

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:51.760
feels like to me

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:54.740
yeah when you look in the mirror I'm

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.120
happy I'm happy like the Tony Robbins

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.190
stuff I'm happy I'm happy you smile a

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.410
change of physiology and it's like yeah

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:14.570
man I guess but like the psychoanalysis

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:20.059
talk therapy enables sort of identifying

00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:22.450
what the issue what the issue is but

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:25.330
intervening on that thought pattern

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.200
requires something else

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.809
sounding some [ __ ] some enlightening

00:27:29.809 --> 00:27:31.880
experience and for some people that's

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.580
vigorous you know physical exercise for

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.960
some people that's going to [ __ ] Peru

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.510
and you know going in cheering some

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.669
ayahuasca with some truck and you know

00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:43.490
chief then whatever it may be but it has

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.950
to be some like highly salient event

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.169
because otherwise you're just you know

00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:49.610
you're just going through the motions

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.710
you can be as cognitively aware as it's

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.330
possible but if you're not acknowledging

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:57.280
this underlying sort of subconscious

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.230
pattern of thinking you're not going to

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.460
be able to intervene on that

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.960
exactly and that's that's mean well like

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.669
I think you know the data front like so

00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:11.630
for example folks from V is not like

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:14.380
Vietnam vets and they were all [ __ ]

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:19.309
smoking opium and you know you would

00:28:19.309 --> 00:28:23.780
have anticipated a huge epidemic of

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.150
addiction when they came back but they

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.669
their patterns their their frame of

00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:31.030
reference their surroundings were

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.309
completely changed from the [ __ ] you

00:28:34.309 --> 00:28:37.190
know Vietcong jungle back to their

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:41.419
factory job that those you know the

00:28:41.419 --> 00:28:43.040
system of Corbett's weren't there

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.350
anymore to reinforce the drug habit and

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.110
so they were able to easily there to

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:51.890
kick it much more easily than what have

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:53.180
then would have been anticipated for

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.130
people yeah that's so [ __ ] weird I've

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.780
came across that before and said that I

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.070
remember I said it to Shane he was like

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.000
no [ __ ] way

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.620
it's like I don't know I mean that's

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.500
what I read isn't that crazy

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.660
yeah wasn't there something similar too

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.820
and like [ __ ] was it Vancouver that what

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.590
there was a part I forget what city it

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.090
was in Canada but there was a good the

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:12.830
east side of Vancouver some city I

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.420
forget which it was but they had like a

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.160
horrible there heroin problem then there

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.990
was a job yeah there was a drought one

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.190
time they said well there's no heroin

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:20.720
and people just like didn't really have

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.360
the withdrawal for some weird why they

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.470
went into it but there was some like

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.670
documented case where they said the

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:26.960
people didn't really tend to have like

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.840
withdrawal as bad which is weird to be I

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.980
don't know that's strange

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.840
yeah like the heroin dried up for like

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.550
just like months at a time and

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:43.730
apparently but I think people step kept

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.560
going about their like little ritual of

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.390
like buying and like just buying other

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.000
[ __ ] and whatever but there the person

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.500
who was interviewing someone who had

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.090
like been lived through that it was

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.410
saying like yeah we didn't really like

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:56.000
we didn't really fall into withdrawal

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
which is weird right that's really

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.800
wasn't it and they were probably

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.630
shooting up like more and more dilute

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:04.880
drugs the spirit of going through the

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.320
motions you know was for them sort of a

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.440
way to sort of lean off the drug oh yeah

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.870
no it's awful though like I mean you

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:18.050
guys I think in and Fillion and

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:23.000
certainly you know in the Rust Belt and

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.370
stuff like that I've got just a terrible

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.550
opiate problem we do as well and around

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:32.480
my eye area and yeah and who knows like

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.320
what like why are we not exploring

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.470
[ __ ] the potential value of solutions

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:43.940
I think that well first of all there's

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.200
there's no you know Purdue pharmacy

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.480
that's going to fund you know clinical

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.820
trials on [ __ ] mushrooms that some

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.130
guys growing runners the dog [ __ ] in

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:58.610
this closet exactly so that's a big

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:02.030
problem but it's just it's it's

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:04.190
something that we need to be a more

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.480
open-minded we need

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.610
we need to accept that we don't know

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.799
what the [ __ ] going on in the brain

00:31:09.799 --> 00:31:12.440
and we you know we need to explore

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.080
different options yeah well it also like

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.179
I said it it also takes people out of a

00:31:17.179 --> 00:31:18.950
you know not everyone but I feel like it

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.270
kind of slows down like that crazed like

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.380
consumerist drive like if you start if

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.299
you chant any I don't know why this is

00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:28.160
but chances are like if you do mushrooms

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.890
enough times like you'll somehow most

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.169
times tend to develop this like general

00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:35.630
disdain for like trying to buy your way

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.429
into happiness you know and again I'm

00:31:37.429 --> 00:31:38.840
not like you know appreciate just some

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.340
that's a weird effect of these kind of

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:41.870
drugs or kind of stops people from

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:43.250
getting into like what people would

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.960
perceive as like more shallows endeavour

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.700
for my contentedness and you know if

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:49.580
you're you know running businesses based

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.679
on like by people buying as much useful

00:31:51.679 --> 00:31:53.450
[ __ ] as possible it's like mushrooms are

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.549
pretty bad for that business you know

00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:57.080
mushroom faster that we'd all that stuff

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.040
it's pretty bad for that business

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:04.850
yeah I've also been a yoga classes where

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:07.010
like I've heard like you know the the

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.080
teacher like give this non materialist

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.419
like you know blah blah blah speech and

00:32:11.419 --> 00:32:12.980
then literally in the same breath be

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.540
like oh there's this new sound Bowl they

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.890
came out with I gotta get it it's like

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:17.900
limited edition so I think you know no

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.520
matter what they're always be dumb [ __ ]

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:27.200
people always buy it so yeah I mean I

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.340
don't know what what your state's

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.710
legislation on marijuana is but we as of

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:36.760
October of last year had national

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.610
legalization how is that going and so

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.530
well it's being rolled out gradually so

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:46.150
right now there's only a few licensed

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:49.190
distributors and it's it's it's

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.110
provincially regulated just like our

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:55.340
alcohol like there's a control board so

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.919
the the producers distribute through

00:32:57.919 --> 00:33:00.590
like a crown corp and it's all done by

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:04.490
mail and I like it so and again and this

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:07.340
is sort of the again this is very this

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.720
is heard of these yeah opposite

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.870
perspective is around cannabis induced

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.750
psychosis so I don't think we know

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:18.890
enough about

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:21.760
the effects you know the 70-odd

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.400
chemicals in cannabis for unrestricted

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.230
access especially among young people

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:32.450
sure and you know the physicians in

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.000
Ontario and you know have have a

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.640
position statement where medicinal

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.140
marijuana is not to be described to

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.799
folks less than 25 so it was really

00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:45.020
interesting hearing I don't know if you

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:48.799
heard the Rogan cast with Mike Hart no

00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:52.370
so he did he the doc oh he fought yeah I

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.440
love the guy but anyhow he's a dark from

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.650
London Ontario which is relatively small

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:02.390
town many calls himself a cannabis

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.750
practitioner he's cut you got one drug

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.300
in his pharmacopoeia you just you

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.159
prescribe and of course he focuses on

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:12.859
like mental illness and disorder and

00:34:12.859 --> 00:34:14.960
then various like autoimmune disorders

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.530
but the idea that that we have a

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.800
scientific understanding of how like

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.480
yeah the you know the synergy of those

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.300
70 odd [ __ ] psychoactive compounds

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.429
and we want to simplify tale you know

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:32.270
this is THC I or this is CBD I ain't

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:35.990
even in Dakota City yeah okay that's not

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:39.800
[ __ ] kid in me and like so we had cat

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.899
the catatonic psychosis means that his

00:34:41.899 --> 00:34:43.879
[ __ ] his hallucinations are so

00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:45.980
extreme that he can't even interact with

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:49.010
the external world wait he had that and

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.440
now so he had that pre-existing or was

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.639
that you said that was triggered by it

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:57.050
it was like so the thought is that

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:00.770
people that have a predisposition to

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.230
psychotic illness sure will have their

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:07.640
symptoms unmasked by by by cannabis yeah

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.650
so like there's there's an early there's

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:11.420
some data that there's an earlier age of

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.440
onset for heavy marijuana users

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.200
especially at that family history simply

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.390
schizophrenia yeah but you know you

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.940
bring something up like that to my card

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.760
he's like oh you know is probably he was

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.230
probably smoking a sativa but you should

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:29.280
have been smoking in an indica

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.309
[Laughter]

00:35:33.309 --> 00:35:38.839
yeah he's boiling down his leg do you

00:35:38.839 --> 00:35:40.609
know hallucinations like he should have

00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:42.589
smoked like Skywalker versus Sour Diesel

00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:46.089
it's like I do yeah that's like yeah

00:35:46.089 --> 00:35:48.229
yeah yeah that's really that gets

00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:49.640
annoying too and people get too invested

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.799
in it and they're there they try to make

00:35:51.799 --> 00:35:55.579
weed like this totally there's no

00:35:55.579 --> 00:35:58.009
negative aspects at all it's like 100%

00:35:58.009 --> 00:36:00.799
you know the cure for everything it's

00:36:00.799 --> 00:36:02.960
like now because it definitely does

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.910
anything can bug you out and I knew I

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:06.680
actually knew a guy and this was like

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.109
[ __ ] man nobody wanted to hear this but

00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:11.509
they're in this dude smoke like upwards

00:36:11.509 --> 00:36:12.859
you know he really smoked with other

00:36:12.859 --> 00:36:14.779
people but he pretty reliably smoked

00:36:14.779 --> 00:36:16.670
like almost an ounce a week he would do

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.349
all the dabs all the time yeah this guy

00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:20.269
smoked a lot of [ __ ] weed he would do

00:36:20.269 --> 00:36:23.299
dabs constantly all this [ __ ] and he

00:36:23.299 --> 00:36:25.279
actually had that um I forget what it's

00:36:25.279 --> 00:36:26.599
called it's actually a disease he went

00:36:26.599 --> 00:36:27.650
to three different doctors because he

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.239
didn't want to believe that it's like a

00:36:29.239 --> 00:36:32.749
it's a cannabinoid induced like disease

00:36:32.749 --> 00:36:34.460
of the intestines were like his

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.650
intestines were kind of like not I think

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.029
telescope or they would do this thing

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:39.739
where we're like kicking spasm real hard

00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:42.769
and you have to go to interception

00:36:42.769 --> 00:36:45.769
potentially so and I don't mean but

00:36:45.769 --> 00:36:47.089
surely there's something called there's

00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:49.430
an entity called cyclical vomiting

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:52.460
syndrome which is related to marijuana

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.079
and and the reason why I bring it up

00:36:54.079 --> 00:36:55.729
with because it's relieved by hot

00:36:55.729 --> 00:37:02.749
showers the exact roll up and take which

00:37:02.749 --> 00:37:04.369
is funny he instead he would sit in a

00:37:04.369 --> 00:37:06.049
hot bath you would like just like man

00:37:06.049 --> 00:37:08.059
there but he said he was different

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:10.009
doctors and they finally the all three

00:37:10.009 --> 00:37:11.359
told him that and he goes I can't argue

00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:13.479
this anymore and here to cut back

00:37:13.479 --> 00:37:16.940
showing in in my neck of the woods

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.999
that's like a common presentation really

00:37:19.999 --> 00:37:22.369
so like yeah like the emerge tox would

00:37:22.369 --> 00:37:24.079
be like yep you know cyclical bonder

00:37:24.079 --> 00:37:27.410
like yeah [ __ ] hot shower now the

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:28.789
problem with suggesting that is that

00:37:28.789 --> 00:37:30.349
they can pass out and shower as well but

00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:32.029
yeah that's hilarious everybody just

00:37:32.029 --> 00:37:34.339
kind of like came upon that therapy yeah

00:37:34.339 --> 00:37:35.690
just literally start taking he's like I

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:37.369
need to take a hot bath otherwise he's

00:37:37.369 --> 00:37:38.660
like because he would sit in the bathtub

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.309
for like hours me like dude I'm gonna

00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:42.230
take a bath like my stomach's [ __ ] up

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.310
is that from do you think that has

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:44.390
anything to do with the fact that it

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.220
lowers your stomach acid and if you

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.680
lower your stomach acid over time for

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.000
like a decade that you're not like

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
breaking down food properly could be I

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.480
mean to the extent that that I know

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.980
about it so obviously marijuana has huge

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.650
effects on on serotonergic systems and

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:06.920
your gut is serotonin driven well and so

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.290
like yeah so even folks that that are

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:15.130
taking SSRIs it's a good prognostic or

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:18.109
it's a good prognostic sign if they have

00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:20.930
GI or gastrointestinal side effects

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:23.030
because it suggests that they're going

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.760
to respond to the drug so it's kind of

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.470
interesting that's why they call your

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:30.530
stomach except in green it's yours that

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:32.300
you add you this has all those herbs and

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.970
[ __ ] yeah it's crazy it's funny because

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.470
I feel like so I'm in Social Work school

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:37.580
now and I feel like they tell you like

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.200
one fourth over they tell medical

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.430
professionals so you can just like you

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:41.810
like kind of heard of a bunch of stuff

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.010
they say like oh that's what that is

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.100
cool

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.210
whatwhat's the end game they're like do

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:52.930
you think yeah yeah I want to work with

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.820
initially like especially you know more

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.470
or less pretty much anyone but I want to

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:00.260
focus on boys that have young boys that

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.330
have behavioral issues in school like

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.740
grade school high school and then

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.680
eventually on disorder exactly chronic

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.230
disorder OCD all that stuff and then you

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.640
know do that if I like that I'll just

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.230
keep doing that I also want to do some

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.850
work in prisons to see like you know how

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:15.320
that turns out and kind of deal with

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.790
people in prison and see if you can like

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:18.500
because there's like people in prison

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.020
you can reliably assume a huge majority

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.119
of them are operating on like very

00:39:23.119 --> 00:39:25.670
negative and flawed thought patterns so

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:29.410
my hue my super goal would be to Nevitt

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.730
eventually enter some sort of

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:33.560
psychedelic therapy in a prison setting

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.000
which you know it's like good [ __ ]

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.950
luck but I want to I think I said

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:44.540
obviously I've worked in some prisons

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:49.760
and I mean they have so no no obviously

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.770
like you've identified they have no like

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:53.869
pervasive antisocial personality

00:39:53.869 --> 00:39:55.850
disorder but

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.280
the substance abuse is like the opiate

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.010
abuse is just insane yeah and it's

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:02.420
obvious all brought in through prison

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.820
guards so everyone and their brothers on

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.680
suboxone or you know these various

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.780
they're all taking think about lyric

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.930
every Gavilan to to deal with their

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:22.160
addiction because what do you say do you

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.710
have any mentorship like opportunities

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:28.760
like to go into and no I mean I have

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.210
like um I know a couple people who like

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.590
like I know a defense attorney who

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:35.930
actually like is really plugged in with

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.240
the prisons I I was supposed to work

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.340
there for like my fieldwork last year

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.320
but they kind of like something God you

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.460
know there's some insurance should

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.670
happen I couldn't do it but I want to

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.110
kind of go I also want to get like a

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:49.730
teaching certificate and teach in prison

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.380
even just like I was like thinking that

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.220
I was like I would love to teach

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.570
philosophy in prison but now like

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:54.950
working with people I'm like I'm gonna

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:56.450
just teach basic literacy you know I'm

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.220
not gonna like I'd rather just that

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.200
would be way more you know it sounds

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.000
cool to like hit these guys with like

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.710
cool stuff about most words need to

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:12.440
learn how to [ __ ] read it a GED 20

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.800
years yeah but basically they need to

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.410
learn how to read the guys I deal with

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:19.760
with his knees like I would talk to them

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.990
and they you know most people because I

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.100
was doing housing for a while and it's

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.560
like they just needed basic literacy to

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.090
go get a GED that way they could get a

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.340
job for more than like 750 or 8 bucks an

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.650
hour but but yeah I wanted to so I want

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:32.240
to do that I eventually want to start my

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.500
own private practice to that is

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.630
basically you know it would be because

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:38.330
I'm more of like a like and again I

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:40.220
don't have like clinical hours but I

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.230
just from the stuff I read and the stuff

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:44.090
I apply to myself and like I want to do

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:45.560
a practice that's kind of like more from

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.220
like a psychodynamic Jungian theory and

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.500
then kind of in just kind of work in

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.150
these like psychedelics especially doing

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.920
like the low dose stuff to kind of get

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.020
someone more or less like like I was

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.220
talking about with you with the book is

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.380
like coming up with an exposure therapy

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.870
for anxiety with the with small amounts

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:04.310
of these things and then coupled with

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:06.530
like someone there to talk to you like I

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.060
do these things by myself and when I bug

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:09.680
out I just have to bug the [ __ ] out

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.420
like you know deal with it but if you

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.980
had people you know in there where

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.390
you're dealing with a practitioner who

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:15.619
could sit with you and they talk you

00:42:15.619 --> 00:42:17.420
through like it'll be especially helpful

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.940
while you're sucking out your true true

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.900
shaman thank your God like like guiding

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.450
a you know a Vision Quest so and that

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:28.520
that's a defined field I forget it has

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.380
some name but you know like like you're

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.630
like that's that's sort of the you know

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:36.349
field and I think you know it had more

00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:39.680
buy-in along like a while ago and then

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.390
obviously psychedelics fell out of favor

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:44.569
sure but maybe they'll be a bit of a

00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:47.270
Renaissance Nick was especially if you

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:48.470
have someone in therapy and you know you

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:50.599
know people will just basically like you

00:42:50.599 --> 00:42:51.980
know put up their normal walls or in

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:53.150
there they're like I don't know I'm cool

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:54.410
nothing's bothering me but then if you

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:56.630
could get them like reliably in a state

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:58.490
of like where all the [ __ ] that's

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.559
bothering them comes up then in there

00:43:00.559 --> 00:43:02.329
then you could really I think address it

00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:03.740
and it would just I think save people

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.170
tons of money and time on therapy where

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:07.339
it's like you could do a couple sessions

00:43:07.339 --> 00:43:08.869
a month and then you know take this

00:43:08.869 --> 00:43:10.339
little micro dose or you know or a

00:43:10.339 --> 00:43:12.050
bigger dose if you want and then talk

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.400
through all these like just you know

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.809
wall a spell you're saying in this

00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:16.520
plastic state deal with all your issues

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.619
and have someone there to like you know

00:43:18.619 --> 00:43:20.000
stood there take care of you we're

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.650
really like some a medical professional

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:23.660
who could if need be like prescribes to

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:25.549
enhance anxiety medication said in case

00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:26.809
you really start freaking the [ __ ] out

00:43:26.809 --> 00:43:29.420
so yeah that's what I want to thank you

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.160
you can call it you know the project

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:38.150
MKULTRA yeah but that's it so yeah like

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.609
in terms of rolling it out like yeah

00:43:40.609 --> 00:43:42.589
like you'd have a you know you don't

00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:45.859
have a prescriber or [ __ ] if these

00:43:45.859 --> 00:43:47.780
people are going to source it you know

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:52.069
illicitly that's maybe their their you

00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:53.990
know their prerogative as well hmm but

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:55.849
you know something like mushrooms like

00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:58.700
what's the worst that can happen now if

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.500
they have some like drug you know

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.869
drug-induced emergent psychosis sure

00:44:02.869 --> 00:44:05.630
you're on the line but how the [ __ ] how

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:07.490
often does that should happen boy

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:09.260
exactly and it would be nice to know

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.309
they'll be able to end if you were like

00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:11.510
so if you could really couple this with

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:13.640
like the you know regular talk therapy

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.069
it's like you could talk to someone get

00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:17.839
to know them for like months and then be

00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:19.099
like alright I've talked to you for a

00:44:19.099 --> 00:44:20.390
couple months we're ready know you I

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:21.799
think you'd be fine with us make the

00:44:21.799 --> 00:44:23.299
journey yeah well someone was hitting

00:44:23.299 --> 00:44:23.630
red

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:24.890
flags you could be like yeah I don't

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:26.150
feel comfortable doing this with you

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.740
personally you know and like you know

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:29.900
I'm not gonna do this so yeah it would

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.430
be a bit of a judgment call on a person

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:32.780
I guess like you know me or whoever is

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.430
doing it to be like get to know this

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:35.930
person feel the Malick's you can you can

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:37.850
kind of feel out people's psyche

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:39.770
Constitution's pretty well for the most

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:41.060
part you might be surprised I'm sure

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.190
here and there but but yes that's the

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:45.140
point I want to try to get that rolling

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.210
something like that rolling in

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:49.280
Philadelphia but I think even you could

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.140
even start a peer group where that could

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.940
be applied by just like you know have

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.680
like you just get a church basement and

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.300
have like a word of mouth like this is

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.920
what we're all gonna do in a peer group

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.660
and see how it goes and then you know

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:02.450
and try to like build it from there yeah

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:03.980
and then you don't have the liability

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.440
either exact you know you're just kind

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.960
of like facilitating it I so something

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.660
like that has to exist for ketamine

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.060
because ketamine is now FDA and

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.250
indicated for treatment resistant

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:20.240
depression so I don't know like I guess

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.950
it's not really because they give like

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:24.140
dissociative doses so I don't know what

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.510
what you take on the street all right I

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:28.760
don't know unlike someone to be like in

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.340
a k-hole you're taking about a milligram

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.080
per kilogram intravenously

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.780
so for these folks they need to be they

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:37.760
need to be monitored you know they need

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.350
to be on like cardiac leads there has to

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:41.540
be like at least a nurse that's that's

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.850
there there are risks associated with

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:46.340
ketamine like it can it can actually

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:49.130
increase like ICP or intracranial

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:53.150
pressure there's no real like like that

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:55.310
the respiratory depression risks let

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:57.920
like opiates cause it like there's

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.750
really no risk really indicated mean but

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.630
it's not a totally totally benign drug

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:05.960
like some people you know what to think

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.390
that it is whereas I don't know I don't

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:09.830
know the first thing about mushrooms but

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:12.560
like you know I presumably no one's ever

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.760
[ __ ] overdosed really yeah I don't

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.050
think there's a way you could get down

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:19.580
as much without throwing it up any I

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:20.750
think your body will naturally if you

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.730
start eating anywhere even in the realm

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:25.040
I think the guy Paul Stamets talks about

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.170
this how like you know you'd have to eat

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:29.450
I forget what it is but it's so much

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:30.920
that it would be really difficult to do

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.390
unless they started like concentrating

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:34.370
it really hard but even still I think

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:35.510
your body would just throw it all but if

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:36.910
I mean if you somehow a conscience

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.430
into like a super super dude well what

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:42.490
about your tinctures have you been

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:44.500
purifying for psilocybin you're using

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.260
like some lemon or [ __ ] Zack well yeah

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.790
that's there's the real way to purify

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:51.340
psilocybin is with [ __ ] what is this

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:52.960
shelf what is this stuff called not

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.180
oh it's methanol I don't I don't do this

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:59.140
cuz I just I'm not really I'm yeah and

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.640
like you let it evaporate off and that

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.230
that's the way they they supposedly do

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:04.540
it again this is like [ __ ] I hear but

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.000
the yeah with for me I'm not really

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.230
trying to like [ __ ] with methanol

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:09.310
because I'll end up like burning my

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:13.120
[ __ ] face off exactly I'm not good at

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.740
all chemical I still have like a weird

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.680
chemical phobia but the yeah if you just

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.120
put a little bit of mushroom powder and

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.610
let it the citric acid activate the

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.260
psilocybin and they're like this'll Osen

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:24.790
that actually that can kick in a little

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:26.140
faster and takes off some of that

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.350
stomach discomfort but the ketamine [ __ ]

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:31.300
freaks me out because it's like my I've

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.860
never done ketamine the only times I've

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.440
seen people do it we're like just got

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.120
people like snorting the [ __ ] out of it

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.770
and I've seen people develop kind of

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:40.600
like habit based you know I would call

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.340
like an addiction to ketamine but they

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.470
were also doing so many to other drugs

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:45.730
that they were just kind of addicted to

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:47.950
drugs in general this is like a kind of

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:49.300
like an evil hippie thing I would say

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.370
like I knew guys who would just like

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:53.260
start doing all these drugs but they

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.670
also did a loosening jinn so they'd had

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:56.470
like this like kind of veneer of

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:57.910
positivity about them but in the

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.800
meantime they're just like blowing tons

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.170
of lines and pop and like percocets and

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.180
[ __ ] they trip every now and again so no

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.140
that guy's just a hippie I'm like no

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.240
they're guys addicted to drugs and they

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.030
all the enemy and they I mean I've seen

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:11.470
guys in Kay holes and it just looked

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:13.450
like oh like I would see it be like now

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:18.310
I'm cool on that yeah I mean I but it's

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:21.390
definitely a player yeah I keep reading

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:24.340
yeah I mean I'm like good I'm glad it is

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.570
you know I wouldn't want it to be bad

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:27.580
but it's like I wonder so it's it's

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.140
intravenously I've only seen people like

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.550
snuff like sniff it but it's like so

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.110
you'd have to do it yeah can you do it

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:33.580
in term us curly or does it have to be

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.910
interim Vania Slee um I'm sure you could

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:38.260
I would think that you could do it I am

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.760
as well hmm

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.760
I've only seen it yeah you can you can

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.370
do it I am as well and it's but yeah

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:49.570
it's a much much higher dose gotcha yeah

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:50.710
but yeah I mean

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:53.349
like I don't know man he's [ __ ] these

00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:56.170
guys like raid like vet clinics to like

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:59.800
get the powder and you know snorting it

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.839
obviously there's like no there's no

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:05.020
sort of you know regulation or like you

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.700
know quantification and how much dose

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.740
you're going to get so rolling that out

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:14.670
yeah yeah like a clinical setting like

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.300
you go grab a bag off the corner and

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.920
bring it your baby yes whereas I feel

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.770
like I feel like people have more buy-in

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:25.570
especially you know as we're becoming

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:28.420
more open-minded to like alternative

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:31.270
medicines like eating eating some

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.869
mushrooms

00:49:31.869 --> 00:49:33.400
sure like I'm mush you know I'm a

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.230
mushrooms and mushroom type of thing

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:37.660
like [ __ ] sure there's nothing too scary

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.010
about that no and I don't want it I

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.390
don't want to snap ketamine's I know I

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:42.040
know people who probably were out there

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.330
who like it and I don't know like you

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:44.950
know people like talk [ __ ] on the stuff

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:46.750
I like I avoid people like [ __ ] weed

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:48.339
so emotions and I'm like I'm always like

00:49:48.339 --> 00:49:50.349
[ __ ] you so you know I'm sure it works

00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:51.640
for people are people out there who are

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:52.330
making it work

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:54.220
I've just had bad experiences watching

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.200
people on it but yeah I think a mushroom

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.390
is like for me it's like alright this

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:01.030
thing you know like you're saying grew

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:02.380
out of the ground there's been there's

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.630
history of like thousands of years of

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:06.339
people taking this so like I can rest

00:50:06.339 --> 00:50:07.660
assured that it's pretty cool and it's

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.190
not just like made in the lab where it's

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:10.390
like I don't know what the [ __ ] white

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:12.730
powder is but mushroom even like this is

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:16.390
definitely one of your patients comes

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:18.460
addicted to opiates you give them

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.800
ketamine to get them off his addiction

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:27.310
they becomes addicted to get sounds

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:28.660
ridiculous is it almost sounds like if

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:29.560
someone like you're gonna get addicted

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.910
to mushrooms it's like you just can't

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:33.460
but it's like right and again I don't

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.630
like it people I've heard people you

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:35.950
can't get addicted to ketamine I'm like

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:37.570
I don't know man I've watched people

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:39.010
used to do it like almost every day so

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:40.810
whatever you want to call that I've seen

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:42.580
people do that they they call it hippie

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.250
heroin for a reason but you know right I

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:46.720
hope I'm wrong and you know maybe it was

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.800
laced with something I don't [ __ ]

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.960
know but yeah I hope I almost excited

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.970
for all that [ __ ] like the MDMA all that

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:53.650
stuff to come out and to be just so

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:55.089
people have to buy it like Alissa Lee

00:50:55.089 --> 00:50:57.130
and have it just [ __ ] dirty and lace

00:50:57.130 --> 00:51:01.540
with speed and [ __ ] yeah well yeah I

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.580
mean mushrooms are accessible so

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:05.189
California

00:51:05.189 --> 00:51:10.029
decriminalized psilocybin mushrooms yeah

00:51:10.029 --> 00:51:13.299
I believe I did hear that yeah so who

00:51:13.299 --> 00:51:16.719
knows you know what state it's coming

00:51:16.719 --> 00:51:19.599
Cal to mean look the west coast has

00:51:19.599 --> 00:51:21.219
already been doing it kind of ahead of

00:51:21.219 --> 00:51:23.829
the East Coast where I'm at and wait so

00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:27.609
once what California did was the what

00:51:27.609 --> 00:51:29.709
did they do they did the medical and

00:51:29.709 --> 00:51:31.419
there was a look it's just they they use

00:51:31.419 --> 00:51:33.519
cancer patient I lost your mic there oh

00:51:33.519 --> 00:51:36.189
hey can you hear me yeah yeah I got you

00:51:36.189 --> 00:51:36.969
sorry about that

00:51:36.969 --> 00:51:38.799
yeah California's always in the vanguard

00:51:38.799 --> 00:51:40.900
yeah California basically in the way

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.819
they did it was smarter were like it's

00:51:42.819 --> 00:51:44.529
for cancer patients so everyone was like

00:51:44.529 --> 00:51:45.849
[ __ ] all right we're not gonna say they

00:51:45.849 --> 00:51:47.289
can't have it but then you slide in all

00:51:47.289 --> 00:51:50.169
the backdoor things now you get your

00:51:50.169 --> 00:51:51.699
medical card for chronic pain which is

00:51:51.699 --> 00:51:53.979
like yeah like I have my my foot always

00:51:53.979 --> 00:51:55.959
hurts my back always hurts and it's like

00:51:55.959 --> 00:51:58.179
it's one of those things that like it

00:51:58.179 --> 00:51:59.769
could be nerve pain so you don't

00:51:59.769 --> 00:52:02.589
necessarily need MRIs and x-rays to

00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:04.359
prove it yeah so it's like that kind of

00:52:04.359 --> 00:52:07.479
that that's the exact language for

00:52:07.479 --> 00:52:10.059
marijuana yeah so like in terms of like

00:52:10.059 --> 00:52:12.150
our prescribing guidelines like

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:15.159
initially it was for cancer related pain

00:52:15.159 --> 00:52:19.539
and then EMS related spasticity and then

00:52:19.539 --> 00:52:21.819
it became you know non cancer chronic

00:52:21.819 --> 00:52:23.979
pain and it specifically nerve pain so

00:52:23.979 --> 00:52:25.209
it's interesting that you mentioned that

00:52:25.209 --> 00:52:29.529
yeah so so now I mean now the it's bait

00:52:29.529 --> 00:52:32.140
like we basically have we could we could

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:34.059
basically prescribe it to anyone but

00:52:34.059 --> 00:52:35.499
it's like what the [ __ ] you what do you

00:52:35.499 --> 00:52:37.809
put on a script smoke two joints in the

00:52:37.809 --> 00:52:45.219
morning smoke two joints at night well

00:52:45.219 --> 00:52:47.319
the problem is - in Philly they you know

00:52:47.319 --> 00:52:48.759
they have people who are legitimately

00:52:48.759 --> 00:52:50.919
like like I wanted my medical cards was

00:52:50.919 --> 00:52:52.479
I just use weed for just like my own

00:52:52.479 --> 00:52:53.829
weird reasons but it's like there's

00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:55.449
people who like really need to sleep and

00:52:55.449 --> 00:52:57.219
have cancer and it's like what they do

00:52:57.219 --> 00:52:58.539
is they're just like in the dispensary

00:52:58.539 --> 00:52:59.799
they just give them like [ __ ] there's

00:52:59.799 --> 00:53:02.319
like hash oil it's like 80% like you

00:53:02.319 --> 00:53:03.819
know the RSO and stuff and it's like

00:53:03.819 --> 00:53:06.189
you're gonna like a single-serving will

00:53:06.189 --> 00:53:07.869
be like 100 milligrams it's for anyone

00:53:07.869 --> 00:53:08.859
who hasn't done it before it's gonna

00:53:08.859 --> 00:53:11.349
blow your [ __ ] socks off or you know

00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:13.089
depends on the average person I would

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:14.409
say that would definitely like knock

00:53:14.409 --> 00:53:16.089
them the [ __ ] out and maybe leave a bad

00:53:16.089 --> 00:53:16.630
taste

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:18.670
so it's like yeah but and who's

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:20.860
regulating that like how like how like

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.490
how how do we know that is there

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:26.590
anywhere you like to objectively

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:30.910
determine the milligrams yeah so I know

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:32.890
thank you like weird [ __ ] like like

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:34.960
kahlert colorimetry I think it's called

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.790
or they like they can actually you know

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:39.190
like if you have like an industrial lab

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:41.110
but you said go to something like head

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:45.790
shop that [ __ ] well they know I the

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:47.500
dispensaries here have like the lab

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.000
readouts and all that stuff on there how

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.610
accurate they all right yeah Spencer

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:53.740
ease here have the lab readout and he if

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.150
you're cooking and edibles all you got

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:57.550
to do is like if you're working from you

00:53:57.550 --> 00:53:59.830
know we'd like the flour you can just

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:01.960
assume a very decent it's probably about

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.970
50 you can just say 15 percent freeze

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:07.210
send per gram okay per gram of flour is

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:09.400
150 milligrams of THC and then if you

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.150
have an ounce

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:12.460
times 150 times 28 you're gonna be off

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:14.200
because it might be 12% it might be 20%

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.410
but you'll be in a ballpark but again

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:18.970
how they arrived at that I don't I don't

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:20.110
know that the testing is even that

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:21.760
accurate because I know that the what

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.200
they had a problem here in America where

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.420
they're sending like different edibles

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:26.980
to different labs and they will get a

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:28.060
different readout at three different

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:29.620
labs so yeah you could be right it could

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:32.920
be you know not that reliable but but

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.630
even if you're even if it's not reliable

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:36.340
unlike a milligram image standpoint

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.810
there's still you're gonna hit the

00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:40.300
general zones of like strong light

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.360
medium you know so but yeah yeah it

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.230
still is a problem

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:49.180
it's ballpark yeah what have you been

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:52.720
cooking up lately a new tinctures yeah I

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.020
mean I I do the like I I was ordering

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.180
CBD tankers for a while cuz I just like

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:00.010
them like I got my dad to take them to

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:01.300
cuz he was like taking them for like

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.130
back pain so he's like they helped me

00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:04.420
they helped to help him sleep and I know

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:05.740
another guy who had shoulder pain so I

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:07.660
was ordering the CBD tankers I started

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:10.090
making so I started ordering them then

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:12.130
like dripping the t8 do like THC in them

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:13.840
but really I'm more into making like the

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.280
coconut oil because I like to make like

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.300
gummies and [ __ ] like that

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.900
like little gummies you know your dog

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.240
your dong wack dongbaek's for sure did

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:26.650
you get a nice THC dick going I like

00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:28.210
just making some coconut oil I had this

00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:29.680
I ordered like a

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.530
I would do I ordered a CBD like coconut

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:33.819
oil from one of those like company like

00:55:33.819 --> 00:55:35.589
a good company like Lazarus naturals or

00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:36.910
whatever it's like it you know you read

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:38.410
the lay of lab reports and they like

00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:39.970
tests for heavy metals pesticides all

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:42.010
that stuff and then what I did was I

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:46.300
actually did a [ __ ] what was it and like

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:47.950
an ethanol extraction we're like you

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:49.630
know I did a cold a quick wash it's

00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:51.069
called ADA quiso method or something so

00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:52.450
I did it quick I did a little quick wash

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:53.920
and then you strain that through a

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.140
coffee filter and then you put that into

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:59.319
a rice cooker and then you rice cooker

00:55:59.319 --> 00:56:00.880
boils off the alcohol so you're left

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.950
with basically like the concentrated oil

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:05.440
and then I would take like 2 grams of

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:08.079
that oil which you know say it's 60% so

00:56:08.079 --> 00:56:10.300
it's 600 milligrams per gram so now I

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.859
would take two of those so it's 1,200

00:56:11.859 --> 00:56:13.150
milligrams drop that in a little coconut

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:14.740
jar then you you know mix it up and it's

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:16.960
like a one-to-one CBD THC thing so I

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.460
[ __ ] you know I mess around with stuff

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:26.920
but it's like it's still just

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.809
broken-down crock pots and [ __ ] yeah

00:56:28.809 --> 00:56:31.540
blows I actually did a thing where I

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.670
combined I try to do

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:35.950
glycerin a glycerin tincture but I

00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:37.480
didn't I know like glycerin apparently

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.819
is a bad absorber of THC so I try to

00:56:39.819 --> 00:56:42.430
like mix glycerin and Everclear and it

00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:44.319
like the I don't think it definitely

00:56:44.319 --> 00:56:48.359
like the ever clear wasn't really escape

00:56:48.359 --> 00:56:50.559
no the tincture and it was like I don't

00:56:50.559 --> 00:56:51.760
know if the alcohol whatever the

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.099
whatever alcohol translates into once

00:56:54.099 --> 00:56:56.589
it's hot heated whatever that gas is it

00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:57.670
has to be bad for you because I

00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:59.319
definitely doesn't like smell good it

00:56:59.319 --> 00:57:01.180
smells [ __ ] up but I definitely made

00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:02.920
some kind of threw it all out it smelled

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.000
so bad that I was like I'm not even

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.119
eating this [ __ ] so yeah I would I just

00:57:07.119 --> 00:57:08.589
want this to be legal so people who are

00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:10.540
like not dumb like me can do it and like

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:12.430
no here's how you actually do it oh

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:16.630
thank you right so what about these you

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:18.880
know like you said these different so

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.280
CBD is readily accept but you can get

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:24.099
yeah it's the point now in Pennsylvania

00:57:24.099 --> 00:57:25.660
where like you can just if you all you

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.369
need a farming permit and now you can

00:57:27.369 --> 00:57:29.710
grow just like fields of you know what

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:30.940
they call medicinal hemp which is

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:32.829
literally just weed that's been

00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:34.780
genetically altered to have high CBD low

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:37.030
THC so now you're gonna have it to

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:38.589
people in Pennsylvania who are able to

00:57:38.589 --> 00:57:40.299
just grow hundreds and hundreds of

00:57:40.299 --> 00:57:42.220
plants of which are essentially weed

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:43.420
plants that just have jack

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:47.500
CBD percentages so it's like I might

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.299
write something like that yeah man if

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:50.410
you have the land you get a little

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:51.880
farming permit and then my thing is like

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.410
maybe you throw in a couple of little

00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:54.880
high tasty who the [ __ ] gonna know

00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.019
them dig wow that's a purely genetic

00:57:56.019 --> 00:57:58.359
mutation I did not know that because

00:57:58.359 --> 00:58:00.220
they plan to do mutate their phenotypes

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:01.539
and they do mutate you could like that's

00:58:01.539 --> 00:58:04.660
just an x-man plant dude you guys yeah

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:06.130
and maybe it infected all my other

00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:07.269
plants now they're all like that but

00:58:07.269 --> 00:58:10.569
yeah it's [ __ ] uh and you get a tax

00:58:10.569 --> 00:58:12.670
credit to if you farm so it's kind of

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:17.230
the upside okay yeah man that was nice I

00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:18.760
like that we diverge from the mythology

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:20.769
because I like and this is another thing

00:58:20.769 --> 00:58:21.970
to not this I think is more of a

00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:23.260
personality thing but it's like the

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:25.450
ability to enter into a situation and be

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:26.859
highly open to what it's going to become

00:58:26.859 --> 00:58:28.510
and not trying to control and be like I

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:30.430
want to read mythology because I had I

00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:33.339
was like there's no point on stuff dude

00:58:33.339 --> 00:58:38.130
huh I'm hiring an ever plastic state

00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:40.599
that was nice I was nice to use that as

00:58:40.599 --> 00:58:42.010
a little thing and then a just segue

00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:43.599
into talking which I think was way

00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:45.519
better than just me I'll tell you what

00:58:45.519 --> 00:58:48.480
happened in the story basically the guy

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:51.220
he falls in love with this girl and then

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.410
a lady transforms this girl into a

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:55.720
butterfly and then the butterfly dies

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.579
and is reborn into someone else so he

00:58:57.579 --> 00:58:59.349
basically tricks this other king who

00:58:59.349 --> 00:59:01.029
ends up getting his sniz that he like

00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:03.849
one through I guess like breaking up a

00:59:03.849 --> 00:59:07.170
fight and then he tricks this King into

00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:10.029
it's a long weird story maybe I'll just

00:59:10.029 --> 00:59:11.529
reread it some other time I'm not gonna

00:59:11.529 --> 00:59:15.250
spoil it actually I'll save it but I'm

00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:18.490
glad I'm glad the discussion branched

00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:20.170
off and I also do I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:21.460
write this is another thing I'm talking

00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:23.349
about I'm gonna do that I want to do a

00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:24.910
book and again I want to do like say you

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:26.650
know psychedelics Foursquare's whatever

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:28.599
blah blah blah or but really targeted

00:59:28.599 --> 00:59:33.279
towards I love that title it's a man a

00:59:33.279 --> 00:59:34.750
beginner's guide to the Athena genic

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:38.079
arts but I want to I don't know if I

00:59:38.079 --> 00:59:39.519
should like how old niche it should be a

00:59:39.519 --> 00:59:46.630
little : there definitely throw the

00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:48.339
Cohens gonna be definitely there dudes

00:59:48.339 --> 00:59:50.170
probably a whole different font yeah I

00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:51.099
wondered like I don't know if I want to

00:59:51.099 --> 00:59:53.140
do like it as much more of a like to

00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:54.730
neech it out to where it's like or niche

00:59:54.730 --> 00:59:56.120
after you know say that

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.640
where it's like just like a

00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:01.070
exposure-therapy kind of thing or do I

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:04.430
want to do like a just a general -

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:07.750
general people make it accessible but I

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:13.970
don't know so we'll see yeah yeah well

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:15.230
we're gonna do this again I think what

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:16.490
no it would be nice if we just like

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:18.110
workshop day well I'm gonna cuz I gotta

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:20.180
get rolling right now my [ __ ] I got

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.380
like my family's been calling me and

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.400
I've been ignoring their calls I don't

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.330
wanna interrupt this and they're

01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:26.390
probably like freaking out what we can

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.160
do is I'll just touch back into later

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.990
date and then we can just workshop that

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:31.280
back and forth and it's like I'll just

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.630
hit you with my ideas

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:34.190
hit me with what I'm saying we can even

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:35.660
correspond writing to if you want to do

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.520
that because I mean I will more than

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.260
gladly just will we can just go off of

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:43.490
this thing because I again I mean I you

01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:46.760
know it's it's a project yeah and you

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.190
know it takes obviously you know take

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:54.560
time sure that slowly but surely I do

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.800
not doubt that something reasonable can

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.960
be put together you you got a guy like

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.290
[ __ ] doctor her broadcasting to

01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:06.290
hundreds of thousands of people cannabis

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:08.900
medicine yeah there is a there's an

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:14.200
appetite for a combination of you know

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:18.560
experiential wisdom about psychedelics

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:24.080
with a bit of a bio science flavor I

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.930
mean there's like a they took I think

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:28.370
people exist in like a right now

01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:30.230
especially in like a meaning vacuum or

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:31.700
there's like they don't have they have

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.080
all the material stuff they need and

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.490
it's like yeah Congrats we did that but

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:36.590
now like this people have like there's a

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:37.910
lot of people who complain about having

01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:39.980
like totally meaningless existences and

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.420
I think it's because like you know

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:43.370
religion kind of died for the most part

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:45.740
now like the psychedelics are an easy

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.140
way to still get that religious payoff

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.400
without offending your modern

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.080
sensibilities in a way that's just like

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.270
I think that's good I do I think that's

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:54.800
going to be the wave of that it's going

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.330
to be so big I don't think I think

01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:59.980
people are under estimating it be honest

01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:04.510
[Music]

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:08.350
we'll do this again later much later

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:10.010
right

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:12.070
you
