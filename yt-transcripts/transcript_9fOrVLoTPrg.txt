00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.870
much done school closed that chapter of

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.679
my life and I've been thanking my

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.430
thinking on this for a while now we'll

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.410
see my life pattern traditionally we you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.300
know let's say a couple years ago was I

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.820
was just out here freewheel and I was

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.000
doing I would just I was just constantly

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.689
engaging in a series of disjointed

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.399
efforts that ultimately just all kind of

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.690
went nowhere like I would do one thing

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.280
bored of this and do another thing more

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.410
to that little bit of any turn you know

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.329
[ __ ] 27 years old and you're like

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.730

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.040
what am I even doing that was my that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.059
was my prior life pattern but you know

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.430

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.030
so I was like 31 so now I'm 34 I spent

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.090
the last three years with almost a laser

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.379
focus on how to pull myself out of the

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.379
[ __ ] I was inhabiting the [ __ ]

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.049
dream of an 18 year old at 30 being like

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.950

masters and [ __ ] dumbass Social Work

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.960
the whole point of that is

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.380
integration has been the focus of the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.540
last couple years meaning again now I'm

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.520

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.700
things and be Louisa nothing working

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.930

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.390
stuff for them hence this podcast this

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.940
sub podcast within the patreon entitled

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.770
psyche naw this is my psycho-educational

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.570
podcast where I'll basically take pretty

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.190
much everything I learned from school

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.630
that wasn't total [ __ ]

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.269
I'm gonna go through all those syllabi

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.030
and you see that that's 40 G's that'll

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.350
you'll learn that it's not syllabus is

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.570
it's syllabi I'm gonna screen them for

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.280
stuff that I remember being like oh that

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.570
was cool oh I'm glad I know about this

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.700
glad I know about this condense that off

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.410
so it'll just be you know I have already

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.209
have stuff to talk about now for like

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.850
probably 20-something episodes just from

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.989
that and then there's all the stuff that

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.790
I'm reading on top of that I'm I start

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.160
interviewing experts on all things

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.730
related to improving your lot in life

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.610
not just like make thousand bucks ask me

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.739
how but like again very specifically

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.560
like finding meaning feeling present in

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.010
their own life and just not feeling like

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.410
you're just a helpless you know person

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.510
being cast about the events of what's

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.640
going on around you and or are you a

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.650
person who's like trying to control

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.330
everything around we're gonna talk about

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.420
all that and we are cuz this is the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.410
thing that pisses me off and I told

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.850
myself I wouldn't go on tangents but my

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.070
bed it's like you learn in school you

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.150
learn algebra

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.129
you'll learn biology learn all this [ __ ]

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.530
but at the end of the day what's more

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.299
important than knowing how to inhabit

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.739
your own life in a way that doesn't make

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:45.879
you a want to kill yourself with

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.849
suicides are on the rise even between

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.140
five and eleven year olds the number of

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.939
emergency visits based on suicidal

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.829
ideation have doubled in the last like

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.989
10 years or so so clearly something's

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.299
[ __ ] up we're not we're not [ __ ]

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.250
we're not handling this well you know

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.989
all this progress or whatever we're you

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.220
know for doing so I got to thinking I

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.239
say you know what am I gonna do with

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.810
this time I gonna just tuck tail try to

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.159
save a bunch of money and just retire

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:21.060
and die now bro or am I gonna disrupt

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.440
the idea of traditional therapy it's

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.789
like obviously I'm gonna disrupt

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.010
whatever enterprise I can so here's my

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.349
idea okay psycho educational podcast

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:32.320
just some fun stuff to listen to teach

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.639
people about stuff that they might not

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.020
know about in a way that they can digest

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.030
you know take in whatever no problem

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.460
below that on a subterranean level I'm

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.720
going to start offering a it's gonna be

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.430
free for everyone well not for everybody

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.539
because I can only handle so many people

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.820
at a time but I'm going to offer and

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.710
it'll start small and it'll slowly grow

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.180
if it goes away I plan I'm going to do

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.930
groups of six six or seven people maybe

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.409
eight we'll say it'll be specific it'll

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.449
be I'll figure out group formats and

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:08.860
themes and I'll put them out later of a

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.389
couple of mine but you know I'll wait

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.150
until I have it totally nailed down I'm

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.370
gonna open up like four or five groups a

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.750
week I'll spend about five hours a week

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.150
doing this or I'll have I'll work with

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.960
people free and the reason why I'm gonna

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.580
tell you about you know it's not some

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.050
cloak-and-dagger I want to develop a

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.099
clinically effective peer-led therapy

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.510
modality that is obviously free for the

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.639
dogs while I'm doing it but get this I

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.960
want to figure out a way that people are

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.840
seeing like again like when I say

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.250
clinically relevant I'm just saying like

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.389
you know you do it you take a pretest

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:50.550
there's like the backings

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.220
descale you take that urinate you do six

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.470
weeks you know and you're six weeks of a

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.030
group online therapy thing for free

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.550
again

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.659
now you're down to a four you do it

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:01.740
again you're down to three that means

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.150
that's clinically relevant if you move

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.710
that scale at all it's you know it's

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.139
clinically relevant so once I have that

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.620
nailed down right again follow my steps

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.750
I'm doing the psycho-educational podcast

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.610
I'm teach learning everybody about all

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.319
this stuff

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.610
then I launch the little thing or again

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.800
it's just me and five groups maybe it's

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.659
40 dudes that's that's all we got going

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.090
on we're doing it one time with those

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.569
five groups and I feel like and you know

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:29.310
in the this is everyone this is

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.639
unanimous everyone's like hey Cusk

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.919
pretty good here I think we are now

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.840
self-sustaining unit so what did what

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.909
just happened you took five or six

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:40.860
people who would all have been paying a

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.639
traditional therapist $150 an hour

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.940
separately per week and you take those

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.030
dudes he let them Power Ranger assemble

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.919
and just basically form that therapist

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:55.620
by themselves we can't do though they

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.210
didn't go to school first of all yeah

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.479
they [ __ ] can like if you're you know

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:01.919
if you're gonna be a tightwad about

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.139
[ __ ] that well sorry I forgot that we

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:05.479
actually made that into an actual thing

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:07.969
you know if you're someone who's like

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.469
where's the real get up there's research

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:11.969
saying that peer led therapy groups are

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:13.740
just as effective as a traditional

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.560
therapy they can be they can also be bad

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.819
if you know the person doesn't know what

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:18.509
they're doing but again

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:20.610
psycho-educational podcast all these

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.639
groups are going to be designed and led

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:26.340
in theory and in you know practical

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.490
application by the actual stuff that I

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.990
went to school for which again I could

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.840
right now with one of if they don't give

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.759
me my license whatever but I still

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:38.039
regardless of all that I could go

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:39.840
practice psychotherapy and you know

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.940
start charging people if I wanted to do

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.319
it with it I can take insurance I'd have

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:44.969
to do it for two years but it's like I

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:46.440
don't want to [ __ ] do that I don't

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.669
want to sit in a room I don't feel

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:49.409
comfortable telling someone they have to

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:51.150
pay me $200 an hour for me to listen to

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.340
him that makes me sad it always has I

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.469
went to school for psychology when I was

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:56.940
18 years old and they kind of hit me

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.980
with that and I'm like [ __ ] man

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.110
I can't I can't charge somebody $200 an

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.250
hour to listen to their problems I I

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.400
just I [ __ ] feel badly and look if

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.630
that's what you do for a living I'm not

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.300
calling you like a dick or anything I

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.640
got a big old heart but okay so if

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.560
you're sitting here being like well you

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.990
know you can these people go to school

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.760
and you can't just have six people do it

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.800
again I'm gonna be leading it and then

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.080
once I feel like they're there solid

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.360
it's like hey you guys got this cool I'm

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.430
gonna go get six more people so really

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.670
rather than you know rather than just

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.500
basically crushing people financially

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.810
and the idea that you're like you're

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:40.170
going to find meaning in life the idea

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.090
that you can only again the traditional

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.620
therapy works I've done it I actually

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.180
kind of like it it's just too [ __ ]

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.920
expensive the idea that you can only

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:52.050
find meaning and spark meaningful change

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.350
by paying a dude from like cabrini 150

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.210
bucks an hour or BAE from Bryn Mawr it's

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.100
the I I don't I don't believe it I think

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.840
if you have very severe serious problems

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.510
and yeah like go get the insurance go do

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.120
the stuff if you're just a standard dude

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.440
kicking around who you like you know

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.670
your life doesn't feel like it's very

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.960
meaningful you feel out of touch with

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.400
yourself only innate it from your

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.470
relationship level ba Dada all my

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.850
opinion can be handled by a group so

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.720
okay you're still like you can't do them

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.790
you need the experts this look this is

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.290
the Atlantic this is the cover story the

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.330
anxious child it's about how anxieties

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.000
on the rise in children again all those

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.500
stats was talking about the suicide come

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.970
from this but they talk about like the

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.550
answer to this this are like what are we

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.690
gonna do all of these kids all these

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.550
kids are anxious all these kids at OCD

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.610
their kids are killing themselves or

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.790
trying to at least the answer to that

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.430
comes from Yale it's in this book or in

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.850
this it's in this issue so

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.680
called let me see it's called space

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.819
right you see where this thing is sorry

00:10:00.819 --> 00:10:04.050
should have this prepared

00:10:05.819 --> 00:10:08.889
do-do-do-do-do-do okay a highly

00:10:08.889 --> 00:10:10.660
promising new treatment out of Yale

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.730
University's Child Study Center called

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.250
space supportive parenting for anxious

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.560
childhood emotions takes a different

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.449
approach so saying like kids are being

00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:21.009
overly coddled and maybe that's why

00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:24.639
they're super anxious which ya know shed

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:28.149
so Yale came up with this this thing

00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:29.529
again you're you're like I don't know to

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:32.019
do my family's all messed up I need an

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:35.589
expert yells best and brightest it's you

00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:37.329
a space got a cool acronym you go

00:10:37.329 --> 00:10:38.709
someone's sitting there they got degrees

00:10:38.709 --> 00:10:41.610
on their wall and so here's here's the

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.380
core message between space the

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.870
intervention so the guy who started that

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.750
his name okay said space is predicated

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.610
on the simple idea that you can combat a

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.860
kid's anxiety disorder by reducing

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.230
parental accommodation basically those

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.940
things a parent does to alleviate a

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.220
child's anxious feelings if a child is

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.230
afraid of dogs accommodation might be

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.970
walking her across the street so as to

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.009
avoid one if a child is scared of the

00:11:06.009 --> 00:11:07.720
dark it might be letting him sleep in

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.620
your bed so basically what Yale figured

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.660
out is that you can't give your kid

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.040
their way all the time otherwise it

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.730
relation it [ __ ] them up basically if

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.240
you if you give your kid their way

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.769
they're godly the world's not going to

00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:24.850
it's going to psych them out it's gonna

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.110
cause some anxiety because I'm never

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.540
gonna have to confront stuff and grow

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.310
that's the experts are just repurposing

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.380
folk wisdom again I'm not saying like

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.480
the whole thing's [ __ ] teardown but

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.630
it's like this isn't [ __ ] rocket

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.389
science man it's just people need to

00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:43.240
relate to other people they need to talk

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.920
things out they need people listen they

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.449
need people to listen and feed stuff

00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:48.730
back to them you don't need a [ __ ]

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.970
PhD is it helpful is it awesome these

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.949
guys do research yeah it's great and

00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:55.240
guess what they're not gonna [ __ ]

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.100
stop and guess what I can read the

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.290
research and guess what I can have these

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.420
guys talk about it like this isn't a big

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.170
secret

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.290
so like the fact that I

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.779
I said on if I said this it's like 56%

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:10.240
of people who identify as having a

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.130
mental disorder which again I'll talk

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.509
about the medical model which I'm not a

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:15.100
big fan of in terms of mental health but

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.160
regardless 56 percent of people don't

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.899
they can't get help because it's too

00:12:19.899 --> 00:12:24.430
[ __ ] expensive so here here's my

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.620
pitch do some groups get the dogs going

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.029
once the group becomes so you know once

00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:32.589
the everybody feels like hey this is

00:12:32.589 --> 00:12:35.620
cool this is great you guys can keep

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.720
doing this here's a zoom login you can

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.730
actually start your own on free now you

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.410
get five dudes you guys once a week or

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.480
two shooting the [ __ ] figuring stuff out

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.370
I mean I can't think of how that you

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.509
know if you don't like that fine don't

00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:48.430
do that go the options you know you can

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.740
go do it up you want I just think that

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.910
is a good thing to be there for people

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.769
and then eventually eventually

00:12:53.769 --> 00:12:55.569
eventually down the line so not you know

00:12:55.569 --> 00:12:56.829
I would just be starting groups getting

00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:57.819
them to the point where they're stable

00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:58.839
and like alright you guys are off the

00:12:58.839 --> 00:13:00.459
new group until I feel like I have

00:13:00.459 --> 00:13:02.649
enough proof that this thing is

00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:06.370
clinically effective and from there is

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.480
where things get cool

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.430
I would then start to do it where I

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.709
would advertise this as like a kind of

00:13:11.709 --> 00:13:14.079
like a separate service where and I

00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:15.310
don't know price points yet but I would

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.930
figure it out something super like crazy

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.350
affordable where it's like you know five

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.360
to ten bucks a session for people again

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.370
the programs are down tight everybody's

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.519
doing it and this is where I think it's

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:28.569
kinda neat because the other one there's

00:13:28.569 --> 00:13:30.339
one called Live Well that is just for

00:13:30.339 --> 00:13:32.589
depression the lady I went to school

00:13:32.589 --> 00:13:35.050
with started it really nice lady and she

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.730
does this but it's just depression

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.560
that's all you can do and it's all free

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.569
so you know go check it out to live well

00:13:40.569 --> 00:13:42.579
I think this Google live well depression

00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:44.470
it'll pop up if you can do it like now

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.420
you can go do what I'm talking about

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.910
right now but only for depression mine's

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:52.449
gonna be more for it's gonna be a kind

00:13:52.449 --> 00:13:55.480
of ferried so it'll be like anxiety

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.209
relationship issues then I'll be having

00:13:58.209 --> 00:14:00.850
ones that are also more of like very

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.790
specific ways to kind of reintegrate

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.529
yourself so one of them's one of the

00:14:05.529 --> 00:14:06.430
things I'm definitely gonna do is

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.709
dissociation and how people can kind of

00:14:08.709 --> 00:14:09.759
get cut off from the lives but again

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:10.990
this is just this is just the

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.130
introduction I'm not gonna get ahead of

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.529
myself told myself I wouldn't so you

00:14:14.529 --> 00:14:16.209
know go check out live well that's free

00:14:16.209 --> 00:14:17.740
that's a free idea so you can see what

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.360
I'm talking about

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.700
but this is going to be again a little

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.340
more this is gonna be you know rough cut

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.900
denim or something for the dogs dude

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.110
because again a lot of the when I was in

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.020
school and people would talk about this

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.180
kind of stuff my antennas go off for

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.000
people were like then I went to my job

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.360
and found out I didn't get a promotion

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.760
and I needed four days off because I was

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.070
sad and like dude I'm like shut the [ __ ]

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.990
up you know so it's like what you can't

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.160
in that kind of space you can't do that

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.300
at all so I want to start something

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.240
that's a little more you know a little

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.100
more tailored for just dogs dogs you

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.630
know right now the bass I can't have

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.010
them in this is just gonna be dogs I'm

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.230
gonna keep everything very specific but

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.960
stuff that's not like offensively [ __ ]

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.250
ish if that makes sense there's a lot of

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.630
people are turned off to therapy because

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.920
they think it's gay or they're like oh

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.950
it's for good stuff you know that the

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.720
traditional course is you know do a

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.120
young man who's [ __ ] good I'm not

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.560
[ __ ] doing that and then obviously

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.150
they still have a bunch of problems and

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.350
then they started doing the ton of like

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.940
oxys or coke and then crashed their car

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.130
into a [ __ ] bar then they're like and

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.270
then they'll eventually get help now

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.920
that they've you know done some

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.380
elaborate show of like almost dying or

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.530
like alright now I'm ready for whatever

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.480
you can skip all that [ __ ] and that's

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.120
what I want to try to bring to people so

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.020
once this thing's stable once it's

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.610
running I want to try to figure out a

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.200
way to do it so it's totally sustainable

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.420
because you know it's leaves me two

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.380
options you know live well they just

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.820
they went and got grants so like people

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.920
will pay a couple people to run it and

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.690
it's all volunteer Run which that's

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.270
awesome that's not my mo though I'm a

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.040
money man don't get me don't get it

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.990
twisted bro classic British liberal

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.470
classic black black conservative I'm

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.200
about cans and globs but I'm also about

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.560
getting wops in a way that isn't like

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.000
forceful and you know just like again

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.440
$150 an hour that's ridiculous how about

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.780
everyone who coughs up you get a group

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.740
of you know 10 dudes chalking up I don't

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.170
know 5 to 10 bucks or it's just one of

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.730
those suggested donation things between

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.290
5 and 10 dollars and if you can't pay

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:30.070
anything whatever but here's the catch

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.420
so as these groups are going and people

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.500
get interested like hey I kind of like

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.150
doing this you know I'm a plumber I'm an

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.960
electrician I work in a paint shop I

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.130
really like you know when I come home on

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:40.720
the weekends doing my group I think I

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.450
could handle a group of newbies here's

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.130
how the model works out all right

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.110
psycho-educational podcast I've been

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.790
talking I've been doing this now I have

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.050
a curriculum I have a training

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.450
curriculum for anybody who wants to be

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.760
what's called a paraprofessional or a

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.630
lay counselor

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.310
within you know this umbrella that I'm

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.420
starting you take the course again maybe

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.860
it's free maybe it's a couple hundred

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.690
bucks maybe it's free and then it's like

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.040
you know cut me a little bit when you're

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.350
done but none of this is gonna be like

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.390
crazy vampiric or extortionary this will

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.940
all be affordable for the user while

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.310
also worth a person's time who wants to

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:18.339
do that for extra money so if you can

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.750
kind of catch my drift it would be like

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.060
if you like doing this you sign up you

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.949
take a little course just so I make sure

00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:25.570
I'm not sending psychos into groups

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:28.420
being like aw dude [ __ ] you should

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.220
you should totally beat your step kid

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.510
you know you gotta show him who's the

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.370
Matt no like I want to make sure these

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.620
people aren't [ __ ] psychos but once

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.540
people go through a course iife like re

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.890
this person's got it this person has an

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.700
innate the innate personality that does

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.860
well with I think this is more of a

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.180
personality thing than a knowledge thing

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.350
in terms of being able to listen and

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.670
being able to kind of like hear both

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.830
sides and you know be empathetic and

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.750
open yourself up that's more of a

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.070
personality trait I think than any

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.290
degree you can get yeah that's my

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.080
heartache I'll stand by that so the idea

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.270
would be to train lay professionals to

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.540
then offer a mode of therapy that is I

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.600
mean dude again free for people that

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.040
can't afford it if you can't afford it

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.680
you know truck five to ten bucks and for

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.450
like again like guy who was just working

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.190
a normal job you can come home and do a

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.680
thing for extra money on the side in

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.100
terms of like helping other people maybe

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.570
it's just younger dues maybe it's people

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.790
your age kind of get a bitter better

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.180
grip on their life while using the same

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.820
stuff and theory that somebody with a

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.430
PhD would I know it's kind of long and

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:34.870
rambling but that's the basic idea

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.140
that's what I'm gonna be launching and I

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.610
do want feedback if this sounds

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.640

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.800
gonna do it anyway

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.170
I just it's too good of an idea it's not

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.790
even that original of an idea be like if

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.080

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.390
