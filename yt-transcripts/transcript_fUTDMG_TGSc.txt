of the lineup yes she said it's i

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.639

i could definitely i wanted to be tough

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.440
now we're on an important issue lineup

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.240
of similar penises

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.880
i could spot remotely similar things

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.400
yeah could you pick it out

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.720
that's a good question i might start

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.560
like an rv tournament version of just

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.919

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.639
tennis on earth

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.080
i've read i've read o'connor talking

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.240
about that what was he saying he said

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.639
the

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.560
peloton teenis is unrivaled when do you

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.680
say that twitter

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.280
that little [ __ ] did he steal you he

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.360
wrote my [ __ ] peloton once

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.919
that little weasel so he thinks he has

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.039
the audacity to say

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.120
he shriveled his penis more than you no

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.039
but he was the so i've had this peloton

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.320

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.880
chicks

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.720

peloton with me yeah

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.280
so i i o'connor got a pair of shoes for

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.039
himself so he could use mine

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.639
and the first time he got off we

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.440
commiserated on tinus i haven't had

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.720
the teenage discussion with anybody

taking in some news and it's like

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.600
especially when you read the debt book

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.600
we are absolutely being like

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.199

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.959
as a nation this is what i this is like

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.880
the snippet i got from the atlantic

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.280
we should be looking to heal we should

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.319
be looking to heal

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.799
but we have to have riot sympathizers

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:16.319
answer for what they did

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.520
and i'm strictly talking about people

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.919
who stormed the capitol yes

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:21.600
nothing else happened in the summer

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.959
strictly talking about it's just not

even mentioned they call the people who

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.079
storm the capital riot sympathizers

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.559
and while biden wants to unify america

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:30.080
because right now it's just

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.760
abysmal terms of how we're relating to

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.240
each other we shouldn't right now

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.320
we need they're basically saying like we

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.480

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.760
some someone at least and there's

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.520
calling for a show of force

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.880

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.960

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.679
really yeah he took him out back and

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:38.159
like

00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:40.320
beat his ass what yeah he was doing

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.200
moves

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.600
yeah you can't do that he moves to like

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.039
a drunk college kid that was

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:47.840
like just loud oh yeah i mean that's

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.279
also the perfect job

00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:51.760
the guy when i was doing jiu jitsu he

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.320
like

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.720
saved the funds for his jujitsu studio

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.840
by bouncing

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.000
so he was just like full-on like boxing

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.279
and training and he would just

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:01.760
[ __ ] people up like constantly and then

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.200
like he finally got enough money from

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.559
[ __ ] up drunk people to open up his

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:05.440
own studio

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.960
that's the journey i think it's a fair i

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.559
think it's a fair deal

00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:10.159
we should we should let bouncers go a

00:29:10.159 --> 00:29:11.600
little we should give them like a little

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.399
more

00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:13.840
respect definitely lethal force we

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.360
should give them lethal force for sure

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.039
i think so i think if somebody if you

00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:20.720
drink too much the bouncer it should be

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.600
allowed

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.120
it's it's like international water kind

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.480
of stuff but it can kill you he's not

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.919
going to obviously we're going to try to

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:27.039
not have that happen but

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:29.360
in a scuffle if you die it's just going

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.399
to be

00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:31.840
the bar owner gets to look into it be

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.840
like no you just buy the book

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.240

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.600
brothers dudes

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.880

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.240
wall at the bottom of the steps

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.000
because it was like the side of the bar

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.559
downstairs head first

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:12.000
just while i was standing it was like a

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.600
wednesday night oh

00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:36.799
here who are you mister

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.279

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.919
[ __ ] it's great and it was next to me

00:32:55.919 --> 00:32:57.039
and i was just standing there

00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:58.720
and the rest of the bar was pretty empty

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.159
all of a sudden this dude flew down the

00:33:00.159 --> 00:33:01.200
steps and like

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.159
it was so loud i was just like holy [ __ ]

00:33:04.159 --> 00:33:06.399
that guy just died

00:33:06.399 --> 00:33:08.320
but i didn't care it was weird i didn't

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.919
like there was no part of me that was

00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:11.200
worried well you were in [ __ ]

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.799
i was literally just looking at a guy

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:15.279
that just died and i was like

00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:17.120
somebody we got called that's all i did

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.240
you should have [ __ ] held him down

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:18.960
just

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.279
put my knee in his back stop resisting

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:25.120
that type of behavior is unacceptable

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.159
you can't die in here

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.880
it is funny that like for some reason

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.360
bars get to hire their own like weird

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.679
low-age private security it's kind of a

00:33:35.679 --> 00:33:37.279
it just gives you a glimpse into like

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:38.960
the world of alcohol and the effects of

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.320
it anywhere like

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.600
you don't need bouncers anywhere else

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.360
and like drinking establishments

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.120
of course you need to hire a dude who

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.399
can like kick somebody's ass

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:48.799
it's like a someone who it would be

00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:50.080
believable to look at them they could

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.679
kick everyone's ass in the establishment

00:33:51.679 --> 00:33:52.080
yeah

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.360
in order to have a bar you also need

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.360
like a strong dude yeah you just need

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.559
big guys

00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:57.840
because that's the only thing if you're

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.200

what by the rwandan government yeah dude

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.440

hollywood didn't tell the whole ethiopia

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.640

you're [ __ ] just like the jacking off

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.000
was just thinking about it

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.960
treacherous behavior

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.480
[ __ ] flashbacks and jerking off

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.839
obviously

00:57:51.839 --> 00:57:55.839
yeah everybody remembers it

00:57:59.359 --> 00:58:00.960
so you can't control your arm your arm

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:02.880
is the problem once that thing gets

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.160
going you might have jerked off right

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.040
here

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.119
all right but just to answer this you're

00:58:07.119 --> 00:58:08.319
kind of dancing around this so you jerk

00:58:08.319 --> 00:58:09.760
off for one hour and you ju

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:12.720
you you finish once per hour finish once

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.480
okay i finished once per hour once

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.640
and then um i'll stop i watch something

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.079
else and i'll be like

00:58:18.079 --> 00:58:19.760
i don't think i saw the video i liked

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.440
and i'll just go run it back go back for

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.160
another hour

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.000
yeah so now you're looking at two hours

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.079
possibly a day like an hour and a half

00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:27.839
two hours so to put it in perspective

00:58:27.839 --> 00:58:29.520
you jerked off for two hours a day for

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.280
how long

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.799
because dude this is the craziest [ __ ]

00:58:32.799 --> 00:58:34.799
i've i should do this dude i should

00:58:34.799 --> 00:58:37.200
do long fast i wouldn't do well the

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.880
second one i would try to be like let me

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.240
run that back but i would do more of a

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.200
quicker one

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.400
but there's there's like a kind of a

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.400
weird delight and ripping the second one

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:47.040
yeah [ __ ] coming against me awesome i

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.079
used to sit there and just

00:58:48.079 --> 00:58:49.839
dude i'll be like i'm gonna jerk off and

00:58:49.839 --> 00:58:52.240
then take a nap and i would just do

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.400
45 minutes to an hour just like not that

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.559
one not that one not that one

00:58:56.559 --> 00:58:58.559
dude trying to get the searching but are

00:58:58.559 --> 00:58:59.920
you going at it while you're here i'm

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.359
[ __ ] i'm just like kind of fapping

00:59:01.359 --> 00:59:02.559
quietly and then like

00:59:02.559 --> 00:59:04.079
if i would start to build myself up to

00:59:04.079 --> 00:59:05.359
the point where i'm about to bust my nut

00:59:05.359 --> 00:59:07.119
i would like slow it down brother

00:59:07.119 --> 00:59:09.760
really yeah

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:13.280
saint juan second one because there's

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.559
nothing worse than when you're fapping

00:59:14.559 --> 00:59:16.040
and then you just like

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:19.040
blankly

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.400
but then if you're fapping and you come

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.240
to like an unexciting video and you like

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:24.960
kind of just

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.640
blankly come you're like it's like

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:32.400
it sucks man yeah dude

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.880
i mean you're trying to fill a void dude

00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:35.599
you're trying to full

00:59:35.599 --> 00:59:38.400

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.119
feel that way

00:59:39.119 --> 00:59:41.119
you don't if you don't have the void i

00:59:41.119 --> 00:59:43.040
just you're you have you have something

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.799
of a pure middle value system dude five

00:59:44.799 --> 00:59:46.319
minutes you got the [ __ ] you got your

00:59:46.319 --> 00:59:47.359
eye on the before bed

00:59:47.359 --> 00:59:48.880
you get your eye on the prize dude if

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:50.079
you don't have your eye on the prize you

00:59:50.079 --> 00:59:51.119
start to [ __ ]

00:59:51.119 --> 00:59:53.440
you start to just be like just while i'm

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.200
reading about peleliu

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.720

00:59:58.839 --> 01:00:01.839
bad

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.440
uh so you're ripping you're jerking off

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.480
two hours a day

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.000

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.839
this

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:12.079
a while how long would you say maybe

01:00:12.079 --> 01:00:14.079
like most of your adult life

01:00:14.079 --> 01:00:16.000
yeah not most like okay because

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.200
sometimes i'd stop

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.520
again

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.160
it's off and on i'm sorry i'm not trying

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.599
to make you look better feel better i'm

01:00:23.599 --> 01:00:25.359
just yeah

01:00:25.359 --> 01:00:26.799
i guess well just to put it this is a

01:00:26.799 --> 01:00:27.920
perspective i'd like to put it in

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.480
lemaire and

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.480
you know when you think about this when

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.920
while you're jerking off in an hour and

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.359
a half to two hours you know again which

01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:34.240
i used to do

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.599
just think there's a person out there

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:37.599
who's enduring like an hour and a half

01:00:37.599 --> 01:00:39.680
commute back and forth from work

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.799
it's a weird way to think there's a guy

01:00:40.799 --> 01:00:42.319
in his car just gripping the wheels just

01:00:42.319 --> 01:00:43.599
jerking off and you're just [ __ ]

01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:45.359
you're just in a [ __ ] screen just

01:00:45.359 --> 01:00:47.119
jerking off on a septa that's what he's

01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:48.640
doing in between work

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.720

he's white knuckles lash me sing

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.480

entire commute you're just like that's a

01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:04.319

01:11:48.239 --> 01:11:49.760
t porn is the sign of when you're

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.840

more soldiers out there who are just

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.239

01:12:08.239 --> 01:12:10.080
any time when you and me talked about it

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.679
on the but when you confessed to it i

01:12:11.679 --> 01:12:13.600
first off i had never even imagined it

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.760
yeah dude i couldn't believe it but as

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.840

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.040
we knew came out was like [ __ ] come

are you gay that was funny well it's

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.120
funny because it really

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.800
should not be a big deal it really

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.679
shouldn't if we're like you know

01:12:31.679 --> 01:12:33.040
everyone's moving forward we're doing

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.400
all new stuff

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.480
you know it's not a huge deal i'll say

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.760
this is the thing though

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:42.400
i'm telling you dude i'm telling you

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.920
it should be something that i just moved

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.440
past however

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.520
as soon as i kind of like got my ducks

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.560
in a row

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.239
it just lost all of its allure dude i'm

01:12:50.239 --> 01:12:51.600
telling you it was the phallic mother

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.120
i think i was bowing before the phallic

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.320
mother and as soon as i [ __ ]

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.920
integrated myself fully

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.199
well not fully obviously like three

01:12:57.199 --> 01:12:59.280
quarters of the way yeah i've like

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.199
pulled it up and just been like

01:13:01.199 --> 01:13:03.760
ugh yeah same thing well that's how it

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.800
always should have been it should have

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.600
always been like oh

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.199
that's what i'm saying dude yeah but if

01:13:07.199 --> 01:13:08.560
you're out if you're in if you're in the

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.960
existential vacuum dude if you're adrift

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.960
the [ __ ] sirens dude the dong sirens

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.280
are calling

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:19.840
the ladies playership over here

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:20.960
you're all right there's nothing wrong

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.239
with it you're exactly right no i'm

01:13:22.239 --> 01:13:23.760
telling you i think it should be uh

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.520
you know i think we have bigger fish to

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.280
fry as a species

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.280
right now but i will say it's one of

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.800
those things that i think if like if

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.080
you're watching it being like why am i

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.440
watching this it's like

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.400
you should probably start like

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.920
definitely examining some things yeah i

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.280
think if you were doing it and feeling

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.239
guilty i don't know

01:13:38.239 --> 01:13:40.320
if i watched porn and felt guilty after

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.760
or like something then i'd be like

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.120
this is bad because i'm usually very

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.880
easy to feel guilty about

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.600
almost anything i do like if you watch

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.239
it your daddy's

01:13:48.239 --> 01:13:51.840
like dude 100

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.679
like there's nothing to it to me yeah i

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:55.440
don't know i put no stock in it at all

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.960
that's good if i don't do it i just

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.640
forgot yeah that's all

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.480
it's all to do this it's just like

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.080
something oh yeah she took off

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.239

you know you can't be running on too hot

01:14:08.239 --> 01:14:09.679
all the time but i will say

01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:10.960
in a relationship you can get to the

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.080
point where you start to get kind of

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.040
