00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.579
that it can do yeah really why well no

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.600

like I know I get it but oh yeah but I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.960
don't I don't hate on their phone

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.879
because it's like if I was Indian I'd be

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:03.899
doing the same

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.880
thing you know if an Indian was beside

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.460
me I'd be all up in their face well

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.900
that's you're that's the thing you're

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.640

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.020
Ireland shake the head yeah and make fun

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.979
you want yeah it's tough now because we

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.259
didn't have immigrants forever so we

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.700
were all just like yeah we love black

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.780
people and stuff like that and then we

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.220
just let a load of them in I know

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.200
there's a lot of race Wars going on so

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.060
it's like for years it was like for

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.619
years we're like no there's no racism

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.700
here it's like there's no one to be

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.860
racist against yeah and now it turns out

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.420
yeah we've got you guys are capable of

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.340
it we've got some underlining problems I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.399
guess the guys who the guys who came

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.680
over should have told you guys

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.420
you know all the Irish people that came

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.460
to America yeah they came back like oh

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.640
we're very capable of it

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.560
you wouldn't believe the the street

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.060
behaved the racism where are you getting

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.619
immigrants from

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.340
um it's like New Jersey yeah yeah

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.420
there's a lot of Mexicans come over

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.759
really no no that's what they say dude

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.280
that's a bad that's the Battle Royale if

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.959
the lads and the Irish linked up they're

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.300
they're linked dude Genetically speaking

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.620
I really think dude we were talking

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.260
about the mythology and the mine tail

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.599
there's a uh cooling or whatever there

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.959
is a kahulan in Maya or in the mines so

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.879
I think they're the same people yeah I

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.980
think Mexicans Irish people are it's the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.680
same they're very similar yeah yeah just

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.739
sort of working drinking yep making

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.200
loving God just love like Catholicism

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.300
fat jokes and stuff farts yeah

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.580
if you if I only got away from Mexicans

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.379
dude yeah it would become the greatest

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.760
nation on Earth

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.280
they would get so hammered sure would be

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.660
a lot of fights too they're the two most

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.080
fighting people yeah lost ABS dude

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.480
Spanish fighter what's that like

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.580
Mexicans do they fight a lot yeah dude I

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.900
didn't do the Spanish yeah I didn't know

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.940
that oh or do you mean the Mexicans

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.319
I'm talking about the same people here

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.959
oh okay do you you mean I thought you

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.760
were asking about Spain Mexicans

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.700
Mexicans love to fight do they if you go

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.440
if I remember reading a book because I

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.480
was I was going to go to Mexico and uh

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.800
it was like a tourist book and they're

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.019
saying like fist fights are very common

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.300
that fist fights are like whatever

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.200
stabbings when people are like whoa whoa

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.180
break it up it's like a fist fight it's

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.099
like whatever but yeah if you're really

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.019
pissed your boss had a knife yeah God

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.640
told me that exact same thing in Spain

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.640
really yeah like verbatim about myself

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.340
about Spain like they'll fight and then

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.739
you will someone will stab if they're

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.319
Dishonored enough it's usually like

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.720
you're allowed to like slap for some

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.360
reason yeah

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.340
slapping is like a common like way to

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.200
settle a dispute if you go close fists

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.180
that's considered like you're trying to

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.220
fight and you're allowed to stab now

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.019
wait are you allowed to physically slap

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.819
in Spain I think so you have a license

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.599
to slap yes

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.180
well it depends it depends what the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.099
offense was I could I expecting like my

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.620
honor just a slap him just to settle it

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.360
real quick that's a slapping right no

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.760
that's a back oh yeah but if it's

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.459
perhaps mocking one of my lovers yeah

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.739
how dare you yeah I would honestly

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.540
believe if someone told me Spain allows

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.459
slapping I'd be like I I believe that

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.840
yeah

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.540
most likely I think they can yeah we

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.400
gotta bring that we need to allow slaps

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.500
dude slapping is genuinely it's pretty

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.720
harmless it's just kind of like a

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.580
like it's a it's like a rattlesnake dude

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.780
it's like yeah it's a little rattle on

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.040
the tail but I'll [ __ ] slap you

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.660

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.400

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.419
Johnny Cage he was like hammer and he

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.240
saw me what it was out it wasn't like

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.979
fun it was like almost out of aggression

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.300
wow and I slapped him and he's like

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.220
he got hammered and then everybody held

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.720
him back after he tried to assault me

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.340
but you were in your legal right I was

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.720
leaving you were defending your penis

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.460
yeah you're within you I was absolutely

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.919
it's one of the Spanish Worlds the fan

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.400
your penis at all that's how all duel

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.780
started how did the Irish feel about the

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.340
Spanish

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.900
um we liked our country we don't

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.120
necessarily like them why not I like it

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.580
you do yeah like I think maybe because

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.039
you could speak Spanish oh you don't

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.810
like him because different languages

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.520
[Laughter]

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.500
not even my language you better learn it

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.539
yeah it's funny you're saying there's no

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.820
like problem with racism in Ireland I

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.919
was doing an open mic at Fergie's and

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.000
they remember that were you there that

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.220
night there was a Irish couple

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.800
yeah I believe so so the one guy came

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.600
over and was just like I was talking to

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.520
Sydney Gantt and he walked over he's

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.199
like watch out that guy will steal your

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.419
shoes

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.479
what yeah he heard about it he heard

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.639
about it steal your shoes that's nice I

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.380
feel like it got like almost less

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.780
hurtful because he added your shoes if

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.340
he had just said that guy's on a steal

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.600
yeah come on dude but he's like your

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.979
shoes you're like that's what you this

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:12.600
guy is kind of a jolly he's not he's not

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.919
taking anything else just take your

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.120
sneakers out yeah like a mythical

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.580
villain yes yes like a reverse Saint

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.819
Nick

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.919
so Ireland's pretty racist they're not

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.539
liking the immigrants I don't I don't

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.220
know to be fair I think in any country

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.780
there's a bunch of people who don't like

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.940
immigrants yeah something you're born I

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.560
think it's like a thing you it's like

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.819
when dudes from a different School come

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:38.340
to your party yeah yeah it's instinctive

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.800
it's it's in there no matter what if

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.120
your ass somewhere and someone else

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.740
shows up you're like get the [ __ ] out of

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.180
here I'm telling you I think it's I

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.740
think it's just a personality thing I

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.000
think there's just a personality type

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.800
who just goes there's huh

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.259
do we know them yeah from another to get

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:53.819
them the [ __ ] out of here I I swear to

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:55.380
God I think it's just I floated this at

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.639
Bryn Mawr I was like I think it's more

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:57.780
just a personality issue and they're

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.660
like you can't let that off the hook

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.680
some people just

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.780
don't like people that you know it's a

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.400
type c Personality yeah they don't know

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.780
what they're up to and they go where are

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.039

pretty heavily focused on the

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.099
negative aspects of George Washington's

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:46.080

00:08:52.019 --> 00:08:53.279
I'm just gonna ruin it for me when I

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:54.480

like one of the last true scientists but

00:12:35.579 --> 00:12:37.920
he uh he's just a scientist dude he

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.120
[ __ ] rules he thinks his son's

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.200
conscious

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.959
so he has some good proof so he's wrong

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:44.700
he thinks this one so he's going wrong

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.100
the person the son could be he just

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.260
wants to open the discussion like like

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.200
Teletubbies or something

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.139
this is why they used to execute people

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:57.620
I wish your church was still yeah

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.180
cut this guy's [ __ ] head off dude I

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.800
mean crucifix right now the whole this

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.060
whole thing you guys have going on of

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.519
like mechanistic materialism it comes

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:07.200
from all right ancient how many times

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.899
did you repeat that on the drive over

00:13:08.899 --> 00:13:11.899
here

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:13.860
as it was coming out I was like it was

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.360
like a turd coming out did I get the

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.639
whole thing out here hit that 30 second

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:19.700
rewind on the audible

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.620
but no he said he was like dude I

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.700
watched one of his talks he's talking

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.779
about the science delusion he's not

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:26.160
against science so he was saying a lot

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.839
of it got hung up on Dogma now where he

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:30.420
was like a lot of their

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.740
um a lot of the stuff they just kind of

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.260
assume is based on just like old

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.820
religious stuff like the universe is

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.860
infinite like these Waterloo cans could

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.639
be

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:40.740
no no this has to be a self-organizing

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.360
system oh sun is actually a

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.399
self-organizing system yeah um these

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:46.079
yeah this this would be water inside of

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:48.600
it though very possible yes yeah very

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.279
possible he was his idea and he's like I

00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:51.600
just want to talk about it dude he was

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.880
like you know the whole he was like

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.639
coming up with all the main uh like

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:58.380
foundational beliefs of Science of like

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.600
you know Energy's never created he was

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.279
like looked into it he's like I don't

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:03.779
know if that's true because they just

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:06.480
added like 25 million percent of dark

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.940
matter and dark energy out of nowhere so

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.620
he's like well what was that you know so

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.060
he you know he's pretty good he was

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.380
talking about the uh how the speed of

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.720
light changed as well he's like that

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.100
changed like three or four times in

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.139
physics all around the world different

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:21.360
physicists came up with different speeds

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.620
of light around the same time and then

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.940
it would settle back to another one he

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.079
asked the guy about it the guy was like

00:14:25.079 --> 00:14:26.279
that was that's just a fluke that's

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:27.779
weird I don't know if it would be a

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:28.560
fluke wouldn't it just be

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.899
miscalculations no because a bunch of

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:32.279
people around the world got it and then

00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:33.240
they'd be like no we're getting this now

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.980
like all right we'll just change it so

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.779
they've changed the thing for the speed

00:14:36.779 --> 00:14:38.459
of light a bunch of times and then you

00:14:38.459 --> 00:14:40.740
know at least several times and then the

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.839
physicists are just like we don't think

00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:45.959
about that yeah so but he's all he wants

00:14:45.959 --> 00:14:47.699
to say is like you know maybe [ __ ]

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:48.899
matters conscious if we're made of

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:50.880
matter and we're conscious why you know

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.399
maybe other stuff is too so

00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:55.260
maybe the sun's conscious dude maybe

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.480
each star is like a little cell

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.880
so pretty cool yeah I'm into that from

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.399
my cells are unconscious

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:05.699
they comprise the whole idea was like I

00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:07.260
guess you'd have to define consciousness

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.600
that's all he wants to do dude know what

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.160
he said you know you know you guys

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.500
double M's can't haven't done it yet

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.600
oh hi mighty oh we don't have sleeps

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.399
why'd you call us double lamps

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:20.760
mechanistic yeah

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.320
did you try to skip that word again

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.940
it's a good word you deserve it yeah

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.620

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.000
him but you can certainly

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.500
I feel like you could get in yeah yeah

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.799
you would be you would stand out in high

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.980
school

00:20:38.059 --> 00:20:40.799

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.000
alone

00:20:56.419 --> 00:20:59.760
so here's here's where this tale of my

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.679
visit to Mount Vernon takes a harrowing

00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:02.760
turn

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.640
so I I a lot of slave talk on this tour

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.559
so I want to check out where the slaves

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:08.820
lived you should have confronted them

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.080
immediately about it they wear this

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.380
please please they it was one they took

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.640
us to the kitchen

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.919
George Washington's kitchen which had

00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:19.679
two slaves working at all times same two

00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:22.880
and they worked 4 AM to 9 pm every day

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.760
in a kitchen 4 a.m to 9 p.m yes okay I

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.659
don't know how they got well I guess

00:21:27.659 --> 00:21:29.760
they have ledgers and [ __ ] uh oh yeah

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.960
they definitely knew and then the lady

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.820
was like and this was their refrigerator

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.440
which was just like a hole in the ground

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.120
and then they were like and this would

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.520
be this this room was basically like a

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.380
modern day dishwasher they would put

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.880
their used dishes and it was just

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.860
clearly just two slaves were in there

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.539

character then at the end they show you

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.159
his teeth his actual dentures and like

00:29:29.159 --> 00:29:30.419

teeth attached to it on a lead denture

00:29:45.539 --> 00:29:47.760

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.100
had lead poisoning for sure

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.659
so George Washington was like a six foot

three

00:29:52.679 --> 00:29:55.260

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.919
teeth like

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.580
and then every account of him was like

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.500
he never said too much he was a man of

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.740
many a few words and just them being

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.700
like George do you want to be president

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.200

to Delaware or something yeah that was

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.640
him being a [ __ ] General yeah paid

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.380

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.820
go we gotta kill him [ __ ] yeah anyway

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.480
made me laugh yeah

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.520
when I found out that George like that

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.679
time of like time frame they would be

00:30:28.679 --> 00:30:30.120
like ripping teeth out of people to like

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.799
pop them in their own head on the

00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:33.179
battlefield that pumped me up I was like

00:30:33.179 --> 00:30:34.799
that's on the battlefield they used to

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.299
rip yeah the soldiers used to rip teeth

00:30:36.299 --> 00:30:37.740
out of people's head if someone was dead

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.020
they would just go pop their teeth out

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.240
and sell them and have a look and see if

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.320
they have any good ones yeah that was

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.179
common you either didn't if you had any

00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:46.740
if you had other people's teeth in your

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.659
mouth you were killing it mostly you

00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:51.059
just be have like no teeth yeah that was

00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:53.399
like people just be like you know like

00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:54.840
now like people get older like oh you're

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.220
fat and bald or whatever now it's like

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.320
you got your Chompers yeah it's like

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.720
dude he's got that full [ __ ] said he

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.220
used to brush his teeth he's still lost

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.460
did he really yeah

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.720
they're like slaves hair yeah

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.159
the brush was made out of somebody's

00:31:11.159 --> 00:31:15.000
tibia so apparently allegedly my uh my

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.100
pop-up on my mom's side used to take

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.380
soot out of the chimney and just rub it

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.820
on his teeth

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.519
he claims that works there's charcoal

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:24.960
toothpaste I don't know if that has I

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.580
think that's what it was yeah the

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.600
original I know if he was [ __ ] with

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.279
us but he's like yeah I just get sod out

00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:30.480
of the chimney and scrub it on my teeth

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.220
so that's what's up I'm pretty sure he

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.360
had like a toothbrush and [ __ ] but he

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.039
that's how he sold that's how he held it

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:36.480
down he used to tell us like yeah I just

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.100
rub that [ __ ] on my hand yeah don't mind

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.600
that Colgate [ __ ] that's [ __ ] yeah dude

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.019
yeah this is Colgate nice I like it come

00:31:43.019 --> 00:31:45.120
on yeah you learn a lot at Mount Vernon

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.440
well it's funny people when they brush

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.500
your teeth uh a lot of people brush her

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.940
teeth at a time that has nothing to do

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.860
with actually cleaning their teeth a lot

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:53.880
of people brush their teeth as soon as

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.019
they wake up

00:31:55.019 --> 00:31:56.580
which is

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.740
like you know you brush your teeth when

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.240
you wear this for your breath that's

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.740
what I'm saying it's more of a flavor

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.720
experience you want to just change the

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.100
flavor of your mouth and you eat you

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.140

world you're like

00:32:09.539 --> 00:32:11.279
true the point of brushing your teeth is

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:13.679
to clean the food off them

00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:15.659
yeah among other things yeah most people

00:32:15.659 --> 00:32:16.980

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.740
[ __ ] dude yeah I did the Hardcore

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.480
History thing and it was like accounts

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.940
through history of Ireland every single

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.040
like at like the Romans everybody that's

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.420
tried to go to Ireland has been like

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.720
these people are [ __ ] Savages no one

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.859
would conquer Ireland because everyone

00:36:31.859 --> 00:36:33.420
was like this place sucks yeah yeah

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.220
don't even go yeah there was a big thing

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.480
they were eating people there's a

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.740
[ __ ] their own mom so that was the

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.180
big thing it was a big thing with the

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.040
Romans like got to Ireland they're like

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.020
let's just [ __ ] who wants this [ __ ]

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.720
you can't even renovate this [ __ ] this

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.099
well I think we're all like yeah

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.480
in the conquer Rome for like a week

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.400
I think Celts conquered Rome for like a

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.099
week really yeah I think they stormed

00:36:59.099 --> 00:37:00.900
the capital I think they basically

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.460
stormed the capital put their feet up

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.500
and then eventually Romans were like all

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.180
right let's get them the [ __ ] out I know

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.280
I I vaguely remember that hardcore

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.200
history about that with like the Celts

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.480
were like considered stylish for the

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.920
Romans yeah so they would like start

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.500
dressing like Celts yep yeah well the

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.200
Celts would apparently uh like deck

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.060
their swords they would spend like all

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.560
their time making sure they looked cool

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.420
as [ __ ] and then ride into battle and

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:25.859
that was it that was the only plan like

00:37:25.859 --> 00:37:27.960
dude we're gonna look cool as [ __ ]

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.980
sick

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.119
I don't even look they're just looking

00:37:30.119 --> 00:37:31.740
at like a they would like they would

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.240
like their weapons would have like these

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.040
ornate [ __ ] designs on there was all

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.480
these things they did to like swords and

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.880
yeah they had like the color blue

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.160
yeah everyone else was like holy [ __ ]

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.900
what's that they're like the sky we've

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.460
got blue yeah their armor just looked

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.260
cool as [ __ ] and they were just like go

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.599
in and just Crush people and then uh you

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:51.000
know and then when he left so so funny

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.160
just to just putting together like color

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.960
coordinate yeah it was just it was like

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.280
a you know those kind of like sandals

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.720
matching my armor here you know you know

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.040
those like Lord of the Rings just like

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.839
like two people going together it was

00:38:00.839 --> 00:38:02.880
just like a 100 000 Conor McGregor's

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.079
dude just coming at you like I'm the

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:05.579
best Little Dicky bows and [ __ ] yeah

00:38:05.579 --> 00:38:08.160
nice yeah and then just a bunch of bunch

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.700
of whops with shields just like no

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.280
you look at the back get the back from

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.520
here

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.720
been a bunch of Irish people in the

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.960
woods

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.859
that's funny

00:38:28.859 --> 00:38:30.900
I was imagining like Jersey Shore versus

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:31.980
like

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:35.339
just Irish people whoa whoa whoa that's

00:38:35.339 --> 00:38:37.200
literally the Jersey Shore yeah there's

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.640
a bunch of whops and Irish people like

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.800
drunk irish guys coming out of like a

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.220
dark bar yeah damn dude the world was

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.200
conquered by the Jersey Shore for like a

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.880
while yeah a long time yeah it's pretty

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.720
tight

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.880
this is pretty tight what is sad it was

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.440
just gym tan and laundry throughout the

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.700
world almost the whole world was almost

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.740
gym to hand laundry Italy's never done

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.200
[ __ ] since since well the Renaissance

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.480
but yeah

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.700
yeah just think of devolving that hard

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.040
from like Julius Caesar to the situation

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.380
yeah it was a long timeline did you ever

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.060
look into I mean it was like a thing

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.440
that just got thrown to me on my YouTube

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.200
algorithm but the requirements for Roman

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.220
soldiers

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.720
there was like someone did a video on

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.160
like what they actually like were

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.599
looking for and they were saying the

00:39:18.599 --> 00:39:20.339
fall of Rome and again I don't know if

00:39:20.339 --> 00:39:22.380
this is a chicken or egg thing was very

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.359
much aligned with when they started to

00:39:24.359 --> 00:39:25.980
kind of like let go of like gender

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.099
strict yeah I just heard that really

00:39:29.099 --> 00:39:31.079
they let chicks in and well I think they

00:39:31.079 --> 00:39:32.520
stopped letting I didn't get to that

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.599
part but they were just saying like they

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:36.240
used to have like you know they tried to

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.220
find people what's funny here's some

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.260
women's history for you yeah his women's

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.380
history there's a criminal they let

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.720
women in the Army no I don't know so

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.920
what do they what do they let them be

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.760
like the president or something what

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.200
happened no I was saying I just was

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.220
listening I think it might have been on

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.720
rogie's a while ago someone was talking

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.119
about like civilizations tend to crumble

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:55.619
when they all start focusing on [ __ ]

00:39:55.619 --> 00:39:57.599
like gender yeah I mean that makes sense

00:39:57.599 --> 00:39:59.280
like once they get powerful enough for

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.960
guys to be like I'm actually a woman

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.540
yeah income the Conor McGregor is out of

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.480
the woods yeah

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.640
they have furniture well you're thinking

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.200
about like you're like what does it it's

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.060
like really mean and some guy's like

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.160
there's food yeah get it you're like

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.260
well stuff yeah

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.480
you guys are being [ __ ] uncool we

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.920
love you guys remember we didn't want to

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.240
put you in the [ __ ] game we dress

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.579
like you guys

00:40:22.579 --> 00:40:25.859
I've been stealing your culture

00:40:25.859 --> 00:40:27.240
but yeah they were saying that they

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.280
would the Roman army would look for

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.900
people in the country because they're

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:32.040
like people in the country who live off

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.599
the land they can go without food for a

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:34.740
long period like they they're already

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.599
kind of halfway trained yeah but with

00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:39.300
city folk they would take you like super

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.859
far away so like that way you couldn't

00:40:40.859 --> 00:40:42.119
go back to it you wouldn't know the [ __ ]

00:40:42.119 --> 00:40:43.440
you were yeah and they would try to

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.780
train them and then they uh they did a

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.339
thing where like if you could read that

00:40:47.339 --> 00:40:48.480
would like you would become like a

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.740
legion or something you'd be on the

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.000
track to be like I think a legion was

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.920
someone who Legionnaire like 80 people

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.480
or something

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.520
um and then they they got greedy and

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.660
they wanted more and more people so they

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.520
started being like you're good to get in

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.780
and there they said that was like

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.640
started letting the fats in yeah

00:41:06.359 --> 00:41:08.640
uh I forget the [ __ ] I couldn't

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.079
remember it was the one thing from that

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:11.880
star party I went to that I wanted to

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.720
remember

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.060
it was the guy was like if you look at

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.920
the Moon and then whatever star was next

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.079
to it if you could see that you passed

00:41:19.079 --> 00:41:21.000
the Roman military you see that was

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.760
their seeing test their eye test yeah it

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.980

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.180
when people are like rushing each other

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.800

there's a park near my house and I was

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.859
talking I think to my yeah I was talking

00:46:04.859 --> 00:46:06.780
to my brother about this recently like

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.339
dude I've seen and it was funny because

00:46:08.339 --> 00:46:09.599
he brought it to my attention this was

00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:11.400
something I thought only I noticed I've

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.460
seen a lot of like uh young publicly

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.920
overwhelmed dads at like parks and it's

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.900

like you talked about this before like

00:46:24.599 --> 00:46:27.359
that would suck have an MSNBC dad dude

00:46:27.359 --> 00:46:28.920
it's like at least I dealt with the

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.020
problems of having a high tea dad which

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.640
it kind of ruled like if you think about

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.440
it because it's like you know [ __ ]

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.119
they just like love beer and they might

00:46:36.119 --> 00:46:37.500
something might get pissed and [ __ ]

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.160

I didn't think Twitter's gay would be

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.619
tough dude actually my dad did try

00:46:58.619 --> 00:47:01.800

and my dad had no idea what Twitter was

00:47:25.619 --> 00:47:27.300

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.520

and then I get out and go into the mall

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.640
and I get there and I'm like I don't I

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.740

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.940
in bed just like

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:08.520
it's so funny but the story was these

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.619
two ladies they had an orphanage that

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:12.000

so for like to like help the kid I don't

01:08:27.239 --> 01:08:28.920
know they would lay out everybody was

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.120
suffering all the children were like

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.279

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:33.719
hungry they were starving to death yeah

01:08:33.719 --> 01:08:35.640
and they would lay them out these

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.500
children out on like a sh they said

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.960
sheets on the in the grass outside and

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.819
like let them lay and they would just

01:08:41.819 --> 01:08:43.620
constantly be moaning like the teachers

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.000
could leave and leave the kids out

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.980
because the kids couldn't move yeah and

01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:49.580
they would just be out there like

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:53.040
just uh yeah and then the story was that

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.900
one day they left them out they're

01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:56.100
probably like smoking cigarettes or

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.600
something and they all of a sudden the

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.100
kids were quiet so they're like oh [ __ ]

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.900
we gotta go check this out and they went

01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:02.699
out and the kids were tearing the flesh

01:09:02.699 --> 01:09:04.620
off of the smallest one

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:06.659
and sucking the blood and eating the

01:09:06.659 --> 01:09:08.460
meat and the kid was eating his own skin

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:09.600
too

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.299
anyway wow what a fun story it was like

01:09:12.299 --> 01:09:15.620
that's four years old dude

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:19.339
just in bed

01:09:19.819 --> 01:09:22.620
yeah they didn't pull the kids off they

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:24.120
were like literally like biting and

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.679
sucking they just one kid just latched

01:09:25.679 --> 01:09:27.060
onto the other and then they all kind of

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:29.219
just yeah rolled over yeah and then but

01:09:29.219 --> 01:09:30.600
the thing that [ __ ] me up the most was

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.179
the kid was eating himself also once

01:09:33.179 --> 01:09:34.380
everybody else started munching him he

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.600
was like oh [ __ ] oh yeah so they said he

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.679
was like give me a bit of that yeah yeah

01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:40.799
okay of himself and they would like eat

01:09:40.799 --> 01:09:43.080
their own [ __ ] would they yeah yeah they

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.400
would like find kids that have been

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.500
eating their own [ __ ] I mean it's the

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.060
craziest [ __ ] I've ever heard yeah it's

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.400
[ __ ] it's I mean it's terrible you

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.900
have food it's good it's nice to have it

01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:54.960
man yeah it was like the Irish famine

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.699
but like

01:09:56.699 --> 01:09:58.800
I mean now it was much more documented

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.600
you know it was in the 40s and it was

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.900
much more successful I think yeah yeah

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.640
they got a lot of them yeah no one was

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.380
able to even leave they all just I mean

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:09.480
a lot of guys fleeing yeah people a lot

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.640
of weak links left the island

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.120
became great true

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.440
built it up for you to come over yeah

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.840
yeah now look at you yeah I'm like oh

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.400
team's pretty good over there I'd like

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.719
to have a little uh shot to me

01:10:24.199 --> 01:10:26.100
hey that's what I've been listening to

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.440
and then in between horrific stories I

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.239
will ejaculate yeah do a little

01:10:30.239 --> 01:10:33.000
self-care yes what do you think of that

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.199
maybe that has something to do with I

01:10:34.199 --> 01:10:35.580
think it's not going to the mall looking

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.260
at things I could be I could be watching

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:40.020
the duck and then just be like yeah

01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:42.300
yeah of course yeah yeah

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.159
I don't know normally anything else I

01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:45.659
can't this is like totally just

01:10:45.659 --> 01:10:46.980
disassociate like these are two

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.840
different things yeah with this I know

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.219
that's probably not the right psychology

01:10:50.219 --> 01:10:51.540
term but you get what I'm saying pretty

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.980
much yeah

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:56.940
I can hit pause on this crank play yeah

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.800
anyway I think that's pretty I thought

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.239
that was an interesting tidbit no I

01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:02.460
think people can do that yeah I can

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:04.020
watch like a [ __ ] up horrible thing

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.960
it's no problem yeah turn it off jerk

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.640
off zero it's almost an understandable

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.800
thing to do after that

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.239
it's like when I can't sleep at night

01:11:12.239 --> 01:11:13.260
you know

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.600
when all the bats are floating around my

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.000
head I just go jerk off it's evil bats

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.640
you just go just get up get up that's

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.780
what I have to do yeah looks like I'm

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:22.980
just trying to get some milk in the

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.960
kitchen where are you going oh you got

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.140

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:30.560
[ __ ] me it's like

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:33.300

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.880
that the red yellow and green is very

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.920
popular among uh western African nations

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:47.040

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.159
colors guys what

01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:51.420
left

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.540
all right well where are we at Let's uh

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:57.239
men especially sexual excitation and

01:14:57.239 --> 01:15:00.000
orgasmic pleasure are primarily a

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.800
genital sensation

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.860
as one gets Freer the Locale of the

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.739
orgasm begins to expand and spread to

01:15:07.739 --> 01:15:10.080
the whole pelvis and abdomen is that

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.020
your legs and arms eventually the whole

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:15.020
body if you can guess this

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:17.820
accomplishment there is a plateau that

01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.159
follows and then suddenly and

01:15:20.159 --> 01:15:22.800
unexpectedly the orgasmic location

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.800
expands beyond the body as though the

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.020
space around the body was having the

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:31.080
orgasm instead of the person ultimately

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:34.620
there is no limitation of the orgasm it

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:37.739
seems to expand into infinity and be

01:15:37.739 --> 01:15:40.560
experienced from no particular Center or

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.620
Locale it is as if there is no

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:47.340
individual person present the orgasm is

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:50.340
experiencing itself that's how I call

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.679

01:15:52.679 --> 01:15:54.480
me he's coming and I'm just transcendant

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.179
he has many times before finding that

01:15:57.179 --> 01:15:58.980
passage explained that when he comes he

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.600
does leave his body even out of Body

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.270
Experience I'm definitely

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:05.379
[Music]

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.820
my body tries to go there but then

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:09.900
there's a part of me just goes no no no

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.120
