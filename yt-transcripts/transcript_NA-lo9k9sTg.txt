just about consuming stuff now it's the

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.959
step up is rejecting things that other

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:30.160
people consume and that's like the

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.839
ultimate if there's a thing other people

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.360
like and you can place yourself above it

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.320

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:04.480
what the first case

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.080
they were 100 percent coveted free that

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.520
their first case oh yeah you know how

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.559
they got it

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:10.640
somebody went into south korea and came

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.559
back and brought kovid cool to north

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.880
korea

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.960
do you think that's true uh no someone

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.880
ran to south korea got ko they got kova

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.000
they're like oh yeah clearly this is

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.120
what happens if you go to south carolina

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.559
you even go to south korea you get it

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:26.240
yeah that's my favorite thing to do is

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.280
look at those

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.840
like stats from china china's graph is

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.760
like oh we have it we have it it's gone

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.520
it's gone yeah statistically it's just

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.960
zero now it's very funny to look at

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.200
their their chart they were bush on the

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.440
[ __ ] air like we did it yeah mission

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.200
we gotta learn from them dude we need to

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.559
be more like china

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.240
it's hard to see where

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.240
china i've been trying to follow

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.760
i try to read the economist the atlantic

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.080
to see where you read those lib rags

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.320
they're elites uh economist isn't super

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.640
lit a little bit classic hilldog but

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.000
here's the thing no here's the thing

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.240
dude

00:18:58.799 --> 00:18:59.679
whoa

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:01.679
what'd you do i didn't touch it i was

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:04.240
interns that's true i was i was jake

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.640
dude so the jake the plug so right now

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.919
they're against

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:09.440
uh so right they're trying to say like a

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.880
vaccine's not going to help us they're

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.200
like you guys idiots thinking vaccines

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.720
are going to help you so that's yeah

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.760
that's the sentiment now and they're

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.440
also now who say that

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.320
the elites the elites

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.600
i thought the elites wanted us to get

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.640
vaccines

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.720
i

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.640
they don't they don't want uh this thing

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.440
to be resolved before november

it's just like it's a combination of all

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.559
the sickest stuff of just being like the

00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:23.440
world

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.640
it's like if you want to watch nine

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.000

pretty tight it sounds good so that's

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.840
the new that's the new target

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.360
but you don't know what you want to do

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.720

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:44.559
lot dude it's a bust it's a very it's a

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:45.840

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.039
dude it's literally it's dude the

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:52.880
youtube things are so funny you go on

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.640
there it's like imagine what you could

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.159
do with your mind if you had infinite

00:29:56.159 --> 00:29:58.320
potential damn your ads must be

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.320
hilarious oh they're so funny yeah like

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.520
you know how aliens are definitely

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.720
[ __ ] real

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.640
unlock the potential of your mind in the

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.159
fifth dimension i open up my youtube one

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:07.760
time around my mom my recommended videos

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.840
were like yield a pound in your basement

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.190
i was like what's that i was like

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:12.559
[Laughter]

00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:14.960
crazy i think you put that on

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.120
but yeah dude guy [ __ ] rules

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.640
[ __ ] yeah yeah man where are we at i

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.360
mean

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.039
think about it this way so you're

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:22.720
looking where are we at

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.640
yeah so that's probably 30 minutes so

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.159
you're looking at you know you obviously

00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:28.000
probably think tables are solid walls

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.080
are solid obviously so

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.840
imagine you can imagine wi-fi floating

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.279
through the air right

00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:35.200
so it doesn't look like it on a computer

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.399
screen the internet looks like what do

00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:38.159
you think it is like videos podcasts all

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:39.840
the stuff but really in the air it's

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.919
just [ __ ] information waveforms

00:30:41.919 --> 00:30:43.679
floating through the air so that's what

00:30:43.679 --> 00:30:45.679
that's what reality is there's an actual

00:30:45.679 --> 00:30:47.120
reality out there but we can only decode

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.880
it in the way we see it but really

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.240
there's other reality other than some

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.159
guy who teaches you to process it

00:30:52.159 --> 00:30:53.679
differently through your mind pretty

00:30:53.679 --> 00:30:55.360
much bro i mean i don't want to just way

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.279

was a version of a virus they were

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.000
studying because you have to ramp them

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.280
up in order to like look at certain

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.800
aspects of the virus i think it probably

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.720
got out intentionally unintentionally i

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.760

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.599
chernobyl they're like don't worry you

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.520
the stock market going up if everything

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.280
sucks yeah apparently there's like

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.119
companies so the stock market since it's

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:48.640
so like involved with other countries

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.400
like there there's companies here who

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.040
are

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.960
built they can't build enough like air

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.079
conditioning units because they're like

00:48:54.079 --> 00:48:55.200
there's all these third world countries

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.800
that are starting to come up so like the

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.559
american economy can kind of crumble and

00:48:58.559 --> 00:49:00.480
wall street can just continue to rise

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.599
because there's companies who are just

00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:03.440
selling like just every single air

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.200
conditioning unit they make it sells and

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.800
they're they're like they can't they

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.800
have like a 10 year back order for like

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.680
making them because there's like

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.880
billions of people coming up out of

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.280
poverty damn so america completely can

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.960
eat [ __ ] and then wall street your

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.200
stocks can still technically rise

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.880
like how's the stocks rise and very it's

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.079
like because those companies all go

00:49:20.079 --> 00:49:21.040

some sort of margin and like he opened

00:54:20.559 --> 00:54:22.240
his app and it was something the way the

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.640
the app resets where it told him he was

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.480
up a little bit it told him he was at

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.800
negative 800 000 just i think it was

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.480
like it was a glitch in the app so this

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.079

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.640
i don't know forks i have no idea

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.319
i don't look at that i look at the

00:56:44.319 --> 00:56:46.000
numbers and i look at

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.599
how it's

00:56:47.599 --> 00:56:49.200
how it's trending and why it's strength

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.760
what was the five-year average so on i

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.200
mean really right now nobody knows

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.040
because it jumps so [ __ ] high with

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.400
gold so quick and it's insane that

00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.760
i don't know it's a weird thing because

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.880
now uh what is it [ __ ] like bullets

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.640
and all that kind of [ __ ] is that like

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.079
record lows

00:57:06.079 --> 00:57:08.640
bullets yeah like you can buy both armor

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.240
no not stop but i'm saying like the

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:13.119
pricing on that record yeah yeah i

00:57:13.119 --> 00:57:15.040
wouldn't guess that yeah which is i

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.040
don't i don't get it and that's what i

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.799
used to do at jp was settlements and

00:57:18.799 --> 00:57:20.720
trends so it's like i see them so i have

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:23.040
to see like why it's trending but then

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.119
if there's no reason those are the one

00:57:25.119 --> 00:57:26.480

00:57:30.799 --> 00:57:32.319

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.400
bottom stalled you remember the [ __ ]

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.240
solve the towel yeah

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.880
come on those are royal you ever sit

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.720
there you gotta keep an eye on truckers

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.880
dude you can't let truckers get close

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.640
bottom stalls

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.079
oh yeah they're going down themselves

01:01:26.079 --> 01:01:27.359
they're definitely gonna be [ __ ] uh

01:01:27.359 --> 01:01:28.720
something glory hole central it's gonna

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.480
be dudes [ __ ] constantly your rest

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.920
stop is your rest stop's gonna be

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.359
there's a ton of holes in this thing

01:01:33.359 --> 01:01:36.160
yeah we'd have heavy security in there

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.640
you have hole security

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.760
you'd have to have the stalls like do a

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.200
thing where like every like you know

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.799
randomly every like 10 seconds or so

01:01:50.799 --> 01:01:52.240
they go completely transparent you can

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.400
see that just right yeah oh dude just

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.000
make sure there's nothing going on the

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.920
fixes table has to be clean at all times

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.960
too because usually those things are

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.520
disgusting peppers in the lettuce

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.040
pickles in the tomatoes i don't know

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.240
what's going on

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.760
so i would keep that clean and the

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.000
dining area a lot of windows

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.559
true are you gonna keep it segregated

01:02:10.559 --> 01:02:12.240
wow

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.680
shane you mentioned that in the car you

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.599
said if i ever had a rest stop we should

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:17.520
segregate these things right brother and

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.200
i said come on man

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.280
that's junk

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.640
shane actually

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.640
said that

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.400
and then you're like we're on that day i

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.559
said run the [ __ ] ball but no i mean

01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:30.079
i joke about it but if there is money in

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:31.440
a rest stop you really put some money

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.880
into one because some of the ones we've

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.359
seen are [ __ ] just horrendous i think

01:02:35.359 --> 01:02:36.559
that's the point i don't think you can

01:02:36.559 --> 01:02:38.480
do a nice rest off you can i've seen

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.079
them i mean the one we're in today the

01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:40.960
vincent

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.720

turnpike has some good rest stops does

01:02:47.359 --> 01:02:49.359
it really pretty quality stuff i guess

01:02:49.359 --> 01:02:51.280
they'll get better i mean like airport

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.799
stores in the terminal have gotten

01:02:52.799 --> 01:02:55.040
better yeah so store in the airport

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.480
that's another one

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.680
they gotta make sure but you gotta have

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.200
the right [ __ ] thing you know what i

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:03.240
mean yeah i don't know

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.880
you could probably get some merch and

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.040
set up in the airport yep just start

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.640

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.119
found it yeah yeah so i'm thinking i'm

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:29.839
thinking

01:06:29.839 --> 01:06:32.880
bobby dude the uh but yeah so they they

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.079
went through that i think they have

01:06:34.079 --> 01:06:35.599
algorithms to sniff that out like there

01:06:35.599 --> 01:06:37.599
is going to be an algorithm on reddit

01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:39.520
that just they all they do is still word

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.200
search is the easiest [ __ ] thing

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.480
but count them up i think we're on

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.160
borrowed time i think we get like 700

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:44.960
more

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.240
i think we're done i think i think

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.359
they'll see it and be like all right

01:06:47.359 --> 01:06:48.480
people are gonna start hitting it pretty

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.039
hard yeah this podcast will do us no

01:06:51.039 --> 01:06:53.440
favors oh that i mean that is the yeah

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.359
you know this is just gonna

01:06:55.359 --> 01:06:56.960
it's just slapping the [ __ ] hornets

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.680

01:07:01.039 --> 01:07:02.079
think people should do whatever they

want man i think they should do whatever

01:07:03.359 --> 01:07:04.240

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.520

01:21:34.239 --> 01:21:35.920
two goals i would really really like you

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.800
