00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.090
what up squad I'm planning a new segment

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.930
it is called counterintelligence where I

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.510
go on other boy asked to be a guest on

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.460
other people's podcast like you know

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.860
going like reddit podcast and find

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.680
random people and I'll just pretend to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.369
be like air like experts in different

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.400
fields like advertise myself is like you

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.320
know an ex-marine my bad for stealin

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.029
valor but I'm gonna probably you know

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.410
present myself as a bunch of different

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.119
types of people to get on the podcast

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.300
and then just completely you know see

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.620
how long you can take for them to figure

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.180
out that I'm just totally full of [ __ ]

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.829
and then it's called counterintelligence

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.660
because I'm gonna rethink their

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.250
recording a podcast but really I'm

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.530
recording them thinking they're

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440
recording me hence the term

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.489
counterintelligence yeah oh the reason

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.289
I'm even telling you guys this is

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.730
because you if you guys are on the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.190
reddit you'll see me like jumping into a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.660
bunch of weird podcasts discussions and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.219
saying them a bunch of different things

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.650
so I don't want whoever's on the reddit

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.689
also to be like oh this guy's a [ __ ]

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.119
liar so and also don't blow up the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.590
[ __ ] spot if you see me on there

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.049
telling people I think I advertise

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.729
myself recently as a card counter that's

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.340
banned from Vegas so I'm gonna try to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.890
just think of any kind of thing put

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.900
myself out there hopefully I still got

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.310
to talk to billions but about this but

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.799
I'm gonna also try to have billions

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.299
spotting on one and say that like we

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.810
know we're like we're all like retired

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.240
football players or like we were we were

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.979
like I don't know saying we did some

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.790
like top-secret [ __ ] Blackwater

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.490
military [ __ ] and yeah so oh I also I'm

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.200
gonna start I might live stream it to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.090
well I do it so I think it'd be kind of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.890
funny that way I could be in

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.869
communication with the dogs while I'm

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.729
again this is a high-level intelligence

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.979
operation I'll be in communication with

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.710
the dogs while I'm on another what

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.149
someone thinks is a podcast but really

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.880
it's my podcast so hopefully that'll you

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.689
know hopefully I can whip something

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.920
together depending on how many people

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.479
get back to me wanting to have me on

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.660
I'll try to whip some of those together

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.000
and that'll be I could do that forever

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.829
on red it'll be so [ __ ] easy

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.810
bunch of [ __ ] podcasters out

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.329
here trying to make it name and I'm

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.900
going to ruin it
