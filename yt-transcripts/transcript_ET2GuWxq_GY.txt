long-distance relationship but he was

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.359
from hawaii yeah and uh

he got catfished by a chick that

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.320
was from hawaii

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.840
wasn't it it was a dude it ended up

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.880
being a dude but then they had i forget

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.240
what show it was it might have been dr

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.680
phil it was one of these garbage shows

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.720
that the guy who catfished teo was on

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.880
and they were like do the voice you used

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.119
for him and it was they were talking on

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.080
the phone

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.280
yeah he had a hot voice he would call

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.280
him on the phone and use a girl's voice

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.439
and then he did the voice on tv and it

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.759
sounded like a chick like it was crazy

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.400
it was a gay dude catfishing

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.880
taylor and fonses perhaps definitely

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.400
dude perhaps

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.720
true that that's a strong accusation

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.680
against a great linebacker that's true

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.680
he had six interceptions his senior year

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.399
as a goddamn middle linebacker

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.680
you think it was just a fan who was like

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.759
god i love the way he plays yeah it was

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.960
a fan from hawaii

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.159
shane victory now not a lot going on

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.680
dude no he's over there there's not a

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.040
lot of manatees dude

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.599
it's just you drive around hawaii and

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.200
you have people from hawaii who just

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.480
passed you are like get the [ __ ] out of

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.680
the way and you're like yeah this place

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.400
kind of sucks no but manti teo was

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.360
probably gay you think i don't know i

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.120
don't know but i i that's a strong

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.720
accusation he was dumb enough to get

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.080
catfished

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.680
i don't know if that but then that dude

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.599
has hot voi you're in the nfl the dude

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.519
had hot voice he wasn't in the nfl i

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.040
think he cheated on his imaginary

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.440
girlfriend and felt bad

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.239
i bet he did feel bad a couple times

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.040
but now what i think happened was he got

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.360
he got a phone call that was like

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.760
lynnae died that was the girl's fake

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.560
name

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.720
and he was probably like

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.160
i mean he probably

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.760
was sad about it

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.680
but then the cameras got involved and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.720
they were like oh we hear your

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.080
girlfriend died how are you going to

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.360
keep playing

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.200
and then he started chumming it up for

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.120
the cameras really because his grandma

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.800
died like that week too

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.959
and his fake girlfriend so it was his

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.879
girlfriend and grandma died in the same

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.560
week and then he went out and played

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.080
against michigan state in the hell of a

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.760
game in michigan yeah i mean he was

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.840
second in the heisman voting as a middle

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.440
linebacker you think that messed up his

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.599
heisman him having a fake girl no it

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.680
came out after the fact okay

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.920
so he lost the heisman fair and square

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.760
what was she doing for picks he had to

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.440
have asked for picks

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.720
she was just crappy it's pretty easy to

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.319
capture that's true that yeah

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.760
especially if you're i mean he was this

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.760
star he was the captain of notre dame's

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.239
football team so it's like

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.319
honestly lynnae was probably a side

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.239
piece for this mormon [ __ ] i heard

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.599
that dude you know what i mean he was

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.040

bottom [ __ ] that's my ldr dude down in

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.799

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.879

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.479
into it but uh

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.639

he

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.440

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.960
spacey is definitely a game for sure

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.560
dude there's one scene where he's

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.080
practicing because he has to throw an

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.360
opening pitch

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.520
that was the only way he was dude that's

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.280
when they found out about that young boy

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.800

fantasyland

00:24:57.919 --> 00:24:59.840
where it's about like this guy's ideas

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.279
that america

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:03.840
is based off of people who are prone to

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.520
believing in fantasy

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.960
basically being like we're a nation of

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.440
like utter suckers who

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.679
are led purely by fantasy

00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:12.480
and

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.919
i don't [ __ ] like it dude i'm

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:15.200
listening to this guy's book he's it

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.520
just sounds like really snobbish so far

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.880
or he'll like he'll talk about like the

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.679
original people from england and be like

00:25:21.679 --> 00:25:23.360
there was like you know the population

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.600
was growing faster than the economy so

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.720
there was like all these people who were

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.240
getting rounded up and sent over here

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.000

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.760
dream and they there was no gold here

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.360

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.960
trying to expose so far yeah so far was

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.159
kind of like dude this is a stretch

00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:42.080
because it's like it's easy to sit here

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.320
now and be like oh these guys thought

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.480

about that [ __ ]

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:12.720

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.880
you come here you don't even know this

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.799

i that [ __ ] that stance on you know

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.799
what's weird about that is columbus

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:42.480
wrote in his journal that these people

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.679
would make fine slaves when he landed

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:48.320
that was just in his journal yeah yeah

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.000
that's his personal thoughts bro i mean

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.279
he of course he ended up cutting

people's ears off and [ __ ]

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:55.120
and genociding but yeah you know that

killing it

00:28:44.399 --> 00:28:46.000
i just hate when people put a modern

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.320
mentality on the 1600s it's like dude

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.799
you have no [ __ ] idea yeah of course

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:52.640
yeah i gotta let you read that book dude

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.559
what's more on the run dude what's that

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:56.720
about it's about i've read it a while

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.559
ago and then i i started reading it

00:28:58.559 --> 00:28:59.600
again

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.600
uh it's about robert rogers he was one

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.559
of the he was like the first army ranger

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:06.000
tech he was like one of the he was like

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.320
the precursor of special forces

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.960
in modern military and he lived in

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.760
pre-french and indian war america

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.240
in like vermont new england and the i've

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.520
talked about it a bunch of times what'd

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.520
he do savages would come in and kill

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.440
everybody in his town oh didn't he

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.880
didn't he take up with the savages then

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.720
he kinda took up with the savages like

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.919
he was raised alongside a tribe with his

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:30.880
uh town yeah yeah so he studied the land

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.880
he knew the land and he knew modern war

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.799
was going to be different than

00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:36.559
standing in line so he formed kind of

00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:38.799
like a special forces where they could

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:40.960
travel long distances so he's the reason

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.200
our navy seals are so sneaky basically

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.880
they still study his

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.520
his maneuvers to this day that's tight

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.919
yeah but it's it the first couple

00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:51.679
chapters are all about like landing in

00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:52.640
america

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.960
and it's being like holy [ __ ]

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.559
his family and another family they're

00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:58.399
they're scots irish

00:29:58.399 --> 00:30:00.320
and they're like we need to

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.840
we can we can try to make our own

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.840
outside of this village let's try to

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.919
they formed clans they joined families

00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:08.399
with another family and bought like

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:11.360
600 acres for like 11 pounds in america

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.039
yeah who'd they buy it off

00:30:13.039 --> 00:30:14.559
it was british whatever bowl was cheap

00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:16.080
yeah but then it was kind of like you

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.440
said like they would let the white trash

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.440
kind of be a buffer yeah so his family

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.960
was a white trash buffer and he'd be

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.399
like go ahead bro they're like you can

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:24.559
have that land if you can settle it

00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:26.880
damn and then up until

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.159
i mean up until at thomas jefferson

00:30:30.159 --> 00:30:32.960
nobody had really gone west of

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.720
like america hadn't really expanded at

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.559
all where'd tj go

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:39.120
the louisiana purchase uh that was tj he

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.640
got all that [ __ ] yeah

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.640
and he led his i like to see a couple

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.600
pages his journal dude he led uh he was

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.600
the one who founded the

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.520
lewis and clark expedition

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.360
yeah so the first two presidents were

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.120
just like we don't even know about the

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.039
pacific ocean they're like we're not

00:30:55.039 --> 00:30:56.399
going over there well that was the other

00:30:56.399 --> 00:30:57.600
thing that we're not getting over there

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.880
they were saying that i probably knew

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.000
about it he was like kind of like

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.520
scoffing at the fact that like when they

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.760
got there the native americans were like

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.159
there's a big there's like a big sea if

00:31:06.159 --> 00:31:08.080
you go like seven days walk from here

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.320
and they do the language barriers un

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.159
unimaginable and they're like this guy

00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:14.000
actually thought like the south ocean

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.159
the south indian ocean was like seven

00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:19.279
days away and it's like dude [ __ ] you

00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:20.799

chaps my ass without getting burned

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.720
that's the ultimate armchair quarterback

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.880
to be like honey crashed into the wrong

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.039
landmass

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:39.120
yeah just being like clearly these guys

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.039
are he was saying like the people who

00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:42.159
weren't

00:31:42.159 --> 00:31:43.120
uh

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.440
the people who weren't suckers stayed in

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.200
england it's like yeah it's more than

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.480
being a sucker dude it's like these

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.799
people were poor as [ __ ] yeah and they

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:52.640
didn't have any other choice really

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.679
and a lot of them were indentured

00:31:53.679 --> 00:31:54.960
servants too

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.080
so it's like

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.559
yeah it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] thesis and

00:31:58.559 --> 00:31:59.679
i've had people tell me like this is

00:31:59.679 --> 00:32:00.720

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.880
is like in this country

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.399

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:22.799

being nice to you and this and [ __ ] like

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.679

[ __ ] brad sometimes

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.760

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.440

this [ __ ] just shuts down dude yeah

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:10.960
shuts down that was my theory too with

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.720
like because i learned from being

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.480
married is like if you take your wife on

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.399

00:34:19.839 --> 00:34:21.040
when the lights come on it's like

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.399
they're back in the movie it's like the

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:23.760
back's metal and there's a magnet in the

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.520
bed they just [ __ ] they lay right

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.839
down stuck to it it's crazy dude sorry

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:29.280

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.320

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.520

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:48.800

basically from like a psychological

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.160
perspective and the thing i learned is

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.440

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.079
dumb about the time i tried to extract

00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:22.560
that flashlight out of my room yeah

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.720
so i was at work and caitlyn was

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.160
cleaning my room

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.040
and i

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.400
i knew she was coming so i hid my

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.480
fleshlight and just in a book bag

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.000

which actually in hindsight a little

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.200
suspect yeah i think she was combing the

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.960

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.079
there that's what my mom my mom used to

00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:43.839
do that to us yeah she would go through

00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:45.520
this was early in our long distance

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.880
relationship i think she wanted to see

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.480
where i stood see if she had some

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.839
magnets so maybe she should have been

00:46:49.839 --> 00:46:52.000
