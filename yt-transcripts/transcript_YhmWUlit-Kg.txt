00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.840
collection that was hell yeah that was

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.120
like the one number one indicator that i

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.680
was a loser having a bad pediatrician

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.840
dude this lady will

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.280
maya had to go to the hospital for this

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.959
thing one time and

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.959

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.159
order this test and i'll tell the doctor

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.120
it's like we're not doing that i'm like

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.480
my pediatrician says you have to do this

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.840
and they would be like

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.720
i was like they're not doing it she's

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.159
like give me their number right now and

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.760
she called them and just started

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.879
[Â __Â ] them all and she was like

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.239
i need these tests you need to send them

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.000
to me right now they took the test it

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.760
turned out that she found what that test

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.519
found out with my head

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.560
they wouldn't have known if they didn't

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.599
take it they're like we're not going to

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.560
do that and she was like i need that

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.360
test

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.720
turned out it was like some she had two

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.239
viruses at once that's why her fever was

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.920
spiking so i think i think this might it

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.599
might just be hospital doctors that are

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.199
posing it's crazy yeah because they have

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.639
to do like a little bit of everything

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.079
you know and most of the people that go

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.400
to hospital doctors are lying anyway

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.919
they deal with a lot you don't believe

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.919
anybody yeah you know like you go to

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.600
your pediatrician she's she builds up a

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.960
relationship with you she knows your

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.479
tics and [Â __Â ] true she's like his

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.400
pediatrician's like house

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.639
dude she housed the situation yeah sure

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.919
she was like i don't know something that

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.280
doesn't check out to me tell them to

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.360
test for this dude like it turns out it

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.199
was uh this that and this

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.720
i wonder if she's like a drug addict in

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.400
her personal life i hope that would be

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.000
so sick i hope i'll be sick if she was

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.800
addicted to mushrooms

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.560
wait it was house a drug addict or did

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.840
you just have a limb he became a pain

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.160
pill head yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.000
no hospital doctors they do not believe

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.919
anything anybody says they think that's

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.160
why they have a god complex because like

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.400
they've seen so many people

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.639
like their their lives be proved

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.639
you know lies for sure that they think

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.120
they get everybody now

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.600
oh okay okay yeah yeah yeah okay yeah

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.840
like so i think they're just trying to

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.440
make sure that somebody doesn't die

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.960
that's all they're doing yeah so their

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.400
whole thing is like and i do think they

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.479
deal with an enormous amount of liars so

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.240
many liars in hospitals yeah i followed

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.479
a complaint against an emergency room

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.520
what happened

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.199
because when i when i broke what are you

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.880
complaining to by the way

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.720
uh some human resources oh that's right

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.400

you stand on the band leg and push it

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.240

that's athleticism yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:16:58.399 --> 00:17:00.320
it did require definite forearm strength

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.480
and core strength it required stability

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.480
from the whole entire top half right did

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.799
people run when you were doing that if

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:09.600

i have learned that for some reason and

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.000
like i would think this wouldn't be the

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.600
case and i actually do want to know what

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.400
happened to the hospital

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.919

maybe a little gopro action oh for sure

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.400
look up pill head on sick bike

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.799
that brings up anything that high def

00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:44.559
rider almost killed

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:47.279
yeah i uh i had a dude actually we had a

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:49.200
guy on a mountain bike like riding along

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.039
38 new jersey just on the highway for

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:53.200
who the [Â __Â ] knows why yeah and he was

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.559
doing the same thing veering out in the

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:56.000
highway and going back and veering out

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.240
and like dude i came flying along and he

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.760
veered out i had to like jam my brakes

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.440
and i almost if i wasn't paying

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.440
attention i would have killed this guy

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.799
like j i would have

00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:06.320
absolutely killed this guy was anything

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.080
about him visually pretty sick

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.360
sucks i think one of the biggest

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.760
problems is like i was a dirty [Â __Â ]

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.679
piece of [Â __Â ] dude

00:25:15.679 --> 00:25:17.200
his bike his bike was also a third it

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.039
was like stunk you're not a hot you

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:20.720
can't i think he was genuinely trying to

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.640
like get in i think he'd break in the

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.760
house this guy was [Â __Â ] up i think

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.520
this guy was trying to [Â __Â ] get the

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.520
ultimate payoff either i'll die or get

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.080
paid all these dudes start i think by

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.679
like listening to biggie while riding a

00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:33.440
bike one time and you just swerve a

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.880
little bit like back and forth you're

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.919
like damn this is a pretty good feeling

00:25:35.919 --> 00:25:37.520
yeah yeah and they just

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.279
they never come back from that that's

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:41.039
fully into that feeling yeah

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.559
that is high def

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:43.919
yeah that's the path in the woods of

00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:45.600
your life that guy couldn't go down that

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.200
it's true it's gonna be locked into mac

more of a reaction to pain than this

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.000
white parent and a black parent you know

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.720

00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:55.120
thing like if you have if there's like

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.880
an interracial adult you think you have

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.320

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.480
like very like in-depth mutual set up

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.440

00:31:49.039 --> 00:31:50.399
like the white advantage black people

00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:51.519

00:34:06.399 --> 00:34:08.800
thinking about captain picard was he was

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.480
okay lemaire was he so principled that

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.079
it made him kind of a [Â __Â ] what do you

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:15.200
mean captain picard i mean yeah

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:15.610
all right

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:18.159
[Laughter]

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.079
what do you mean yeah he was so he was

00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:22.079
so strongly guided by like his core

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:23.119
principles that it kind of made him

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:24.560
[Â __Â ] sometimes yeah

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.560
he was kind of lame mm-hmm so what do

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.679
you what are you thinking about him

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.599
though i was just that's just what i

00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:30.960
think about starship because that show

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.560
would always come on that star trek show

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.079
would always come on when i was like

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:36.639
sleeping i should turn it off

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:38.240
what i don't know why that would come on

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.200
when i was a kid and i'd get like

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.560
intensely like

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.079
i get like an intense angst i'm like i

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:43.280
shouldn't watch this and i would turn it

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.119
off every time yeah i thought something

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:46.159
like bad was gonna happen to me

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:47.839
personally if i started watching this i

00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:49.040
thought it was the most boring thing in

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.000
the world

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.520
dude i'm telling you i was just like no

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.359
and i would turn it off dude if any

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:55.919
sci-fi show that you're not into looks

00:34:55.919 --> 00:34:58.320
like the most boring show to ever exist

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.560
yeah it does like you're you if you're

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.800
not into it your eyes and your brain

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.320
don't allow you to suspend this belief

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.680
enough to make it you're not in the same

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.079
trance yeah you ever watched doctor who

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:10.560
that show i'm just like [Â __Â ] i do it

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.800
that to me is like one of the biggest

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.140
indicators of a [Â __Â ] creep

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.280
[Laughter]

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.760
for sure that's such an enormous red

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.000
flag yeah yeah that's the pattern oswald

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.440
breed of white people as far as i'm

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.920
concerned really yeah

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.119
it's going to become a bad time for

00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:31.200
those types dude dude i guarantee you

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.880
that [Â __Â ] emergency room doctor that

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.240
i was [Â __Â ] with was a doctor i could

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.160
almost guarantee that as well for sure

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.680
by the way so the reason why i made the

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.640
complaint

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.440
is she after she told me my she read my

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.440
my chart or my x-rays she closed the

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.160
folder and [Â __Â ] threw it at me

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.480
what the [Â __Â ] yeah and it like like the

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.480
folder hit me you got a paper cut yeah

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.640
but then like but then the x-rays slid

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.320
out it like went up and hit me in the

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.040
chin

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.640
dude you got hit with your own bones it

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.400
was pretty good

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.760
she you carted your own bones at you she

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.920
did dude it's the media thing you said

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.000
like your shin is actually the shin it

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.119
is it's the [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] it's like a

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:08.079
side thing

00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:10.720
dude it's like yeah it's it's what i

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.800
it's exactly what i described yeah yeah

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.320
this area is the front of your leg shin

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.640
yeah she hit you up like a median fibula

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.160
yeah it's like what happened [Â __Â ] she

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.760
was just magic weapon and he knew where

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.720
it was

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.240
she was just man why lemur you webbed

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.079
him dieter i did

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:27.839
actually i i sid m dieter

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.720
this is like a disease dude i thought

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.520
you said wed and beat her

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.680

beat her

00:36:42.079 --> 00:36:45.359
officer i didn't beat her

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:47.119
yeah dude i uh

00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:49.040
speaking of bourdain dude going by the

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.400
wayside

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.480
i was reading about i think it kind of

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.400
ties to this so i was reading about eegs

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.240
of like meditators yeah and how there's

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.839
like different um like they show a

00:36:57.839 --> 00:36:59.440
different brain activity check my uh

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.839
heartbeat which yeah i'm at 72 right now

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:03.920
71. good yeah i would guess that you're

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.440
interested you get on that dude yeah

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.800
this microaggression oh i guess you're

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.119
in the 80s i mean you know my resting is

00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:10.400
53 i don't think you were able to

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.480
calculate that true when you assume

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.079
70 is a good place to be i feel like i'm

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:15.400
at 130 right now

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:20.800
[Laughter]

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.760
yeah

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.560
but i'm sorry you were saying oh yeah so

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.640
see i'm researching the um

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.480
like the eeg effects on meditators and

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.160
how there's like

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.200
they just say like they just show your

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.480
brain activity and how they show like

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.240
different types of meditation do

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.160
different types of brain activity

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.920
but they're saying that there's this

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.359
thing called eeg habituation that is the

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:44.320
reason or at least the like

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.760
brainwave

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.680
illustration of like getting really used

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.599
to stuff and like losing novelty on

00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:51.200
things so there's this thing like if you

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.800
show someone a thing multiple times i

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.920
think they do this to test for i think

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.240
parkinson's too if you if like you don't

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.000
get like that if your eeg waves don't

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.760
eventually like kind of slow down like a

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.520
thing like the more times you see it you

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.280
produce less like intense activity in

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.119
your brain yeah the novelty of it wears

00:38:05.119 --> 00:38:06.720
off and your brain starts to kind of

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.280
just like gloss it over in a weird way

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.640
what do you think the most

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.960
novel thing pos that we could possibly

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.960
measure would be what would generate the

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.240
most

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.440
will be the thing that you put in front

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.320
of someone and it fires their eeg off

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.800
first come ever yeah

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.800
first come ever pretty that's a pretty

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.040
big one yeah aren't you just like

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.320
letting them stab a person

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.560
true

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.520
a rocket launcher maybe they're tied at

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.920
somebody though

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.520
direct hitting someone with an rpg like

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.079
even after you fire it does that like

00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:43.920
we're just still nails a guy we're just

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.760
talking about into a doctor who meet and

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.839
greet

00:38:49.119 --> 00:38:52.640
directly into the er

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:54.960
matt didn't you say like yesterday you

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.400
saw you were reading a book about some

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.400
guy who was like he got bored with

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.599
killing

00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:01.440
or was i just like

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.040

me stories about his military uh

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.119
experiences before he ever told ansley

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:20.880
so ansley was hearing stories for the

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.680
first time because of me and she was

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.200
pissed i actually had the same situation

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.440
yeah my previous yeah she she got over

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.359

was there

00:39:45.599 --> 00:39:47.440
and oh she would just be sitting there

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.880
just like because the stories are

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.720

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.880
down the road and they were just like

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.960
the road the dirt road was just lined

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.720
with heads on pikes

take a piss and they just all started

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.400
cracking up and he went over there to

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.160
see what they were laughing at and one

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.560

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.000
a hundred people who got decapitated

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.720

and just being like why didn't i never

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.200

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.680
life yeah

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.160
did you do uh danny can you just

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.920
anything that the chat is saying at all

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.920

they said no okay fair enough fair

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:52.160
enough

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.480
they kind of spun out over a girl being

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.920
in the chat earlier

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.359
there's a girl in the chat and the boys

00:41:57.359 --> 00:41:58.640
went nuts

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.599
that'll absolutely stabilize

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:03.280
the yeah like the fact that she doesn't

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.960
even have to show her tits you know what

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.800

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.000
yeah but dude it's a girl

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.359
from a girl

00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:12.480
yeah but here's the thing though you're

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.839
out there you're chilling you're

00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:16.480
listening to all this nonsense and then

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.599
you're like i'm never going to find a

00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:20.240
girlfriend and the girl pops up

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.359
and you go

00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:22.640
where is she

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.640
give me here where is she get it over

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.599
here yo you're this asl asl you're going

00:42:27.599 --> 00:42:29.359
that you're going that lady you're going

00:42:29.359 --> 00:42:31.599
at ladies with your eegs too high yeah

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:33.920
are you eg's eeg

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.200
their eegs are too high when they're

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.240
approaching ladies they need to

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.400
habituate that yeah you need habituated

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.839
uh yeah true

00:42:39.839 --> 00:42:41.119
yeah man well what they were saying is

00:42:41.119 --> 00:42:43.440
people who meditate all the time

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.760
also experience uh

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.240
a lack of eeg habituation where like

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.560
reality is appearing fresh to them more

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.319
but also again it also is

00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:53.920
so if you also might have too low you

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.440
can increase it with meditation they're

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.200
saying you make reality look more novel

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.119
and fresh to you by removing the filters

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:01.040
you're running all over it pretty sick

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.560
dude they're also talking about how

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.160
they'll probably make you bust sooner

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.680
too big time you could probably get all

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.359
the way back to premature ejaculation

00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:09.760
with that for sure

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.000
i wonder if that's why i come so fast it

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.119
could be

00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:14.319
you might have not you might have low

00:43:14.319 --> 00:43:16.560
eeg habitually i do like everything is

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.800
amazing to me all the time

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.319
yeah like there's nothing that's i'm

00:43:20.319 --> 00:43:21.599
like oh yeah that's old hat i'm like

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:23.680
yeah [Â __Â ] do it again [Â __Â ] yeah

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.040
that's awesome yeah you might have low

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.480
eeg habituation

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.760
because that's crazy to think you're

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.920
like interacting with objects and

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.000
there's like the interaction between you

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.520
there's like an invisible force that's

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.040
just slowly dulling and fading

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.640
constantly dude i feel that might have

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.920
been what drove anthony bourdain to hang

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.960
himself that's what i'm saying i thought

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.119
about like how many [Â __Â ]

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:42.240
beautiful dinners can you eat in

for me is any time the trash guys come

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.079

00:43:54.079 --> 00:43:56.319

pretty close i understand you guys are

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:02.880

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.520
10 beats per minute

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.800
that's a jump

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.200
that's a big jump

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.440
that's a spike before even saying a word

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.040
about them just thinking about sex

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.839
spiked his heart rate by 10

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:37.599
11. what happens is too because you have

00:49:37.599 --> 00:49:39.280
a mental representation of snacks the

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.200
mayor just snacked

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.880
all the snacks just flashed before the

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.359
mayor's eyes yeah the speed of light

00:49:45.359 --> 00:49:47.520
you get a biological response to like a

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.599
concept he just re-experienced himself

00:49:49.599 --> 00:49:52.079
snacking and was like oh jesus christ

00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:53.760
were you were you able to snack freely

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.280
or did you have to like hurry were you a

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.960
scurrier were you a higher

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.960

experience yeah i spiral yeah i don't

00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:55.760
like almost every time actually oh every

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.839

00:52:57.839 --> 00:53:00.720
uh like a pure sativa for me really yeah

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.760

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.319
like

00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:08.160
pay attention to like weird youtube

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.440
documentaries for like an hour and a

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.240
half

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.920
have no business yeah dude i'm starting

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.160
to wonder like am i am i just taking in

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.559
too much just information just from like

00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:18.319
watching like woodworking videos and

00:53:18.319 --> 00:53:21.040
[Â __Â ] for 30 years of my life i think so

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.079
i don't think yeah

00:53:22.079 --> 00:53:23.359
there comes a point where you just have

00:53:23.359 --> 00:53:24.880
to stop taking in new stuff i don't

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.400
think our brains are made for

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.400
disconnected bits of information

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.920
we're supposed to be like honed in on a

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.559
specific skill yeah not like this thing

00:53:32.559 --> 00:53:33.760
and that thing nothing and then i was

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.119
watching a video about this guy who's

00:53:35.119 --> 00:53:36.880
continuing this like thousand year old

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.480
tradition of making clay tiles and he's

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.680
just like sitting on the floor all day

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.200
and like damn i could definitely live

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.800
that life yeah

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.480
yeah you got good indian style too like

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.720
how was he on the floor uh it depended

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.319
on because he was doing each step

00:53:48.319 --> 00:53:50.000
differently i'm combining a couple

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.280
different videos in my head but there

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.280
there's like typically it's like a guy

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.319
just sitting in the dirt in like a

00:53:54.319 --> 00:53:56.160
marketplace and there's like a stone

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.319
tool that he uses this is i'm describing

00:53:58.319 --> 00:53:59.839
five different videos right now for five

00:53:59.839 --> 00:54:01.839
different crafts yeah and then he'll sit

00:54:01.839 --> 00:54:04.000
like he'll either so here's the thing if

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.359
he's gonna be there a while he'll go

00:54:05.359 --> 00:54:08.240
full panda and just like flat flat

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.520
indian style on the ground it doesn't

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.880
look that comfortable but they can

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.559
maintain it for hours for sure and then

00:54:12.559 --> 00:54:13.839
if you're going to be like picking up

00:54:13.839 --> 00:54:15.760
like a clay or a doe and slapping it

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.680
down oh [Â __Â ] they'll hit like this kind

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.079
of thing oh okay they'll do blah blah

00:54:20.079 --> 00:54:21.760
blah blah blah blah blah you know what i

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.359
mean that's rules

00:54:23.359 --> 00:54:24.960

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.640

00:54:58.319 --> 00:55:00.400
had endless source material and you just

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.240
