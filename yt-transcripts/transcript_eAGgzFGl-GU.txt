HIGH AND TIGHT!! On this week's YMH, Tom Segura and Christina P swap sharting stories, take a look at YMH staffer Chris Larson's most recent Instagram videos, discuss Christina's "Mom Song" that she recorded with Kreayshawn, talk about their most recent live show, and call Top Dog to discuss the problems he's been having with his taint. They watch videos of a cool guy who wants to eat your brown, updates from Unk Shine and The King, an insane chiropractor clip, a vintage mechanical video which drops the r-word, and more.

Shane Gillis is a comedian and host of "Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast." He joins the Main Mommies to discuss his new stand-up special "Shane Gillis Live in Austin," how to do a Donald Trump impression, Texas' new abortion law, and getting bullied by college kids at an FSU game. Tom and Christina share some "Horrible or Hilarious" videos, TikToks, and a cool clip of a person explaining bug pronouns with Shane.

plea is i'm here to serve you i'm

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.920
putting you on a pedestal i'm demeaning

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.760
diminishing myself

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.600
in in your worship but don't you think

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.680

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.519
oh i could lick your [ __ ] girl make you

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:01.120

me you know okay i feel like i

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.040
understand what you're saying you know

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.320
what you see that it's the distinction

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.760
here i understand what you're saying i

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.200

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.959
eat you that's what i'm talking about

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:13.440
like that one is not a good plea well

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.360
it's interesting that we use him as an

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.880
example

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.160
because

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:18.959
he

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:21.519
is he has this message that i feel like

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:24.160
oh my kind of straddles the two worlds

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.470
right now and i want to know

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.640
[Laughter]

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.880
whether you see it as you know i'm going

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.560
to take you know i'm going to

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.920
you don't know how good i am at this or

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.839
if you'll see it as a form of worship

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:35.680
that you enjoy is it a bragging boast or

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.600
is it a that's what i'm saying yeah it's

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.680
worth a study maybe to

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.760
we should kind of refresh with this with

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.600
this cool guy exactly how he said it

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.920

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.959
off-putting okay all right it's a red

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.279
count i know

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:10.160
yeah do i make any sounds yeah do i make

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.440
any sounds

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.360
do you make sounds

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.440
um

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.639
i'm trying to think if you have like a

00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:18.639
real distinct

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:20.079
sound

00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:21.519
nothing like the scratching you don't

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:23.040
like it when i go

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.120
when i clear my throat you get really

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.120
upset usually you do you get more upset

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.800
when i do it though well like because

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.560
you go

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.560
you do that like you

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.639
like you you oh it's when you sneeze a

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:36.079
lot you do okay you first of all you

00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:39.880
sneeze in threes

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:43.040
and then you go

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.880
and then you have to scratch the inside

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.360
of your ear and it's so gross and when

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.240
you go hot and sometimes it creates uh

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.639
belches

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:55.920
i sneeze with such violence yeah yeah

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.920
creates an air pocket it's so weird and

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.360
then you're the weirdest thing you do is

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.240
that you somehow belch right when you

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.360
wake up

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.759
like you sit up and then you burp i'm

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:07.759
like you haven't even drank anything you

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:10.720
haven't consumed anything how is it that

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.079
you're burping

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:14.399
it's just cool i'm just cool

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:16.800
people dream to be able to do that

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.480
they do i think somebody's wishing right

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.920
now oh yeah somebody's like god how come

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.759
i don't burp when i wake up

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:23.360
be so cool and then they see me and

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.040
they're like that's [ __ ] awesome man

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.199

it's just weird like anyway yeah and

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.279
then um

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:36.000
man this happened like two weeks ago and

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.839
i still think about it and replay it in

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:39.440
my mind like there's two things i think

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.959
about no three

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:43.680
one time my stepdad when i was like 15 i

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.759
went to go kiss his cheek and then he

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:47.519
turned his head and then we accidentally

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:50.079
mouth-kissed i think about that moment

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:52.399
like all the time

00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:55.040
like he was you know there's that moment

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.639

like [ __ ] i should have just not done

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.360
that that night and then this new moment

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.720
is i went to go take a piss in the

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.120
middle of the night and you had just

and it's dark and i sit down with a

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.600
little bit of force because my ankle is

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.280

how does that happen tell walk me

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.760

noted all right this is um

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.000
a lot of aviation to take him but i

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.320
think i i think i'll maybe uh clip this

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.760
part of the show and you can you know

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.880
reference it when you're making your

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.960
october video

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.200
yeah i mean so you can use it as a

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.839
oh for my my personal yeah yeah so like

00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:28.560
so like practice yeah right

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.680
because this is going to take more than

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.280
one take right sure i mean remember it

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.960
doesn't have to be perfect but you know

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.800
it should be pretty good

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.720
and yeah because the length of the last

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.800
one it's getting longer and it's getting

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.680
better but i'd like to see it double in

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.280
time length it sounds like you've got a

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.599
lot to cover in this october video it

00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:46.880
does sound like a lot yeah it almost

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.160
feels like you should do two videos in

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.720
october oh wow

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.480
oh well october is a longer month

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.720
and i also want you to make sure people

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.280
are safe during halloween

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.040
that's a good point it's a very

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.200
dangerous day

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.079
yeah i hope you have a safe holiday and

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:10.800

00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:06.480
you know that i've been really into for

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.480
a while now chiropractor videos

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.839
it's the oddest thing to enjoy i really

00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:15.359
don't understand

00:42:15.359 --> 00:42:17.599
because i'm i'm wincing the whole time

00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:19.599
and you like it i love it you like them

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:20.480
too

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.240
i hate it yeah i like watching them like

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.680
getting adjustments like i like all of

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.359
it yeah i mean when you watch them

00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:26.880
though i'm like

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.560
and like every crack you're like that's

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.920
got to feel good like i feel it for them

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.280
this though

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.520
this got sent to me quite a bit

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.839
um

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.200
oh they're level

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.839
oh my god

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.440
i legitimately thought

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.760
when this was set up the first time that

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.040
we were going to get someone ripped in

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.200
half too that's drawing and quartering

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.800
they used to do that in medieval period

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.520
yeah horses do you see that uh people

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.480
had

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.480
uh photoshopped um you as the guy no and

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.720
me is the guy pulling the pin yeah yeah

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.400
it's really cool stuff we have the best

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.640
fans

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.119
would you let me do this to you

00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:14.240
i don't know man i don't think he looks

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.680
hurt he doesn't look hurt at all this

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.200
technique looks like it creates more

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.480
problems than it solves it could it

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.560
could hurt yeah but he doesn't look hurt

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.680
right no no but also like it's because

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.839
it's actually i think it's bungee cord

00:43:25.839 --> 00:43:28.400
you know like he bounces it's not just

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.079
like a straight

00:43:30.079 --> 00:43:31.599
wire it's not really a controlled

00:43:31.599 --> 00:43:33.200
adjustment is what you're saying

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.319
it's not

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:35.280
um

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.960
also that's not my problem area my

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.040
problem area is not my entire spine and

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.839
my entire body

00:43:42.079 --> 00:43:43.920
lower back stuff mostly

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.319
i imagine it does feel good can we watch

00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:48.480
it again because first he gets he gets

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.400
stretched and then he goes up so his

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.359
body goes like this and then that right

00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:56.160
so it's kind of a

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.560
this is russian of course

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.560
it's so wild dude but it's got some

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.400
bounce to it which is what i didn't

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.520
didn't know it was happening and they

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.400
all look like they're having a great

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.240
time

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.680
you want to try it

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.119
look man if you want to rig one of these

00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:14.800
contraptions up at the new studio you

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.240
know maybe i'll [ __ ] around on it all

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.800
right oh my god could you imagine by the

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.040
way we didn't get to say um because

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.040
these are obviously being recorded in

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.040
advance but hopefully the live show was

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.280
a blast and i think it was yeah

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.119
we don't know we had a lot of things

00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:31.200
planned a lot i hope they happen i hope

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.720
they happen too

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.160
we've spent a lot of time on that it'd

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.480
be a real weird moment if

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.359
the live show didn't happen but

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:41.119
remember last week

00:44:41.119 --> 00:44:43.839
remember it was pretty damn good yeah

00:44:43.839 --> 00:44:47.440
yeah that was amazing zara face came

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.599
very very cool it was our face

00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:52.319
jessica curson oh my gosh

00:44:52.319 --> 00:44:53.680
i know there's pre-taped segments that

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.040
we've already shot so hopefully those

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.800
went well

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.400
you tased a man

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.560
i think so that was awesome

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.119
i think so tasering i think it was great

00:45:03.119 --> 00:45:05.200
our outfits were great hopefully people

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.680
got disgusted during the heavyweight we

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.160
had very heavy mucho heavy hopefully the

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.079
mariachi band worked out that was fun

00:45:12.079 --> 00:45:14.000
too those guys were great yeah they're

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.160
great we've sampled them so oh yeah they

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:20.079
came to our son's third birthday yeah

00:45:20.079 --> 00:45:21.920
surprisingly easy to get a mariachi band

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.359
to come to your house

00:45:23.359 --> 00:45:26.960
yeah it's very odd not that expensive

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.839
yeah

00:45:27.839 --> 00:45:29.760
would you do this

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.200
no

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.480
i'd pull the pin

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.119
you pull the pen yeah

00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:37.119
i wonder what damage like i wish we

00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:38.800
could have a doctor weigh in on like

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.960
what could potentially go wrong here i

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.560
think i could guess you think you just

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.720
get paralyzed like your neck snaps

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.760
easily right

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.000
you could dislocate some things

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.400
joint damage joints yeah they just rip

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.280
your joints out huh strains damn

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.280

my queen beautiful day i changed my mind

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.800
i want chris larson's video to be like

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.800
this

00:49:19.599 --> 00:49:21.280
i i don't know if i can go up against

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.440
the kings that's a tall order i want the

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.400
chris

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.440
version of this

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.400
i know

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.000
cause here's the thing

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.559
the king's got an element of perviness

00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:37.839
to him

00:49:37.839 --> 00:49:39.280
you know like

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.000
also i don't is beautifulist a word i

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.720
don't think chris you're the smart one

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.640
yeah unlike impactful i don't think this

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.559
is a word oh

00:49:48.559 --> 00:49:51.040
[ __ ] here we go did you also think she

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.640
was fully talked when she was all fired

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.000
up about that yeah no impactful is not a

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.640
[ __ ] word oh my god it's a corporate

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.040
here again the diminutive space no but

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.960
diminutive space is not a work huh uh we

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.040
saw i saw in the comments that uh

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.280
diminutive means small again yes you're

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.960
right but in that context that could be

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.440
enacted the diminutive space the small

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.839
space of this art possibly but we

00:50:17.839 --> 00:50:19.280
created possibly

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.680
i guess but we created it as a saying we

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.720
literally looked up how impactful no

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.240
we're talking about diminutive space but

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.920
you're still saying that impactful is

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.240
not a word i still hate it and i hate it

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.480
going by it's it's a made-up you know

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.040
she made me think that i was crazy right

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.200
this was like a dozen years ago and i

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.559
was like yeah impactful she was like

00:50:38.559 --> 00:50:40.000
that's not a word i was like oh my god

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.920
it's not like a lot of work yeah she's

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.200
really good at that yeah it's a

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.400
corporate world you're real good at

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.599
gaslighting yeah oh my god

00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:49.760
how dare someone claims to read

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.760
but i don't read anymore

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.520
not since i had children i don't read my

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.240
brain is gone what yeah it's clear you

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.839
don't have time to do anything your

00:50:57.839 --> 00:51:00.160
brain is gone yeah no i'm fully [ __ ]

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:03.280
now yeah i 100 agree i think i used to

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.680
be smart and i'm not and that's fine i

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.119
don't care

00:51:07.119 --> 00:51:09.119
i don't miss it i don't miss reading or

00:51:09.119 --> 00:51:11.040
being smarter than i am people are like

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.400
why don't you do that's deep bro anymore

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.480
i'm like i can't read anymore i can't

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.839
read books

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:18.079
nothing in order to meet low emission

00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:20.800
requirements a double vacuum advanced

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.960
distributor has been developed its

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.280
purpose is to assure that the spark will

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.680
be fully [ __ ] when the engine is

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.079
idling

00:51:30.319 --> 00:51:33.040
there is a separate diaphragm and vacuum

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.680
chamber for [ __ ] position that works

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.640
opposite to the advanced diaphragm

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.599
when the throttle is closed a vacuum at

00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:43.040
tube a

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.079
acts on the [ __ ] diaphragm which moves

00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:49.680
the breaker plate to [ __ ] ignition

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.520
i thought you would like that the result

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:52.319
is

00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:54.720
as soon as the throttle is opened

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.200
the advance jumps ahead six to eight

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.839
degrees and when it is closed

00:51:59.839 --> 00:52:02.839
the spark is quickly and fully

00:52:02.839 --> 00:52:06.060
[ __ ] i knew you'd like that

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:09.440
[Laughter]

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.680
that was the best thing ever

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.440
gosh i wonder what year this is it's

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.440
like seven years this is a

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.599
2013.

00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:20.319
that was great throttle closed equals

00:52:20.319 --> 00:52:21.520
what

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.040
yeah

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.880
you like that i did

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.200
i think my throttle is closed

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.839
it's full talked

00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:37.040
but don't don't use it tom yes you mean

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.839
but seriously though do you think having

00:52:39.839 --> 00:52:42.000
too small like maybe just having two

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.160
small kids it has made my brain dumber

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.839
there's things that you just i'm so

00:52:45.839 --> 00:52:46.880
tired

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.359
there's things that you just go like oh

00:52:49.359 --> 00:52:51.680
yeah i have no capacity yeah for

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.000
something anymore yeah yeah like i don't

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.839
we would just laugh and and

00:54:45.839 --> 00:54:48.319
play around and you'd lay on top of me

00:54:48.319 --> 00:54:50.240
and push the air out of my body and

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.119
stuff

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.559
forget that i'm i'm fully [ __ ] so

00:54:58.559 --> 00:55:00.720
i can't those were good times

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.960
yeah i mean it seems like a

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.040
lifetime ago it does it's like asking me

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.880
like do you remember sophomore year of

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.240
high school like that's what i feel like

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.799
you're asking me and i'm like uh i guess

00:55:10.799 --> 00:55:12.240
i know like what did we do before

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.319
children now looking back all that free

00:55:14.319 --> 00:55:16.960
time what the [ __ ] did we do

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:19.599
yeah we just watched tv all day i think

00:55:19.599 --> 00:55:21.280
we watched a lot more television because

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.960
you and i were both lazy like when we

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.359
weren't working we were just hanging out

00:55:25.359 --> 00:55:27.680
yeah we just work we worked a lot yeah

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.440
it's true and we had

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.640
don't forget that it was like we're

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.680
dating

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.920
we have full work schedules like we're

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:34.799
working

00:55:34.799 --> 00:55:37.200
you know eight ten twelve hour days on

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.119
certain things yeah and then doing

00:55:39.119 --> 00:55:40.880
stand-up at night yeah so it all kind of

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.400
just feels like

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.680
it really does feel like remembering

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.720
high school like remember you go to

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.720
school and you had class then you you're

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.799
like yeah i remember we went to parties

00:55:48.799 --> 00:55:50.880
i remember things like but

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.480
where it feels like

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.920
taking up the

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.520
you know the big part of my memory i'm

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:57.599
like god my memories are so stuffed with

00:55:57.599 --> 00:55:59.680
these last five years you know

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.680
this is such a huge change it's such a

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.599
huge change yeah but it's funny because

00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:04.559
i

00:56:04.559 --> 00:56:06.559
it's not funny but i think your mom's

00:56:06.559 --> 00:56:07.599
house

00:56:07.599 --> 00:56:08.880
is

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.359
is from that time

00:56:11.359 --> 00:56:13.520
before children no you're right you know

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.599
you and i probably if i listened to it

00:56:15.599 --> 00:56:17.839
i'd probably like oh yeah you know like

00:56:17.839 --> 00:56:19.760
it would probably spark more memories

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.599
yeah this is our idol time together of

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:22.559

00:58:57.119 --> 00:58:58.559
oh yeah yeah

00:58:58.559 --> 00:59:02.319
what do you think caused it to be so big

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.599
well it wasn't i haven't had that much

00:59:05.599 --> 00:59:06.799
food because i've been watching what

00:59:06.799 --> 00:59:08.559
i've eat but it's just i think

00:59:08.559 --> 00:59:11.040
it was kind of a a blaster you know and

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.880
i'm on the way home

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.240
uh from picking mom up with the doctors

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.640
and then suddenly i gotta go and should

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.559
i stop and do the mcdonald's or

00:59:20.559 --> 00:59:22.559
something well i've done that before and

00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:25.119
somebody's been in the men's room

00:59:25.119 --> 00:59:26.880
and then you really gotta squeeze your

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.040
legs together yeah and a couple times

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:31.359
i've had i've had a little leakage okay

00:59:31.359 --> 00:59:32.400
so

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.240
i i decided

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.079
so i'm getting all the red lights on the

00:59:36.079 --> 00:59:37.920
way home yeah

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.280
and uh i'm squeezing and this and that

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.680
it comes and goes and finally

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.240
finally i get into the house and you

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.400
know

00:59:48.799 --> 00:59:50.319
and turn it around sometimes that

00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:52.160
happens because relax your muscles when

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.200
you turn around get the toilet and broom

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.720

00:59:59.359 --> 01:00:01.359
room with you recently and

01:00:01.359 --> 01:00:02.240
after

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.000
you used the toilet

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.240
the entire

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.599
underside

01:00:07.599 --> 01:00:09.040
of the

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.760
of the toilet and the rim of the toilet

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.000
and then even some on the seat had [ __ ]

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.760
in it

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.440
i know well you know i got a different

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.359
nozzle than you do yeah

01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:20.240
i mean

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.839
uh yeah sometimes they go like that and

01:00:23.839 --> 01:00:25.760
you know i guess you're supposed to

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.440
clean them up afterwards but i forget

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.640
sometimes

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.799
yeah no i noticed that um

01:00:30.799 --> 01:00:33.119
so what i wanted to ask you about was

01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:35.520
i went through the unique experience

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.839
of having you text me

01:00:37.839 --> 01:00:41.040
photos that i didn't know what they were

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.839
and then yeah you called me later and

01:00:43.839 --> 01:00:46.000
you're like did you get what i sent you

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.720
and i go yeah and you go that's

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:51.200
that's the uh space between my scrotum

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.480
and my anus

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.040
and i have it oh yeah oh yeah

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.640
yeah yeah

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.799
yeah this was this is a problem

01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:00.640
this was a problem that goes back to a

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.799
year ago and i got like a little

01:01:02.799 --> 01:01:04.799
infection

01:01:04.799 --> 01:01:06.240
in there i don't know a pimple or

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.400
something and i think what happens in

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.480
fact you know what happens i took a

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.440
really big hard [ __ ] in my skin stretch

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.520
i think i i cracked

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.599
and so it got infected

01:01:17.599 --> 01:01:19.520
went to the doctor

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.400
and uh you know it never really healed

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.400
up and then on mother's day when we were

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.480
down in west palm beach with you yeah um

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:31.760
i had like a boil down there okay

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.599
oh my goodness

01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:34.799
so

01:01:34.799 --> 01:01:37.920
i went you know i went to the doctor and

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.520
he said

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.599
explain the history

01:01:41.599 --> 01:01:43.559
different i went to different doctor

01:01:43.559 --> 01:01:46.000
dermatologists and he said you know you

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.520
got to get that looked at so i went to

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.359
see my buddy uh the surgeon and

01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:54.720
you know he explained to me that

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.839
probably the best thing to do is slice

01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:58.640
that

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.680
place open because what happened was

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.880
the infection over repeated infection it

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.000
was like a tunnel under the skin

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.200
if you think

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.119
but it's just bored like a towel you

01:02:11.119 --> 01:02:13.039
know what the neat thing is is that

01:02:13.039 --> 01:02:15.119
i get to hear the explanation but also

01:02:15.119 --> 01:02:16.559
see the photos

01:02:16.559 --> 01:02:19.440
of my dad's teeth yeah

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.280
yeah yeah because you could just tell me

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.119
my boy but i i am glad that no no i

01:02:25.119 --> 01:02:27.839
no i i i'm you know i'm i'm you're my

01:02:27.839 --> 01:02:30.319
son and i believe in full disclosure and

01:02:30.319 --> 01:02:32.240
mom mom said that she was really

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.680
thrilled to be your photographer that

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.760
you would hold your legs up in the

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.160
change my die die position and that she

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.920
would take photos and then show them to

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.119
you and you're like no that's not good

01:02:41.119 --> 01:02:43.039
enough take another one so she had to

01:02:43.039 --> 01:02:44.640
repeatedly

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.839
and they were well she took multiple

01:02:46.839 --> 01:02:49.440
photos what's that she said well-lit

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.440
well-lit photos

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.520
oh yeah well she you know she builds

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.079
herself as an expert cell phone

01:02:56.079 --> 01:02:58.799
photographer if there is such a thing

01:02:58.799 --> 01:03:00.559
and

01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:02.559
so she wanted to make sure it was just

01:03:02.559 --> 01:03:04.960
right yeah and actually i got it kind of

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.119
a history on this but it's still

01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:09.680
it's still not healed it's doctor says

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.079
it might take three months to heal

01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:14.079
a lot of people are asking me if i can

01:03:14.079 --> 01:03:15.680
if i can share your photos can i share

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.319
those photos

01:03:18.319 --> 01:03:20.640
oh i don't care absolutely do you want

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:24.000
can i post them on instagram

01:03:25.119 --> 01:03:27.920
well i'm not an instagram guy okay no i

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.680
know you're not i'm asking you if i can

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.680
well you can do yeah you can if you want

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.319
to sure okay sure it means

01:03:36.319 --> 01:03:38.240
it could be educational for people i

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.319
think they would really like that

01:03:40.319 --> 01:03:42.160
because you also showed me like

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.160
i think there was some like some pre-op

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.319
photos and then the stitches and then

01:03:46.319 --> 01:03:48.880
some post stitches well the stitches

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.280
well when i took my first big stitch a

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.599
[ __ ] one of the stitches popped oh no

01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:57.599
yeah yeah

01:03:57.599 --> 01:03:59.839
so that's why it kind of opened there

01:03:59.839 --> 01:04:02.160
and the doctor says it might take

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:05.039
three months to heal oh my god it sounds

01:04:05.039 --> 01:04:07.359
like an episiotomy like after i had my

01:04:07.359 --> 01:04:09.359
babies yeah but he's saying it's kind of

01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:10.400
like it

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.559
it's kind of like an episiotomy very

01:04:12.559 --> 01:04:14.880
yeah see christina you know she's he

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.599
knows his stuff yeah absolutely

01:04:17.599 --> 01:04:19.920
and uh you know it kind of made me

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.599
appreciate what women go through in

01:04:21.599 --> 01:04:23.119
childbirth

01:04:23.119 --> 01:04:25.920
well listen because it sounds like you

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.799
you tore your taint browning is what

01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:30.160
you're telling yeah he pushed his own

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.200
baby out yeah yeah yeah so yeah i did i

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.039
mean it it's uh

01:04:35.039 --> 01:04:36.960
and you know

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.880
i go through all kinds of cycles with

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.280
you know with my disease and gi problems

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.440
and stuff so every once in a while i get

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.119
you know a true brick okay right and uh

01:04:47.119 --> 01:04:48.799
it really stretches things and that

01:04:48.799 --> 01:04:51.359
that's kind of what started this and um

01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:52.799
so i hope you're

01:04:52.799 --> 01:04:53.760
because i don't want you to have

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.920
something like that happen again staying

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.920
hydrated i know you're not a big

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:01.440

and then you drink a diet coke doesn't

01:05:45.839 --> 01:05:49.359

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.520
so is your is your taint is your

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.520
perineum the the space between your

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.359
scrotum and your anus bothering you like

01:05:59.359 --> 01:06:00.880
day to day like right now is it

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.720
sensitive

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.400
well it's it's it's

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.319
it let's put it this way you know it's

01:06:06.319 --> 01:06:07.119
there

01:06:07.119 --> 01:06:08.640
but it doesn't really hurt because i'm

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.000
kind of careful

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.400
and you know when i sit down

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.480
watch tv i kind of lean to one side of

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.240
the other and then when i get out of the

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.799
car yeah i have to squeeze my cheeks

01:06:18.799 --> 01:06:20.480
together so i don't hit the top of the

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.400
seat doesn't rub in the middle there

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.920
yeah also toddler skill that's a skill

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.520
skill set that i've learned that is a

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.760
nice also you may want to try some coal

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.240

that i have that and i have uh

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.880
metamucil fiber capsules so capsules are

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.200
a lot easier than the pills that'll help

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.440
and and try to lay out in the powder and

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.359

that's going to make it ache try to lay

01:06:49.599 --> 01:06:51.520
down yeah so i just

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.559

another [ __ ] hilarious sketch show

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.520
yeah i mean john mckeever made because i

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.280

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.440
dating yeah yeah yeah

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.199
dude and you know what i was fun i don't

01:13:15.199 --> 01:13:17.199

01:13:17.199 --> 01:13:19.199
you know bits for the from that special

01:13:19.199 --> 01:13:21.280
but you make you address the fact that

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.520
you're like i figured out how to do

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.120
trump yeah yeah and the special and

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.280
because when i when i message you you

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.719
know i think when you watch a sketch

01:13:28.719 --> 01:13:30.480
where someone's going to do trump or an

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:33.120
impression you're like this is a this is

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.640
going to be a high risk reward kind of

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.880
thing because he's become such a you

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.360
know he's like a caricature of a person

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.480
but you did find you did nail it in that

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.320
you got down a lot of people were doing

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.520
trump stuff weren't doing the hand

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.960
things yeah that's all you got to do

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.199
yeah i don't even sound that much like

01:13:49.199 --> 01:13:51.120
him but it really feels like yeah yeah

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.000
yeah

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.840
i kind of yeah as soon as i i still have

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.760
like i have like the small hands

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.800
i look like like physically my body

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.120
is very similar and he always did the

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.280
hands yeah and then he comments on what

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.560
he just said

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.159
so that's my president y'all yeah it's

01:14:06.159 --> 01:14:07.040
my friend

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.199
that's my guy dude

01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:11.040
so many people still do that because you

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.960
nailed it too in that

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.800
it's like you almost

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.040
i think people were so worked up about

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.199
him you know yeah which i i fully

01:14:19.199 --> 01:14:20.960
understand i mean i'm sure i was like

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:23.040
this guy's out of his bonkers dude he's

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.760
so crazy our president was wild yeah

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.880
he's doing that yeah 911. he has he has

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.960
done nothing that presidents do

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.400
you know i mean like

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.800
who like you can't even like now

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.480
we have a little more perspective the

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.800
fact that a president was just like no

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.239
more press briefings

01:14:40.239 --> 01:14:42.640
what yeah yeah like that is a thing

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.800
it's a staple of an american presidency

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.640
is that you have some transparency or at

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:49.440
least attempt to have somewhere you go

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:50.880
we're gonna here's what's going on yeah

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.480
we're gonna feel he was like [ __ ] him

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.520
yeah yeah i don't like him they don't

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.600
like they don't like me i don't like

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.760
them yeah it's crazy it's good to have a

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.320
petty president yeah super i like you

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.239

01:17:06.159 --> 01:17:08.080
no he doesn't he's just a bully yeah but

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.840
that's more entertaining than a debate

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.159
exactly i'd rather watch a bully a groan

01:17:12.159 --> 01:17:14.719
a 70 year old bully yeah versus 70 year

01:17:14.719 --> 01:17:16.480
old dorks yeah

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.199

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.520
the how fragile and it's like you know

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.400
just pathetic a system we have yeah for

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.199
sure

01:17:29.199 --> 01:17:30.880
i always think about too that like i was

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.239
just talking about this

01:17:32.239 --> 01:17:33.040
how

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.120
every election you know this country is

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.679
amazing like the innovation the minds of

01:17:37.679 --> 01:17:40.800
like that what we have come up with yeah

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.640
it's just incredible like i mean in

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.719
every in every field and then every

01:17:44.719 --> 01:17:46.080
election cycle you're like this is the

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.000
group yeah yeah this is the page

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.840
unbelievable why don't we have one of

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.960
these

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.360
[ __ ] brilliant minds decide to do

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.120
this job i've said this before

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.840
philosopher king

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.300
yeah you guys were like

01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.840
[Music]

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.320
no philosopher king but i mean it's just

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.800
like at least i think that goes bad

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.800
i think that goes bad yeah i know i know

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.159
yeah i think every once while the

01:18:08.159 --> 01:18:10.800
philosopher is a [ __ ] idiot

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.560
yeah they don't have life experience but

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.480
my philosopher king would be raised from

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.800
birth to lead so they would there's some

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.760
dalai lama

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:20.239
that she or he had isn't that the dalai

01:18:20.239 --> 01:18:22.400
lama basically is that the dalai lama

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.159
kind of the spiritual leader though that

01:18:24.159 --> 01:18:25.760
person what i'm saying same principle

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.360
right like as a child or something

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.320
they're like

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.800
that person emerges as such they're not

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.880
raised as such so meaning like

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.679
some kid somewhere will show signs of

01:18:35.679 --> 01:18:36.800
being the dalai lama and they're like

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.320
that guy it's that that's him it's the

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.760
reincarnated

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.679
lovable spiritual leader okay and then

01:18:41.679 --> 01:18:44.080
they go instead of hey working tom sugar

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.760
and christine p are going to make a baby

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.679
that kid's going to raise he'll be

01:18:47.679 --> 01:18:49.360
raised to be a leader of the free world

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.800
this is going to backfire oh it's a

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.239
great idea i don't know if that's how

01:18:52.239 --> 01:18:53.360
people work

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.040
that's how my people work i'm raising

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.480
them right now i'm raising kids right

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.000
now to be the leader let me say

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.360
something i live with those two kids and

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.239
neither one of them is going to be the

01:19:00.239 --> 01:19:02.239
[ __ ] philosopher that's for sure i

01:19:02.239 --> 01:19:03.600

from the seminal nation

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.639
so it's it's different like a couple

01:25:24.639 --> 01:25:26.159
years ago when this started when they

01:25:26.159 --> 01:25:28.639

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:34.719
to the seminoles and i was like this is

01:25:34.719 --> 01:25:36.639
not this gonna backfire yeah because

01:25:36.639 --> 01:25:38.560
they have they've had a partnership for

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.360

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.920
a [ __ ] eight spots a night guy like

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:32.960
everybody

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.719
yeah i try to yeah yeah but it's all

01:28:34.719 --> 01:28:36.480
these it's usually just the stand in the

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:37.760
cellar those are the two those are the

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.679
two i do yeah because i do the road i do

01:28:39.679 --> 01:28:41.199
the road every

01:28:41.199 --> 01:28:43.199
weekend you do i'm only in new york like

01:28:43.199 --> 01:28:45.040
two or three days a week just doing the

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.960
road yeah good

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.320
way to do it that's fine it's the way to

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.000
do it yeah that's the way to do it

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.080
it's funny when you see comics that stay

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.199
in the city

01:28:53.199 --> 01:28:54.719
and then they're like oh where have you

01:28:54.719 --> 01:28:56.480
been when you get to the club it's like

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:57.440
uh

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.280
it's doing our what we do for a little

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.360
job yeah the job but you know what ends

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.120
up happening i mean i i remember this

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.800
from when i first started doing that

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.840
yeah

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.880
is that you then do sets

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:09.679
and

01:29:09.679 --> 01:29:11.360
look there's just no other way to

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.360
describe it your sets end up being

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.320
better

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:15.679
because you're

01:29:15.679 --> 01:29:17.120
you're performing

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.639
all over the country

01:29:18.639 --> 01:29:21.120
and then it starts to stand out like how

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.719
come your sets are your [ __ ] so much

01:29:22.719 --> 01:29:25.199
tighter it's like because i'm touring

01:29:25.199 --> 01:29:26.320
all the time yeah because i just

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.639
performed in a tent in lafayette yeah

01:29:28.639 --> 01:29:30.080
yeah right

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:33.760
and then those people still don't leave

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:35.199
and you're like

01:29:35.199 --> 01:29:36.960
well how come you're

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.920
how come your stand-up never progresses

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:42.560
because you sit here that's why

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.560
you sit here that's so true the big city

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:47.360
comic who never leaves is its own brand

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:50.400
of stand-up right like yeah that that

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:51.440
comic could

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:54.159
appeal to a very narrow demographic and

01:29:54.159 --> 01:29:55.840
they could have a great career in you

01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:58.400
know writing for tv or films or whatever

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.960
but it's still like a very narrow

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.960
thing you got to go out you got to be

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.520
able to do it the whole country yeah and

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.360
and understand what what's going on the

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.520
best comics are comics that do stand up

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:11.520
to the most um like amount of people

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.840
yeah or like the most variety of people

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:16.159
and do tense and lafayette yeah yeah

01:30:16.159 --> 01:30:17.600
this way i wanted to show you this so

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.719
that you

01:30:18.719 --> 01:30:22.080
are you know just like well informed

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:25.360
i just added bug to my list of pronouns

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.280
so here is a very quick tutorial on how

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.520
to use bug bugs pronouns

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.199
in sentences

01:30:31.199 --> 01:30:32.480
okay let's go

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.719
i'm meeting up with my friend moth later

01:30:34.719 --> 01:30:37.280
uh bug just dyed bug's hair and it's a

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.520
super cool green color right now

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.679
i think we're gonna go to bug's house

01:30:41.679 --> 01:30:43.520
and play some video games

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:46.239
and then i think bug said

01:30:46.239 --> 01:30:48.159
that bug wanted to go to the store by

01:30:48.159 --> 01:30:49.440
bug self

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.840
i'm done i'm done

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.480
i'm done dude if my kid [ __ ] grows up

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.400
and makes these tech talks i will beat

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.320
the [ __ ] out of that hey

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:01.040
he can take his head and beat it on the

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.920
desk and i don't care

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.560
i don't like it

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.400
what would your dad say if he stopped by

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:13.040
if my dad saw this yeah

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.400
i can tell you exactly what he would do

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.679
if you played that for my dad he'd go

01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:17.040
what the hell

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.199
that's it that's as far as he could go

01:31:19.199 --> 01:31:20.639
[ __ ] is this

01:31:20.639 --> 01:31:22.400
he would just be this is a different

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.880
planet i'm i'm losing touch with this

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.960
this is you know what i mean yeah it's a

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.560

don't get it because it's

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:34.560
almost

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.480
to a degree i think you kind of go like

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.800
oh i get i get what's happening with

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.560

01:31:42.239 --> 01:31:44.560
like wait you're bug

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.320
my favorite is uh you want to go buy bug

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.560
self to the store

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:51.760

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.440
with like a hillbilly accent it makes

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.199
perfect sense yeah i think we're going

01:31:55.199 --> 01:31:57.040
to go to bug's house play some video

01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:58.960

01:32:04.719 --> 01:32:06.560
bug's not that person's bugs

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.560
yeah i don't think this person is

i think

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.679
a lot of these are just people with

01:32:11.679 --> 01:32:14.159

to me like this person wants a cool

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:31.040

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:33.040
we have to conjugate yeah but you can't

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.360
give yourself the cool nickname exactly

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.560

01:35:28.159 --> 01:35:29.920
real competition between california and

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:32.480
texas it's grown there there's a rivalry

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:34.400

difference in weird guys yeah so

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.880
weirdness so there's a california

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.480
weirdness right where you walk through

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.920

i just like it yeah i don't know what it

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.000

six weeks up to six weeks six weeks

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.040
which is nothing because you really

don't know you're pregnant until about

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.440
six weeks so the heartbeat kicks in and

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.440
that's usually right when women fight i

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:31.679

the doctor's heads who perform the

yeah yeah put our own money into it see

01:52:39.679 --> 01:52:40.880
what happens you had great like

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:42.239
supporting

01:52:42.239 --> 01:52:44.000
actors yeah those are all philly guys

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.119
they were great yeah like i um i saw a

01:52:47.119 --> 01:52:48.880
bunch of the sketches you know the blind

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:52.239
one the the only fan's dad um but i was

01:52:52.239 --> 01:52:54.400
you know i got i watched the trump

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:56.800
dating one like 25 times that was dude

01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:58.560
that was great like while we were

01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.400

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.239
so i had like the hands yeah and it

01:53:02.239 --> 01:53:03.920
explained all of his movements yeah

01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:05.679
cause like if your hand is spray tanned

01:53:05.679 --> 01:53:07.360
like that you can't like put it in your

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:08.639
pockets or anything oh right so when

01:53:08.639 --> 01:53:10.159
you're standing you always have to be

01:53:10.159 --> 01:53:12.239
kind of like lurched forward with your

01:53:12.239 --> 01:53:14.480
hands like out of your pockets

it makes look at him there he is all of

01:53:16.719 --> 01:53:18.800
his movements make perfect sense if

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:21.040
you're the top of your hands are

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:23.679

01:53:23.679 --> 01:53:24.880
it's such

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:26.400
all the movements

01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:27.920
are like keeping his hands away from

01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:29.520
like his sleeves and

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:32.239

01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.800
funny yeah sure yeah pretty funny

01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:16.320
yeah he deserves it for doing what he

01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:16.980
was doing

01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:21.500
[Music]

01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:23.760
see i think if he would have just stayed

01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:25.040
in the sea to be fine he'd just be

01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:27.280
laying on his side you know

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:28.639
it was trying to

01:57:28.639 --> 01:57:30.639
jump out and then it the weight of it on

01:57:30.639 --> 01:57:33.920
top of them that yes broke a leg or two

01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:35.440
do you guys want to hear just a horrible

01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:36.880
story sure

01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:40.800
um so i i was at the airport and um

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.800
someone told me a story there's a 911

01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:43.640
was it

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:45.840
[Laughter]

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:47.840
but it was at atlanta airport and um i

01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:49.119
was like have you ever seen anybody get

01:57:49.119 --> 01:57:50.400
killed on the runway because like

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.239
there's all these cars and [ __ ] and like

01:57:52.239 --> 01:57:53.679
traffic on the runway and he goes

01:57:53.679 --> 01:57:56.239
actually yeah there was a silent plane

01:57:56.239 --> 01:57:58.560
this old brazilian plane he said i don't

01:57:58.560 --> 01:57:59.760
know what that means but he said the

01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.520
propellers are silent

01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:04.080
and so this plane landed at night and it

01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:07.119
was a silent propeller and a guy who was

01:58:07.119 --> 01:58:09.520
on you know the tarmac or whatever like

01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:12.719
um driving a golf cart didn't see or

01:58:12.719 --> 01:58:15.199
hear the plane and then went right into

01:58:15.199 --> 01:58:18.400
the propeller and got ground up and died

01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:21.920
now isn't that a wild story

01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:22.800
yeah

01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:24.719
yeah i didn't know that people died that

01:58:24.719 --> 01:58:26.880
way

01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:30.880
that's a rough way to go though yeah is

01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:33.360
it he was probably like no no it's not

01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:35.119
probably call yeah didn't see didn't

01:58:35.119 --> 01:58:36.880
even hear it coming it was just life was

01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:39.599
just over for that guy yeah it's like uh

01:58:39.599 --> 01:58:41.280
gone it's like when the nightstalk i

01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:42.960
tried to say this when he was shooting

01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:44.719
people in their sleep oh

01:58:44.719 --> 01:58:46.880
god please what's the fun in that i know

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:49.280
please let me go that way yeah just get

01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:50.960
my head blown off while i'm sleeping

01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:51.920
yeah

01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:53.760
and your sleep is the best way to go i

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:54.800
know

01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:57.040
yeah yeah [ __ ]

01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:59.760
but yeah ground up by a silent providing

01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:02.159
plane jesus i wonder if he was done with

01:59:02.159 --> 01:59:03.760
work or just started that makes a little

01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:05.440
bit

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:07.679
if he was working the night shift

01:59:07.679 --> 01:59:09.119
at least he didn't have to work that day

01:59:09.119 --> 01:59:10.880
yeah but he might have been happier if

01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:12.320
he was like alright tonight we're about

01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:13.440

01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:16.159
driving the cart the breeze yeah good

01:59:16.159 --> 01:59:18.800
and then just hear it

01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:21.280

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:32.719
dove

02:01:32.719 --> 02:01:34.639
the trampoline there's one

02:01:34.639 --> 02:01:37.800

02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:55.040
worse than an acl tear

02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:57.760

when people are leg pressing

02:02:16.239 --> 02:02:19.119
and it goes back no it's

02:02:19.119 --> 02:02:21.199
because it just comes down to their legs

02:02:21.199 --> 02:02:23.040
just both their legs just bend straight

02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:23.679
out

02:02:23.679 --> 02:02:24.960

and turn to my left to find this that

02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:58.719
could be anywhere where we live in tejas

02:13:58.719 --> 02:14:00.880
it's probably florida i'm guessing oh

02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:04.400
[ __ ] that's a swamp type

02:14:04.719 --> 02:14:06.400
of place

02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:07.840
look at that dude that's just for those

02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:10.159
of you just listening that is a snake

02:14:10.159 --> 02:14:13.760
coming out of the spice aisle at the heb

02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:15.199
that would tear that that was terrifying

02:14:15.199 --> 02:14:17.280
terrifying especially because you you

02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:18.800
get scared and you go oh that's a prank

02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:20.239

02:14:20.239 --> 02:14:21.520
closer

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:24.239
and then actual just liquid [ __ ] just

02:14:24.239 --> 02:14:26.320

portion

02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:02.560
yeah yeah

02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:04.960
so there is this thing in um

02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:07.040
kink culture in the uk i think it's

02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:08.560
called sploshing

02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:11.920
where they do like to put food and stuff

02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:13.440
on their body so i don't know this could

02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:16.480
be sploshing adjacent i'm thinking

02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:18.960
but who knows

02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:21.360
covered in food yeah that's reminded me

02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:22.719
of especially because she's obviously

02:15:22.719 --> 02:15:24.960
english

02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:27.040
i didn't pick that up yeah oh now you

02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:28.480
mentioned it it makes sense well i don't

02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:30.239
know i thought maybe that's how she got

02:15:30.239 --> 02:15:33.679
inspired is maybe sploshing i don't know

02:15:33.679 --> 02:15:35.440
yeah i think she's got some other things

02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:36.400
going on

02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:39.119
i think she does but what guys

nice touch

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.679
so i had a really hard time choosing

02:17:09.679 --> 02:17:11.280
which talk because

02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:14.479
the audio is all bad they're too long he

02:17:14.479 --> 02:17:16.319
doesn't get to the [ __ ] point but i

02:17:16.319 --> 02:17:18.240
wanted to showcase this talent because

02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:20.800
this one's very special and you know

02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:22.399

world

02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:27.499
[Music]

02:17:28.639 --> 02:17:30.160
behind him he's gonna sit right on my

02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:32.000
leg

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.200

person but that's okay

02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:56.160
me because i'm a lot more overly

02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:57.920
sensitive and more concerned than i am

02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:01.120
with just the fabric ones like catalina

02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:02.160

something a lot more like i guess the

02:18:03.599 --> 02:18:07.439
