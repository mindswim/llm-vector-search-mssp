00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.119
wrong direction yeah that won't squash

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.360
any hope of love of actual love no i'm

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.040
telling it's already the wrong direction

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.520
right

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.720
why is it the wrong direction tell you

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.560
when they get back why say it now yeah

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.680
say it now

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.400
because she said that she was like oh my

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.119
god

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.479
uh becky asked me yeah if jacob and liz

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.119
uh had anything going on whoa which uh

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.479
she was interested i was like

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.640
i'm like no come on shut up get out she

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.840
goes she kept trying to buy him shots

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.520
tonight but i know what liz is doing liz

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.000
is like

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
yeah [ __ ] with jacob trying to get

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.960
him hammered because that would be

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.759
hilarious

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.240
that's what you're doing it's nothing uh

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.000
sexual for sure

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.640
well we just know liz yeah and uh but

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.759
becky said that

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.520
about j asked about that because there

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.280
was a thing and i'm like man that stinks

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.640
because jacob definitely

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.680
if he was going to hit on someone in

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.880
that situation i have to assume it'd be

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.079
becky sure

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.759
so i don't know it's all going wrong but

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.280
why is that going the wrong way

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.560
because becky's already like yeah

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.000
jacob's got another thing he thought

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.920
like jacob she thought jacob's into it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.239
too

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.560
like jacob's in the that's the wrong

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.599
direction i was there

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.720
they're putting out heavy vibes

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.760
jacob was looking he was cool dude

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.160
but he was cool into who i i just to he

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.040
was sitting with liz

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.319
the whole time and you think he was i'll

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.480

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.520
start tickling someone if you're just

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.880
getting the [ __ ] beat out of you and you

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.919
just get one hand

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.440
here's the thing if you go for the

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.680
tickle and that person's not ticklish

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.440
you are going to get the [ __ ] get that

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.560
you're going to feel like an idiot on

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.880
top

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.319
yeah he's going to put some cheese it

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.919

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:26.000
tickling oh his nose just got broken

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.080
i was just smashing his face everyone

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.520
knows he doesn't have nerve endings in

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.479
his armpits

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:33.039
that was a bad move on moore's end or he

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.039
gets tickled and pees and then furiously

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:35.919
beats the show

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.759
that's the that's my fear with you

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:39.199
because if i get him

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:40.479
if i'd make him piss he's going to

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:41.840
attack and it's going to be like it's

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.520
going to be like that like uh like the

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.720
kid in the school

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.720

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.479
piss and i'm gonna be on top of you

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:49.759
hitting and crying at the same time it's

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:52.639
like that old colorado proverb

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.400
make a bear piss and it'll eat your

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.639
goddamn face all right they asked you

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:57.599
not to make me

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:00.160
feel is you not to me no i think i think

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.960
you'd straight go

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.720

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.680
be like shane's like hell yeah anyway

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.319
like passing you back oh you didn't do

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:09.039
that

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:13.599
laugh oh and then jay would just be like

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:16.160
i would still win the war yeah why

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.440
because you got him to piss if i got

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.240
even if

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.160
if the story the story i would just i

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.440
would just quote myself

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.560
doesn't matter what i did to shane if

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.240
the story comes out you're right the win

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.599
is definitely that he got me to piss all

walk through some portal

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.080
and it would be the old west but because

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.950
you want to own slaves

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.559

you've said that several times on fire

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.840
you said your favorite time in history

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.520
was when you could own slaves

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.960

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.440
have to own slaves

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.080

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:46.640
rocky mountain push

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.919
yeah that's what you'd [ __ ] up if you

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.360

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.480
no man i said i would be you know

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.360
looking i'll probably

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.480
lose staring at you because he wants to

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.400
see if you're being honest or not

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.480
would you still go back to the old west

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.440
i wouldn't go

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.120
because i don't want to go back before

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.720
like toothpaste i realized

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.000
i would have said you know i was a tv

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.600
like in the movies you you never they

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.320
never discuss

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.480
how wretched people's breath are sure

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.600
and they have great teeth

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.200
but they didn't i guess there's ways

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.400
in fact what i mean when was toothpaste

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.840
like in the 50s i think i'd go back to

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.559
1971.

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:22.080
really came out in the 50s maybe

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.480
30s or 40s they discovered fluoride i

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.000
think but when did toothpaste come out

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.440
so you're saying people in the 20s just

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.600
had rank breath i think they were

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.520

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.880

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.039
fluoride toothpaste was this fluoride

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:38.320

yeah it's like everybody knew

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.600
i went way high it's just so the guy

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.360
would have to go sort of low on me and

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.080
it's like

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.760
i got him close enough to like my thighs

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.360
i just said my knee was [ __ ] and i

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.559
wasn't supposed to play anyway because

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.480
of my knees so i faked it to get on and

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:22.960
then

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.520
told the truth to get out so funny i was

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.720
like i really can't

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.200

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.399

00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:32.159
that day literally the the solution for

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:34.080
my knee is ice big j

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.200
had exactly one play in football

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.399
the greatest play of all time

00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:42.240
dashing to the left the running back out

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.520
in the field jay ran

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.760
went high the guard going low fake

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.320
jay once again i'm telling you i just

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.760
complete i would just try to block the

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.360
guy in front of me i hated it being on

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.480
offensive line

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.440
i thought that's where they put all the

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.760
[ __ ] heads i had such an idiot coach

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.600
i was the tall skinny kid and he put me

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.600
at center how bad of a coach you have to

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.640
be yeah

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.399
in sixth grade i called my dad yeah it's

00:28:04.399 --> 00:28:05.679
just ridiculous it's not making me the

00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:06.320
quarterback

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.520
well that's crazy you should have been

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.320
qb one oh you got right

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.760
just walking on to the team being like

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.240
yep dude

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.440
in high school they should have put me

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.520
instead of that kid they had

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.200
you know whatever kurt anderson would

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.720
have perfect dude it would have been so

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.240
funny if you named like as someone

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.679
that's like he's like chad pennington

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:26.559
you're like yeah what should this guy do

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:27.120
yeah

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.360
joseph flacco joey so you you should

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.120
have done what uh what sunshine did

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.559
and remember the titans you remember

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:34.159
that he just walks off

00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:36.399
he walks out he's like i'm a quarterback

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:38.240
all black dudes make fun of him

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.679
he throws a ball at one of the black

00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:41.120
guys yeah and then they're like oh

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.240
you're the starter

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.960
so i just like

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.080
i don't know how you feel about uh doing

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.120
a little 7b7 out in the yard

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.200
oh all those movies where they take kids

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.159

show they're all good people i mean

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.679
greater iron gang is probably the best

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:09.039
of those as far as

00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:10.880
because it's football but it is funny

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.240
there's always the one kid who's like a

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.760
rare talent that just

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.360

00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:21.599
some capacity it was like in the

00:53:21.599 --> 00:53:23.359

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.800

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.040
horrible so like every

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:56.800
twice a week maybe once a week but have

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.880

how

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.640
if here's yeah let it go because the

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:01.760
thing is i don't know i told you i grew

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.200
a mustache

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.200
if i shave my face bald if i shave my

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.680
face bald which i won't but if i did

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.040
no way but if i did that would be a bet

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.599
i bet that i'd shave my facial hair off

00:54:13.599 --> 00:54:14.960
tonight i beat you guys but i wouldn't

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.480
do it for 20 points i'd say i beat you

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.119
for sure

00:54:17.119 --> 00:54:20.240
okay no one beats me definitely a deal

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:25.839
i'll grow my [ __ ] mustache out do it

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.119
how passive aggressive was that you feel

00:54:37.119 --> 00:54:39.200
it then when she said it i do love you i

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.640
love the beard though so

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.400
don't do anything so you're not willing

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.839
to risk that he does long hair and he

00:54:43.839 --> 00:54:45.359
cut his hair and i love his short hair

00:54:45.359 --> 00:54:47.119
so i think he's good

00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:48.079
he's putting the beard on the line

00:54:48.079 --> 00:54:50.160

shane and jay on the beard game i'll get

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.559
this

00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:56.799
terms dude set the difficulty to pro so

00:55:56.799 --> 00:55:58.319
the computer can't play defense for you

00:55:58.319 --> 00:55:59.599
the whole [ __ ] time

00:55:59.599 --> 00:56:01.920
what set the set the difficulty to pro

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.440
all that means is just easier to hit

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:04.319
shots

00:56:04.319 --> 00:56:07.200
yes and the computer's easier to beat i

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.920
got to beat the computer to beat you

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.200
you don't play defense of course

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.359
computer players

00:56:13.359 --> 00:56:14.480
you are defending him because you do the

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.079
same [ __ ] thing but i'm telling you i

00:56:16.079 --> 00:56:18.160
play defense

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.760
i like playing the game i play off the

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.319
ball do you [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:56:22.319 --> 00:56:23.920
i play off the ball guard defense and by

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.000
the way it's not fully true because

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.599
i try to steal the inbound and i play

00:56:27.599 --> 00:56:28.960
your guy up but then i know how to

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.240
switch because i'm playing the passing

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.440
lanes what's wrong with that

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.960
i say it's talking like a real [ __ ]

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.559
haman right now

00:56:34.559 --> 00:56:36.640
i play the passing lanes after that it's

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.280
basketball and then i go over here

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.880
and he comes up and i do it i take it

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.839
back oh beard's on the line difficulties

00:56:42.839 --> 00:56:45.119
pro i haven't agreed any of these terms

00:56:45.119 --> 00:56:46.240
why

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.599
the difficulty definitely not on pro

00:56:47.599 --> 00:56:49.760
it's just boring yeah you gotta go all

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.240
star

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.760
you gotta go all-star at least i'll do

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.280
all-star if we risk the beard

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.799
yeah put the beard on the line dude put

00:56:54.799 --> 00:56:56.799
it out there because then if you beat

00:56:56.799 --> 00:56:58.960
shane he has to grow his facial hair for

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.920
four weeks no shaving boy no shaving

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.680
that's a terrible bet for me because i'm

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:06.559
probably gonna lose there's a spread

00:57:06.559 --> 00:57:07.599
then if we're doing that

00:57:07.599 --> 00:57:10.400
no no jay's gonna shave his beard dude

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:13.839
he's going to the festival you know

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.839
