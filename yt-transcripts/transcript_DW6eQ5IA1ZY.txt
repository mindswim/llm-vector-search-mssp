God yeah I don't think he was gonna yeah

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.010
that was gonna be November I doubt the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.620
cure is now just total civil unrest

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.690
oh speaking of civil war I just my mom

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.100
literally just handed me a very

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.989
problematic drawing I drew when I was a

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.130
boy what it's this is I was a big fan of

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.610
Gettysburg this is uh pretty sick but

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.299
that that's a problem dude you drew the

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.090
Stars and Bars breath sure the mugging

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:21.519
could verify just a swastika running

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.870
with a confederate flag they they just

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.480
killed the white guy someone did have a

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.510
top hat the one picture those I used to

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.320
be a big fan of the Civil War hat so

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.959
yeah is that Abe uh what he's got is oh

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.329
that's definitely a rifle in his hand

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.500
you might have been a sharpshooter to be

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.519
honest I was a big fan of the

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:54.090
sharpshooters it was the most important

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.530
oh man so what's going on dude how's it

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.959
going I got out of LA cuz I was like you

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.359
know I came out to the desert I rented a

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.400
spot for you know like four days five

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.190
days cuz I'm like the type of dude it

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.690
gets whipped out of his car and beaten

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.700
and no one cares you know no one on

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.430
either side cares but you see me getting

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.489
my head kick in and both sides like yeah

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.479
that makes sense

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.930
you know like yeah I got that yeah I

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.849
would I would just get out of Dodge and

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:25.720

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.200
started GoFundMe and nobody paid their

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.160
like out whatever yeah yeah that makes

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.880
sense

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.120
like do people think like the government

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.500
gets overthrown and then there's just a

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.900
fat lesbian with green hair who's the

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.120
president what yes

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.400
well the communist revolution is

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.440
definitely gonna be like very peaceful

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.170
and there's gonna be no like you know

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.240
the meets justify the ends when it comes

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.970
to executing uh you know hundreds of

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:21.570
thousands of people it'd be good but you

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.700
you have a higher profile so they're

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.490
gonna find you easier but then after six

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.210
months don't find me they're gonna see

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.580
uh they're gonna see my retweets if my

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.870
timelines just you the file seems is

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.160
going to be a bunch of like creative

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.750
writing majors killing their parents

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.220
that's the end of right there's going to

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.510
kill their parents and move into their

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:56.640
house the moral imperative for burning

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.280

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.700
moral imperative Faludi it's like I mean

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.890
you want to see some of these people get

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.470
a brick in a hat yeah yeah and it's it's

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.240

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.970
laugh to thinking about real communist

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.950

that lady that was like open the [ __ ]

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.139
economy her just holding her stuff the

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:09.729
Baskin Robbins was open she had ice

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:18.479
cream in her hand you see white kids

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.610

yeah yeah of course yeah I don't really

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.419
blame the 15/16 or black kids for

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:34.509
grabbing sneakers because it's even I

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:36.849

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:38.590
figuring out a way to stop it polite I

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.650
kind of get that a little bit more so

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.539
than like a rich white person or a

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:45.909
middle-class white person pretending to

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:50.680
be like a black person yeah yeah but

like how did they what kind of

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.449
pre-emptive measures could they have

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:57.279
taken for like which stores the board up

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:01.090

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.880
many people that got up like it's

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.400
finally here like they were preparing on

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.010

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.730
grab a bat

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.120
although 10,000 hours of frog memes it's

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.930
all paid off

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.800
we did it we triggered them enough yeah

00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:03.320
a little more relaxed now people like

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.860
we've looted enough yeah I think so I

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.620
think they've had their fill yeah

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.860
lockers are empty they've wrote up they

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.820
wrote in the articles like you

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.380
specifically what stores got hit and I

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.720
was like that reporter that got hit with

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.250
a bottle and then the camera zooms is

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.310
what if the government gives reparations

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.490
but takes like takes off the cost of all

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.450
the looted sneakers and some dude was

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.640
like we want 14 trillion dollars a head

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.610
was like what 14 trillion reparations I

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.290
think the government's be like all right

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.270
you know minus the cost of all the

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.610
sneakers our property damage yeah you

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.430
get enough $1,500 it's like when you get

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.839
off of a cruise and you see your real

00:12:50.839 --> 00:13:00.170
bill and you're like what the [ __ ] yes

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.990
it's all gay what do you think what the

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.210
AutoZone cop who was like oh they say he

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.740
was a cop the guy who was smashing glass

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.510
and it's just a dude in full you can't

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.589
see him at all he's an wonderfull

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:11.300
motorcycle helmet they're like spread

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.339
the word this is a cop we know it for

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:15.410
sure it's just a dude it's smashed but

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.930
he does smash the AutoZone glass

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.089
like hey man here copy does do copies

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:20.589
like get the [ __ ] out here he turns like

00:13:20.589 --> 00:13:24.850
his whole body's in one direction you

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:29.050
look like cops yeah I don't I don't I

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.240
would be truly surprised if the cops

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.209
were inciting the road like I was I was

00:13:34.209 --> 00:13:35.649
a little confused when I saw those like

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:37.660
brick videos you know I like just

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.640
pallets of bricks and then somebody I'd

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.709
you know hate to give BuzzFeed credit

00:13:41.709 --> 00:13:43.209
but a guy from BuzzFeed wrote an article

00:13:43.209 --> 00:13:45.100
that debunked every single one of those

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.709
brick videos and it was like alright

00:13:47.709 --> 00:13:50.080
maybe maybe they're not maybe the cops

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.700
aren't in on it I don't know

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.839
they can't lose black dudes to

00:13:52.839 --> 00:13:54.100
conspiracy theories is that's that's

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.660
like that's propping up the Trump

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.220
campaign so it's like they in black you

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.450
love conspiracy theories they're

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.660
probably trying to like no no you look

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:06.700
back inside the FBI does get involved

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.200
right did you infiltrate those black

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.020
yeah so like so I guess I guess I get

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.390
the instinct of being like hey this

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.130
could be [ __ ] something where they're

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.630
like you know if you have a peaceful

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.420
protest a great way to get people to not

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.580
give a [ __ ] about it or to turn on it is

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.380
you just send a few people in man a

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.640
[ __ ] catch the pop you know yeah I

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.140
agreed I mean obviously that's true like

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.910
yeah the FBI and definitely all that is

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.050
definitely true but I don't think

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.240
they're sending down like one local PD

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.770
guy right now sending this they that's

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.450
because even the cops know that those

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:51.089
guys are absolutely inadequate you know

00:14:51.089 --> 00:14:53.709
see much like square bodied men rushing

00:14:53.709 --> 00:14:55.060
the Home Depot and you're like hold on a

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.310
second this is a [ __ ] this is the PD

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:13.360
yeah you see some cell phone clips

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.529
that's what they need to be looking for

00:15:14.529 --> 00:15:22.450
like a dick OtterBox they say OtterBox

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.250
they should do the analytics between

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.140
dudes who have OtterBox holsters and

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.750
Trump votes that's gotta be his damn it

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.610
like

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.350
under percent because they're afraid

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.060
you're like I'm gonna protect my phone

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:40.450
my family maybe OtterBox should start

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.860
like putting out ads to protect the

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:48.120
white race your cell phone yeah yeah

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.160
yeah man I think we're like I think it's

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.079
possible we've just become so

00:15:53.079 --> 00:15:55.060
propagandize from multiple sources if I

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.740
mean it's very possible you would have

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.450
Russian Chinese agents who are

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.220
operatives in America who are like oh

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.170
you're there right now go Stoke that up

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.670
so we could have Pete we could have like

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.230
any funny this is all this like a dude

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.180
from Guam like Guam was like yeah let's

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.399
go [ __ ] up America or like I don't think

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:11.170
anyone knows at all what's going on I

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.000
think they just the media sees it what

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.470
are we gonna spend perfect boom in it

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:19.180
you know yeah that's Twitter it's all

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.160

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.810
said less you know the last episode we

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.579
did it's like these are Twitter videos

00:16:24.579 --> 00:16:27.370

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.800
accounts and they're all like almost all

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.149
of them were at both sides of doing it

00:16:31.149 --> 00:16:33.070
almost always debunk like I watched one

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.870
earlier that was like this black dude

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.089

00:16:37.089 --> 00:16:38.470
holding it up by like its back

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.300

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.089
a live interview she was just a reporter

00:16:43.089 --> 00:16:44.470

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:39.129
drunken tragedy that's the stage of the

00:18:39.129 --> 00:18:41.200
country we're at we're like it's it

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.019
ain't gonna get much better you know

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:47.589
yeah I don't see how ya know it's like

00:18:47.589 --> 00:18:49.419
I'm usually pretty optimistic but I'm

00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:50.739
like looking at it in the state of

00:18:50.739 --> 00:18:52.690
things in terms of like again people

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.129
have in their own little little media

00:18:54.129 --> 00:18:55.960
diet that's like me I'm right tell me

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.489
I'm it's a little hamster dot you're

00:18:57.489 --> 00:18:58.869
like hitting a little colic I'm right

00:18:58.869 --> 00:19:00.700
I'm right and they're all doing it yeah

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.169
I really don't think it is until people

00:19:02.169 --> 00:19:05.109
just completely can be like yeah I'm not

00:19:05.109 --> 00:19:06.729
watching the news I'm just you know just

00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:07.389
gonna do my thing

00:19:07.389 --> 00:19:09.070
watch firsthand footage dude Sydney was

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.749
talking about he would sit there and

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:12.039
watch the news and then watch the

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:13.659
periscope footage of where the news was

00:19:13.659 --> 00:19:15.399
yeah I got all those people mostly

00:19:15.399 --> 00:19:17.080
mostly peaceful protests and he'd be

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.269
watching on periscope people beating the

00:19:19.269 --> 00:19:20.649
[ __ ] out of people all kinds of crazy

00:19:20.649 --> 00:19:22.690
[ __ ] it's just kind of like yeah it's

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.009
like what they do it's like what they do

00:19:24.009 --> 00:19:26.109
during like a flood with the news

00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:27.999
newscasters in a boat and then a guy

00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:38.739
just walks by and ankle-deep water there

00:19:38.739 --> 00:19:40.539
is clearly the objective reality but no

00:19:40.539 --> 00:19:42.460
one has any interest in it and if you

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.129
bring it up you're like if you bring out

00:19:45.129 --> 00:19:48.039
any fact or reason people like yelled

00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:51.099
the [ __ ] is wrong so everybody I think

00:19:51.099 --> 00:19:53.830
it's this weird period like between like

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.229
technology totally taking over and like

00:19:56.229 --> 00:19:57.639
it's partially

00:19:57.639 --> 00:19:59.349
because right now this is all being

00:19:59.349 --> 00:20:01.869
driven by Twitter you know and all these

00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:03.429
things I said flaming ice making is

00:20:03.429 --> 00:20:05.739
crazy but I think it may be twenty years

00:20:05.739 --> 00:20:08.589
or whatever we are phones and then we're

00:20:08.589 --> 00:20:10.359
just able to regulate ourselves much

00:20:10.359 --> 00:20:12.609
easier but like this weird in between

00:20:12.609 --> 00:20:14.289
where and now is kind of like [ __ ] us

00:20:14.289 --> 00:20:17.109
up yeah because we start blocking people

00:20:17.109 --> 00:20:19.769
in real life is like okay

00:20:19.769 --> 00:20:23.409
two weeks ago I am now asking him to put

00:20:23.409 --> 00:20:28.119
a chip in us yeah Gates was right dude

00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:32.139
yeah yeah seriously yeah I mean that's

00:20:32.139 --> 00:20:33.039
the other thing too you don't hear about

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:35.739
Cove it at all it's done it's over

00:20:35.739 --> 00:20:38.469
well yeah cuz if if you bring up if if

00:20:38.469 --> 00:20:40.239
the new the news is afraid if they bring

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.429
up kovin they're gonna get called racist

00:20:42.429 --> 00:20:45.039
that's right that's you know that's

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:48.849
worth more to them than the lives that

00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:50.289
they kept claiming we're about to be

00:20:50.289 --> 00:20:52.299
lost I'm willing to risk not being

00:20:52.299 --> 00:20:54.249
called racist for a hundred thousand

00:20:54.249 --> 00:20:56.829
ants and paps that's what I don't quote

00:20:56.829 --> 00:20:59.079
I just finally if Cuomo came out was

00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:00.969
like he said something about it

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:02.320
I just saw the headline didn't read it

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.729
but apparently he addressed the link

00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:06.999
between protesters and code vision is

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:10.570
like almost ending in the Mafia with the

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.690
protesters he's sending in the mob good

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:18.369
for social distancing yeah man all we

00:21:18.369 --> 00:21:20.109
can do is just get in shape and get hot

00:21:20.109 --> 00:21:22.509
dude oh that's why that's exactly what

00:21:22.509 --> 00:21:24.690
the podcast is about now yeah man yeah

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.009
I'm at the point right now where I've

00:21:27.009 --> 00:21:28.450
been definitely packing on a ton of

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.009
weight I was I was up on my roof deck

00:21:30.009 --> 00:21:31.359
today and I was like I'm either gonna

00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:33.129
like really ratchet down the diet or

00:21:33.129 --> 00:21:35.139
just get a hot tub and it's like become

00:21:35.139 --> 00:21:37.570
just a just try to like catch it just so

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.070
if people see me I'm in a hot tub is

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.389
like up to here in warm water the

00:21:40.389 --> 00:21:42.070
problem when you're when you're when you

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:47.829
cross the line of fat you just start

00:21:47.829 --> 00:21:49.929
accepting yourself at worse and worse

00:21:49.929 --> 00:21:52.809
versions and then you start to

00:21:52.809 --> 00:21:54.700
appreciate things about yourself then

00:21:54.700 --> 00:22:01.299
like now I get up you just you literally

00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:02.889
start saying something like I still have

00:22:02.889 --> 00:22:06.579
a towel you start measuring yourself

00:22:06.579 --> 00:22:08.310
against people that again

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.419
[Laughter]

00:22:10.419 --> 00:22:12.429
literally do I let me sort of faced with

00:22:12.429 --> 00:22:14.169
pages of people that are dead and I go

00:22:14.169 --> 00:22:18.009

00:23:44.109 --> 00:23:47.909
life he thought it was a wily coyote

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:55.779
he bought ACME dynamite in blue yeah

00:23:55.779 --> 00:23:57.369
they suddenly they came to the scene

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:59.679
they just saw him just like all black is

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:01.840
like yeah they saw his outline against

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:11.320
the wall is the sheet of the bank's

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.379
power you know yeah especially like

00:24:14.379 --> 00:24:16.419
weird weird like deck I blew himself up

00:24:16.419 --> 00:24:18.220
for like what five grand

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.919
it's right ATMs carry like thirty three

00:24:20.919 --> 00:24:21.340
grand

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.300

regret sure should I come yeah I think

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.470
anybody getting the ATM's is is not

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.590
doing it to make a point I think there

yes that's why now you'd be surprised

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.040
really have use real money of them have

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:46.430
like four tens in their cocaine addict

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.320
once I stopped doing cocaine I've never

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:54.200
been to another idea yeah well there was

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.120

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:59.800
sleep his dreams I've never I also never

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.360
thought about Phil's my dad's dreams

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.740
he's probably dreams like a dog or he's

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:10.000
just in bed like put his feet he's just

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.380
he's like some teenager pulling off his

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:17.680
white New Balances pulled down his long

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.750
tube socks like socks leave me alone

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:21.550
I wonder if cops have that dream where

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:22.900
like you can't part like they can't

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.950
choke a black dude yeah they just can't

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:39.910
strangle yeah so I've been arguing with

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.940
him and uh yeah last night I get out on

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.210
Twitter a little which kinda I got it's

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.690
an issue right now I can't it wasn't the

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:50.620
worst thing in the world

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.780
it's felt it felt corny anytime I post

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.340
something you know I get crushed by the

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.220
left whichever way the tweet leans I get

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.400
me hurted so this one was I I don't

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.720
wanna throw Phil under the bus but it

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.100
was on Fox News and they were talking

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.860
about how I think the stat was like 9 on

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.350
a non 9 unarmed black people had been

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.030
killed or something like that and 19

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.980
unarmed white people had been killed as

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.260
if that was gonna if that was like an

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.300
argument to be like you don't hear us

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.800
bitching it it's like well that doesn't

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.250
undermine the protest it's like argument

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.720
campy hey we're [ __ ] killing everybody

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:35.770
it's not about rest we did it got called

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.210
gay by a bunch of dudes and I was like

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:40.540
[ __ ] the people that were liking it and

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:55.660
retweeting it I see my retweets inside

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.090
Candice Owens retweet something and then

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.920
the next person you retweet something is

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.990
a violet communist and then the next

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:05.520
time you know we're all over the map so

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.410
that's what we should do we should be

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.290
doing that cuz it's fun

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:13.510

it's just it's going into a vortex of

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.350
like political spazzing where people are

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.130

00:32:11.559 --> 00:32:13.720
night and it's just a video of Takashi

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.730

like talking [ __ ] in the streets this is

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.110
my block [ __ ] it was funny to

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.880
imagine Trump walking out just like it's

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.080
what the [ __ ] I thought he just

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.030
tear-gassed everyone out of the way so

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:33.160
we get a hold of you just go you look

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.549
who are these people with any hope let

00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:38.830
me let me let me meet them you know like

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.230
it's like two weeks ago plus he was like

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:44.200
you're fat and she's an old bird I'm

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.510
like man this is just

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.030
I won't ask what the [ __ ] was she going

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.100
forward with the Bible like I normally I

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.960
can understand their tactics and like

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.330
how corny it is but I was she trying to

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.160
be like I'm a Christian too is that what

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.620
that was yeah this is a woman who the

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.630
second night of lockdown during the

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:02.260
pandemic

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.450
she gave people a tour of her freezer

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:12.100
before but I was like this is really in

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.730
bad taste

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.590
but you know what now that's kind of

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.270
[ __ ] up she's like we don't know which

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:25.020
one we're gonna eat today Amana I would

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.140
die without chocolate yeah real [ __ ]

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.450
Nancy Antoinette you know yeah real

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:47.040
[ __ ] stupid there yeah oh yeah man I

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.130
don't again I think I'm optimistic and I

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:52.110
think it'll be eventually will mean it

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.510
gets harder and harder but I think it's

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.280
getting so ridiculous that people are

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.470
gonna just like it with the current

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.820
presidential race it's like you know

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.590
we're under an existential threat with

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:03.210
Trump that's that's the narrative like

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.770
Trump is like bringing us to the brink

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.710
of destruction and the DNC is like you

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.300
know the think tank that is behind the

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.000
DNC remove is like go Joe Biden and it's

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.150
like yeah that's that's our response if

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.770
this job is so important that it could

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.860
lead us to the brink of like destruction

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.210
where does this guy fit in who has like

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.160
multiple weird sex charges things

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.590
stuttering can't go on Charlamagne

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:26.790
without saying something every date

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:28.560
without putting his foot on his mouth

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.420
it's like yeah how is that a real job if

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.070
that's the guy who are like we got them

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.960
it's like I just think more people gonna

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.580
be I gotta stop stupid well the

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.990
Democrats I don't know how to win like

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:38.970
Logan Paul said something very like you

00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:40.440
know whatever progressive the other day

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.690
right he's like hey black lives matter

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.460
and you gotta be like you know

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.530
anti-racist it's not enough to just be

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.420
not raised or whatever save me like a

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:51.090
nice thing and now like it was everyone

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.270
like this right and now today they're

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:57.240
like hey [ __ ] you what have you got and

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.910
it's like oh it's never enough like

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:02.790
it'll never be enough it's a religion

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:04.740
and it'll net you'll never be able to be

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.410
pure enough to [ __ ] be an ally so

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:10.470
it's like I think they want to lose like

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.620
like subconsciously they don't want to

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.960
win they like you think they like me in

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.190
subs yeah they like it stops they like

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.110
they love it what it's like to just get

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.550
smacked around a little bit maybe a

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.780
little belt around the neck

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.930
yeah I mean it's very uh yeah actually

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.100
makes a lot of sense it kind of [ __ ] up

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.359
if your whole identity is build around

00:35:32.359 --> 00:35:33.920
being a victim then like once you win

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.140
the White House it's like what are you

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:41.960
gonna do yeah it's kind of sucks being a

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.670
power what do you think just gonna do

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:57.200
once he's done rallies are keeping him

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:01.580
alive oh they have a trump rally uh

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.940
right by my house June or July 11th

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.240
pretty sick yes so whatever he does it

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.859
needs to have rallies it needs to be

00:36:09.859 --> 00:36:12.050
involved what if they could once you I

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.609
we won't make it to the point where once

00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:15.470
you die the AI gets good enough where

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:18.020
they can just have like a you body can

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.520
exist just somehow artificially

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.660
maintained where you're just a walking

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.460
West world but you just continue about

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.380
whatever your agenda was because I think

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.250
that's a magic scientist you that to

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.340
like we want to pioneer a new technology

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.170
that allows Trump to be the president

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:38.270
for the end goal time like Elon Musk is

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.640
like if you thought this launch is

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.830
impressive you got to get a load of the

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:50.450
new body shoe just like he's talking to

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:51.710
wrong and he's like was just gonna

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.720
upload Trump's consciousness to a

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.119
mainframe give him a body and he's going

00:36:56.119 --> 00:37:03.320
to be our leader so far yeah I think

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.780
he's I don't know do some people are

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.340
thinking this is gonna help Trump get

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:12.200
reelected uh I don't know probably will

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.750
dude it depends like you just create a

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.560
binary between like law and order and

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.060
chaos right and that's what you don't

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.190
want to do because if you do that the

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.890
people that say hey I own a car I rent

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:30.020
an apartment or own a house I have a

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.359
business I work at a business and I have

00:37:32.359 --> 00:37:35.960
kids and I like I want cops to be you

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.720
know held accountable but I also do

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.599
still 100

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:42.989
this is a protest without any objectives

00:37:42.989 --> 00:37:45.420
without any specific demands

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.660
that's descending into chaos looting and

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.029
criminality and then the media is going

00:37:51.029 --> 00:37:53.160
out and telling you it's not happening

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.140
they're the ones they're going out there

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.839
going yeah this is our peaceful protest

00:37:57.839 --> 00:38:01.410
and we see with our eyes so again it

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:04.200
pits Trump against media Trump wins and

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.529
it pitch chaos against order orders

00:38:07.529 --> 00:38:11.579
gonna win it just always does yeah yeah

00:38:11.579 --> 00:38:13.019
I agree I think I think with the way

00:38:13.019 --> 00:38:14.759
they're gonna have to try to spin it is

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:17.130
to be like the chaos is here because of

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.279
Trump right the only that's there gonna

00:38:20.279 --> 00:38:23.359
be it is it is that the Democrats could

00:38:23.359 --> 00:38:25.829
that might be the only demand it's like

00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:28.529
well the demand is we need to vote more

00:38:28.529 --> 00:38:30.930
Democrats into office which seems to be

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.390
what they're doing yeah anyway I think

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.519
this is this was funny I didn't see what

00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:37.319
happened I know AOC said she was gonna

00:38:37.319 --> 00:38:39.599
go down to save the people on the bridge

00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:41.940
last night did a OCA did anybody know if

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:46.920
she if you want to go fight the cops you

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.779
fight the cops you can't be on the

00:38:48.779 --> 00:38:55.769
bridge it's like pick a lane you know

00:38:55.769 --> 00:38:59.910
fighting are you [ __ ] like are you

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:01.559
[ __ ] gonna overthrow the government

00:39:01.559 --> 00:39:02.969
are you not

00:39:02.969 --> 00:39:23.579
yeah you can't call time out I genuinely

00:39:23.579 --> 00:39:25.950
have been laughing thinking about every

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:28.019
communist revolution being that just

00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:29.700
Lenin on a bridge like surrounded by

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:40.109
cops be like stop hitting us or just

00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:43.349
push me yeah this movement needs a

00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:45.210
Stalin like you don't have a Stalin you

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:49.739
need a flying Oh true it's like this

00:39:49.739 --> 00:39:52.980
movement you need a [ __ ] boss

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.349
yeah no that's true it's also the Trump

00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:57.599
I think so don't win again - because the

00:39:57.599 --> 00:39:58.980
thing that I've been I don't I haven't

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.570
seen a lot of stuff on social media but

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:01.829
the message I've been getting is that

00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:04.230
like black people hate antiphon now and

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.300
antifouling I was linked to the left so

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.740
it's like I don't think they're gonna go

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:08.790
vote for Trump but they're just gonna

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:10.260
make man [ __ ] that [ __ ] Biden in my

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.540
poems that [ __ ] they're like man I think

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.640
black people rightly are skeptical of

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.550
the idea that voting like like either

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.530
one of these parties or either one of

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:21.750
these candidates is truly gonna make a

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:24.359
big difference I think if you lose a

00:40:24.359 --> 00:40:26.040
killer Mike he's really smart

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.530
easy talks he's very smart and he talked

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:29.880
about local [ __ ]

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.099
it's got to be local you got a vote out

00:40:32.099 --> 00:40:35.640
like corrupt prosecutors DA's and all

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.910
that [ __ ] the president it's like you

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.130
know what are we doing like it's really

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.200
not affecting you as much as like a

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.859
governor a congressman or even like it's

00:40:46.859 --> 00:40:48.630
a very local level a judge

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.670
yeah judge it's just throwing people in

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.400
jail get rid of the [ __ ] judge yeah I

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.750
was reading about it with the DA's last

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:56.280
night how that was a I mean it was a

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.109
George sorro's article I'm not gonna lie

00:40:58.109 --> 00:41:00.119
but they're talking about how they were

00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:01.440
saying he's going in and like well

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.550
everyone's worried about the president

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.630
what you're saying you just go and just

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:05.310
get a bunch of DA's elected it's cheaper

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.170
to do it's easy to do and that has more

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:08.849
of a direct impact on everybody

00:41:08.849 --> 00:41:11.040
so that's pretty no I thought about that

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.339
yeah I think that's probably better

00:41:13.339 --> 00:41:16.050
signal I think Instagram is the best in

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:17.849
terms of what you can do like Instagram

00:41:17.849 --> 00:41:19.319
yeah but then stacking it would be to

00:41:19.319 --> 00:41:22.260
vote out to DA's yeah for sure

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.740
yeah I love all comedians we've all

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.510
carpet bagged our way into politics or

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:34.050
political commentators now honestly we

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:37.859
have literally no choice mmm sure I'd

00:41:37.859 --> 00:41:40.440
love to be talking about come and you

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.060
know farts right now

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:46.650
I know but [ __ ] this is get back did

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:48.300
you see the guy in the process that

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.190
started screaming like he's he's

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:52.710
speaking and then everyone's cloudy and

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:54.839
then he starts saying the n-word yes

00:41:54.839 --> 00:41:55.700
Billy

00:41:55.700 --> 00:42:01.950
what a [ __ ] wildly literally he ends

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:03.540
that he's giving a speech and people are

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.310
like oh hell yeah cuz it's like you know

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:05.660
you look

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.910
just an old old Philly guy and he stays

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:09.349
screaming and then finally he's like we

00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:12.640
are all n words

00:42:17.299 --> 00:42:21.940
I got I get where you going for bud but

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:28.970
see I guess we read the room that was

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.009
his moment he was like finally I can say

00:42:31.009 --> 00:42:33.589
I thought he must adrenaline just a

00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:35.000
hundred percent and then he was just

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.920
like it's I'm throwing it out dude here

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.900
it is I've been waiting to use it

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.089
everyone smiling at me and clapping yeah

00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:48.440
yeah n-word before his time he is that

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.609
was a solution he's like if I just say

00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:52.750
the n-word it'll bring us all together

00:42:55.029 --> 00:42:59.900
civilizations coming on done yeah yeah

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.819
man it just sucks the reason for it is

00:43:01.819 --> 00:43:03.440
it's not like if we were like getting

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.390
like directly like you know yanked out

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:06.650
of our houses and all this [ __ ] it's

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.960
just people are watching the news and

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.059
being like what and then they go out

00:43:11.059 --> 00:43:13.549

aren't like it's amazing it's almost

00:43:22.339 --> 00:43:24.079
always contradicting like statistical

statistical thing because it's like if

you look at the thing from the left

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:45.800

people on a honor timeline you go deep

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.020
in a thread a few comments she's like

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:08.640

[Laughter]

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.609
chose you Donald Trump for this moment

00:46:15.609 --> 00:46:17.839
why do you think that issue does ask

00:46:17.839 --> 00:46:22.190
Jesus Christ Elliot I've been trying to

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:25.520
dig up the my brother-in-law back when

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.980
black lives matter just started he made

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:31.620
a meme he's an Arab

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.390
arab christian he's from Egypt he's like

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.730
a Coptic Christian and he's he loves

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:38.130
Jesus he's got a Jesus tattoo he's got a

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:46.110
cross tattoo but he he's not he's got

America but he wrote when black lives

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:56.880
matter popped off he thought he was

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.460
making like kind of a nice meme and it

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.350
was just like a cartoon of Jesus being

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:04.050
crucified it said all lives matter it

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:07.950
