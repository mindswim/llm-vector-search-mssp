glorified right that's true yeah I mean

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.940

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.040
hundred people so she's a different

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.780
League of like

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.040
perfect for it and uh Jake Matera does a

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.780

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.420

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.780
like you know what it is have you ever

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.099

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.480
before it's pretty common Southern Fair

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.700
okay I know I've heard of it before but

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.519
it how'd she taste I saw you're not much

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.040
into trying new foods right exactly I'm

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.140
already like a picky eater yeah I didn't

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.900
want to do it but what's what's part of

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.120
your diet regimen like what's what's in

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.060
your like a lot of McDonald's if I'm

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.860
passing a McDonald's it's really it's

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.640
gonna be seven bucks easy

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.780
there's like toll booths for you you're

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.299

ah man I just spent seven dollars

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.099
they should do an easy pass you just go

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.239
in they just like kind of look at you

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.239
and like hey give them this 10 miles an

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.319
hour

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.500
so you're hitting fast foods not often

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.140
only if I'm only if I'm driving past one

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.540
every time I see you yeah so every time

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.099
I see this [ __ ] he's got a bag

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.260

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.939
I've been going to his place so there's

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.400
some cold fry somewhere in your car at

trash is out as soon as I'm done damn

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.459
those African gentlemen are probably

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.400
munching when they detail

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.200

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.360
[ __ ] coins and yeah a hundred and

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.640
Fries that's like an American Blood

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.820
Diamond

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.699
fresh off like a 3200 kilometer walk

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.380
from like Sudan to Kenya and they hit

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.000
your car and they're just like oh [ __ ]

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.040

cheeseburgers Aging for years dude my uh

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.400
Spud found I think the top of a biscuit

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.960
somehow from like a McDonald's sandwich

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.240
yeah it just sat there for maybe months

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.880
ate it he munched I believe he munched I

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.620
don't want to lie on his name but I

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.720
believe he just to prove a point I think

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.060
he munched I believe it put butter on it

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.919
or anything microwave it nah I think he

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.020
was just mad dogging again I know he

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.400
found this whether or not he munched it

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.720
could be a pro it could be this dark

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.000
chocolate course in through my veins I

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.620

I would they my brother you gotta know I

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.600

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.740

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.800
three days for being good yes exactly

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.539

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.199
McDonald's breakfast I will become a

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.220
[ __ ] astronaut because I haven't

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.580

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.199
pissed I have the last time I went to

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.940
the doctor is when I tried to tell her I

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.100

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.419
and she was like no you don't get out of

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.280
here she's like shutting the door on me

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.539
as I'm like is it the shoes I'm wearing

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.940

you you had it though yeah

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.960

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.699

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.960
sometimes your foot really swells up

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.699
your big toe mine never really got

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.800
swollen but like the pain was a 10

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.600

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.479
yeah yeah I've been I've been I've been

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.120
waiting for it to hit me

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.000
your shoe off and you had to describe

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.759
them as dogs barking

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.979

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.759
years of 30 years of nuggets and beers

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.199

foot attack dude

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.060

I eat like fish and chips one night for

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.060
dinner it's just like the next day yeah

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.819
God damn so it's a life it's terminal

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:55.440
yeah and that's why my doctor didn't

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.940
want to get me on pills she was like

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.340
just [ __ ] try to change your diet

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:03.300
so I probably have a lot more [ __ ] wrong

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.460
with me really I'm just not willing why

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.099

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:11.340
you want to diagnosis yeah you don't

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.319
want to you don't want to have gout oh

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:15.780

yeah but forever and it's on your health

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.139
insurance and all that [ __ ] I don't

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:21.479
think that would you don't think so in

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:24.800
our digital age of information

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.099
scrub this is this live no but we will

00:08:29.099 --> 00:08:30.360

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.940
can you smash that computer please we'll

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.200
keep it from matter of journalistic

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.219
Integrity

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:37.080
um no I'll be fine you'll get a life

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.880
insurance policy it'll be like 50 bucks

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.320
more a month and I'll give you probably

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.419
like way less if you die

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.300
so that's fine are you happy

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.500

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.200

pills I don't you got to take them

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.700
forever true so you can reverse it my

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.180
dad reversed type 2 diabetes

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.740
he just he was eating like a maniac does

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.140
the news know about it

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.000
your talk I I read you loud and clear

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.560
you're talking about how the vaccine's

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.920
[ __ ]

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:14.040
was like dude those guys in Australia

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.360
are kicking the [ __ ] out of those cops

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.019
and I love it

00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:21.060
what were you saying them diabetes is is

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.560
like you don't get rid of it I thought

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.380
type two you can you have type 2

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.660
diabetes and then not have it it's like

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.700
eight so you technically still have AIDS

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.220
but you're like counts and all the labs

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.380
come up like as if it you don't have it

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.360
yeah and you can have whatever you want

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.560
to eat essentially as long as you don't

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.360
overdo it no you'll get right back to

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.100
that's how you keep it at Bay by not

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.820
eating you know like a glutton yeah type

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.740
2 diabetes is like a marriage like

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.300
you'll probably have it for years but

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.540
you can kill it yeah yeah

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.060
right you can get rid of it it's creeped

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.220
back up on him he got same thing you

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.779
guys have the same exact thinking he was

00:09:57.779 --> 00:09:59.100
like my numbers are low so now I can

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.899

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:03.560
just like yeah bro Here Comes his

triglycerides at one point were like I

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.100
think like quadruple what they were

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.000
supposed to be

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.740

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.920
means there are dinosaurs dude damn you

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.140
have that many dinosaurs yeah it wasn't

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.000
looking good dude he was he was every

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.959
day hitting like four like a length four

00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:23.339
soft pretzels again here we go like a

00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:25.140
rack of soft pretzels dung them in the

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.300
car and like every other day rip a

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.680
milkshake on the way home and then eat

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.700
dinner

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.260
that was like and it's and that was like

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.120
Cheesesteak for lunch 60 ounces of

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.920
coffee that day oh my God imagine if the

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.180
same Africans that cleaned his car

cleaned your dad's car

00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:40.980
oh milkshakes oh dude that'd be good

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.440
just like a calcified like a fossilized

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.300
Shake pretzels don't seem like they

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.279
would pretzels will give you diabetes

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.160
that's why you have gout yes

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.660

to Smart on you after you picked out

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.260
this thing's smart after you

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.120
unscrupulously picked out only the last

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.160
time your foot hurt last summer I had it

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.079
bad really oh dude yeah except the

00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:09.480
beginning of quarantine we all did we

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.420
all did dude I mean not even not Lord

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.720
foreign

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.560
at home [ __ ] playing video games just

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.899
like drinking seven beers just getting

00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:24.120
hammered yeah and then it caught up to

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.040
me and I was going on like yeah I was

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.079
going like hiking the next week and I

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:31.320
was like oh no oh what terrible timing

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.320
yeah what'd you do

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.839
I kind I mean I didn't drink just camped

00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:39.180
instead like I'll just let's Camp it's

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.339
not like no we did some we did some

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:44.160
hiking did you really on the cow foot it

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.200
like it cleared up like I it's like

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.760
[ __ ] getting weed out of your system

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.079
in a week you know what I mean I was

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:50.160
just like

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.100
all right I guess I'll have healthier

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.320
food and it seems like your body really

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.600
doesn't want to gout it's screaming at

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.180
me it seems like it's very preventable

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.800
if you saw what was in the toilet every

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.779
day for me you'd go to the ER every day

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:06.380
really will you go you're loose guys

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.700
I don't even want to get into it really

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.339
loose I know a man who's only had

00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:13.620
diarrhea for like a decade buddy that

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.760
ain't that's the least of my words

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.760
really every day I'm like did I drink

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.660
blood last night

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.040
it's one way to go man you know I can

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.660
appreciate that that I think is just a

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.680
Hemi do you baby at all no no I should

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.160
get like pedicure and like true I wear

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.680
very supportive shoes now though like

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.180
when I first got it I was wearing like

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.019
uh like Clarks desert boots at work I'm

00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:42.540
just not supportive I also got them used

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.519
at a thrift store so maybe that guy they

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:46.079
sell new shoes at a thrift store true

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:47.459
they were brand new though like nothing

00:12:47.459 --> 00:12:49.079
on the bottom you know you can tell a

00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:52.380
Clark's been worn once sure yeah uh

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.820
but that dead guy probably gave me his

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.220
gout is what I'm driving right now I

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.360
would say so it probably came probably

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.920
rubbed off and got it in your shoe it's

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.000
a lot we don't know about medical

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.740
technology yeah I guess I'll have to go

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.320
back and ask about that doctor dude so

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.000
did she eat her words and say that uh

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.220
sorry to kind of turn you down

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.260
uh no I have not gone back to her

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.940
Senator five of this podcast when it's

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.980
done true email to her I think she also

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.380
went to like holistic medicine or

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.279
something

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:19.139
so she wasn't trying to give me pills

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:22.079
anyway really it was also very tough to

00:13:22.079 --> 00:13:23.639
get an Adderall prescription from her in

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:26.519

you would be make like a you'd be one of

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.860
those nurses I'd be like this guy's

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.019
Practitioners that's what my doctor was

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:54.240
a nurse practitioner she probably didn't

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.620

make a stellar nurse practitioner it's

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.800
basically a doctor thank you it's a

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.180
Doctor Who's just who doesn't get paid

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.139
as much

00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:06.899

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.180
yeah yeah I don't know anything that I'm

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.820
saying but I think you're in slightly

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.260
less debt and you're surrounded by more

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.279
babes

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:20.399

majority of them were younger than me

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:40.079

in the regular doctor's office so she

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.820
she went off the medical grid and then

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.740
bailed on that I think she just didn't

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.740

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.680

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.539
I accidentally sent one of my therapists

00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:11.419
a Facebook friend request

00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:14.579

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.199
happened to look like look on her page

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:18.240
by accident because it was like it was

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.980
like people you know yeah and I was like

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.179
uh

00:17:21.179 --> 00:17:22.980
I was like oh that's I think that's my

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.299
therapist and I clicked on it as soon as

00:17:24.299 --> 00:17:25.679
I clicked on it like my fat thumb hit

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:28.260
add friend oh so it was like something

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.880
wrong with that a pretty young lady like

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.500
getting [ __ ] friend requested by

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.360
somebody that looks like me

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.520

because you you what you didn't want her

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.620
dude that would have been totally fine

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.580
you could have went in there and be like

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.000
hey I've I've if I saw her on the street

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.059
now I would run into a truck before

00:17:51.059 --> 00:17:52.740
before she had the chance to catch eyes

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.600
with me dude I I hear you on that though

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.520
I I recently was at the playground I ran

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.919
into our old couples counselor and it

00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:00.600
was just the worst com it's the most

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.340
awkward thing because I'm like sitting

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.419
there talking to her it's like oh how's

00:18:03.419 --> 00:18:05.220
everything going and I was like

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.960
it's weird for us to be talking in

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.220
public I just wanted to like get away

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.200

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.179

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:30.660
awkward because it's like

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.340
I'm like does this person feel forced to

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.500
talk to me out in public right now yeah

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.299

open on this one like it doesn't have a

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:55.919

00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:58.559
closed yeah it's wide open yeah like

00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:00.059
just dudes waiting for me to come in and

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:01.980
order six donuts and a sandwich at 2 30

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.740
in the morning

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.059
it might have been a mirage it might

00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:08.159
have been a [ __ ] gout Mirage dude I

00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:09.480
went to the one right next to my house

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.600
last week and I like it was like also

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.159
like two in the morning and I pulled on

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:16.020
the door and they were like go to the

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.480
drive-thru and I was like [ __ ] so I went

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.400
to the drive-thru but this is another

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.679
time you're at Dunkin Donuts before I

00:23:22.679 --> 00:23:25.340
learned my lesson

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.600
and I went to the drive-through and I

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.559
was like well I can't even see the

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:30.240
[ __ ] Donuts from here so I had to go

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.820
back to the door

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.799
and then by the time I went to the door

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:37.559
there was a line of cars so I was like

00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:39.720
I'm not gonna wait in the [ __ ] line

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.820
of cars no it's not fair but yeah you

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.440
got to go you gotta go see what's good

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.260
you got to see the lineup

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.460
walked back home and got my car and then

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.600
drove through

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.760
did you leave a Yelp review

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.550
as a gouted American

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.140
[Laughter]

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.820
dude I was thinking about Yelp reviews

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.340
recently just how absolutely hilarious

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.640
there are you ever leave one no uh I

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.679
think I left you know what I'll take

00:24:04.679 --> 00:24:06.600
that back I think I left one for my

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.919
brother's shop

00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:10.799
and I think they flagged it really yeah

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:12.480
because it's kind of ridiculous yeah I

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.679
think the stuff I was writing was kind

00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:15.419
of ridiculous I tried to write jokey

00:24:15.419 --> 00:24:16.980
Alps a couple times they got flat every

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.020
single time really I don't know just

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.460
like [ __ ] I used to I used to try to

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.620
write I think I think I did this where I

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.480
wrote at least one that was an absolute

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.159
like ridiculous story and they were like

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:28.919
nah bro not buying it yeah like not this

00:24:28.919 --> 00:24:30.120
is not happening you're just practicing

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.039
your fiction writing on Yelp kinda I

00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:33.000
just thought it'd be funny to write like

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.740
just read not like damning Yelps but

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.360
just like weird yeah like so many

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.580
reasons like I don't know whether I want

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.320
to go to this place or not but I want to

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.140
know what the [ __ ] this guy's up to yeah

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.640
dude I just I don't know what I don't

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.720
have I mean this is like the worst thing

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.159
to say on a comedy podcast but like

00:24:47.159 --> 00:24:49.440

don't know what it's going to be but

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.400
it's just 45 minutes of Yelp crowd work

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.799
just non-stop dude I'm just I read them

00:25:13.799 --> 00:25:15.000
every now and again they're so [ __ ]

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.620
funny dude you're gonna freestyle Yelp

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.539
tomorrow I'm like dude I want to start

doing one where I just just start like

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.799
documenting it was very meta but I want

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.480
to like save up five Yelps and just like

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.100
break them down in depth and go into

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.320
like what happened what kind of Yelp

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.059
this is specifically

00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:32.039
sounds like a TED Talk critique Yelps I

00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:33.900
think I want to I want to get into like

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.779
like really meta Yelp thing but yeah

00:25:36.779 --> 00:25:39.659
dude it's an insane Behavior dude yeah I

00:25:39.659 --> 00:25:40.500
mean

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.779
have you guys yelled I mean it's fine if

00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:45.120
you have not only yell I I've left one

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.039
that I remember what was it what was it

00:25:47.039 --> 00:25:49.140
dude it was so [ __ ] up that I was like

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.880
I have to help this yeah yeah I went

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.860
through this Avengers Yelp I'll that's

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.140
fine when people give it like four stars

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.820
like the Ambiance was nice but not

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.500
everything I expected if you're a

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:02.220
Vengeance Yelp 100 yes please it was it

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.740
was this uh soup place in media and it

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.179
was the small little shop I was like all

00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:07.380
right this would be good I'm a big soup

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.419
guy I walk in there that's that's also

00:26:09.419 --> 00:26:11.100
an emotional letdown if someone [ __ ] up

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.740
soup it's so hard to [ __ ] up but what

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.779
this lady did was so egregious I ordered

00:26:15.779 --> 00:26:19.200
my soup she goes over she uh she Scoops

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.760
them out puts it in a cup which wasn't

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.980
for me and then she puts the spoon back

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.340
in she takes the bite what puts the

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.380
spoon back in again what and then Ladle

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.600
some more out so she bit like a piece

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.159
like a chunk of chicken or something in

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:34.820
front of everybody

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.039
I was like uh can you cancel my soup and

00:26:38.039 --> 00:26:39.539
the cashier was like why I was like

00:26:39.539 --> 00:26:41.520
because she just [ __ ] ate out from

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.799
The Cauldron yeah

00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:45.260
is she a witch

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.380
she's very witch like probably 250 of

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.440
Middle Eastern descent yeah yeah that's

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.159
yeah that's a bruja for sure

00:26:55.159 --> 00:26:57.779
so she sipped from what kind of soup was

00:26:57.779 --> 00:26:58.860
it

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.860
um was it a [ __ ] I can't be sure but I

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.360
like game based or was it broth I don't

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.740
like cream based soup it was probably

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.080
either like a chicken and rice or like a

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.220
minestrone

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.960
that's [ __ ] it was in front of

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.640
[ __ ] everybody there's probably six

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.200
people in the [ __ ] line good

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.059
eyewitnesses too yeah I was there with

00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:16.740
my boss and we both just looked at each

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.179
other as soon as it happened like you

00:27:18.179 --> 00:27:21.059
[ __ ] yeah give me my money b-i-t-c-h

00:27:21.059 --> 00:27:22.799
yeah absolutely what should I say

00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:25.799
w-i-t-c-e

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.080
so what how does she feel was she did

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.520
she give attitude or she like you got me

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.899
she got ready dude I'll never forget

00:27:33.899 --> 00:27:35.760
when I said like you just ate out of

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.210
that shoot whatever it was to it

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:44.600
[Laughter]

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.220
to be fair she could have been someone's

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.899
like like uh where was she from he said

00:27:48.899 --> 00:27:50.880
like Middle Eastern uh yeah well she was

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.620
dark skinned so I just naturally assume

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.299
everybody that has skin darker than mine

00:27:54.299 --> 00:27:56.840
is this muscle

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.580
so let's say she was you know she

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.720
probably correctly identified her

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.580
somewhere within that kind of geosphere

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.080
she could have just been like coming

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.700
from another country where she made soup

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.559
in the house dude and I get it like a

00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:09.720
little for the little [ __ ] Mohamed

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.520
and then she's with every now and again

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.840
would just as a mother of the house

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.480
would Ladle the soup I get him and I

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.919
think like that you didn't do anything

00:28:16.919 --> 00:28:19.140
wrong but she was probably like [ __ ]

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.840
[ __ ] I forgot I'm not in like a my Adobe

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.640
Matt I really think like that's what

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.799
chefs do but it's just behind the scenes

00:28:25.799 --> 00:28:28.700
yeah

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.559
she's a soup scooper

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:36.419
oh she was just hungry she's at a place

00:28:36.419 --> 00:28:37.919
where she gets free soup too so it's

00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:40.020
like she could have just gone and eaten

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:40.940
the soup

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.760
was a manager like you can you know you

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.200
think she's expecting you to come back

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.480
there and [ __ ]

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.440
I think they they just didn't know what

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.700
to do because it was just the cashier

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.059
and then this soup slurping lady

00:28:54.059 --> 00:28:55.140
when

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.960
I'm getting caught celebrity going on I

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.000
did

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.860
yeah no debate it's like she knew she

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.120
was wrong and I made her get in the

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.360
corner

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.580
dude that's so [ __ ] I think that's

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.840
the only one I've ever left though I did

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.220
leave what was the what did the review

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.779
and Compass did you say some Muslim

00:29:12.779 --> 00:29:15.020
[ __ ]

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.480
I the title was she thought 911 was bad

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.520
dude my uh my friend stayed in [ __ ] what

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.140
what the [ __ ] was this place called I

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.340
can't remember the name of it but it was

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.140
like one of those like

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.600
halfway can talk it's like a halfway

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.059
house but also you can it's like you can

00:29:36.059 --> 00:29:38.100
go there if you violate parole or you

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.240
can also kind of like serve the rest of

was saying that he was like I was asking

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.539
him and he was like yeah bro you guys

00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:05.700
got a case we had we had a legitimate

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.200
case he did it was funny I was talking

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.279
to him about that I'm like yeah I heard

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:09.360
this place it's all the Google review

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.740
said it's pretty unfair towards white

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.179
people he was like

00:31:12.179 --> 00:31:14.159
that is true this place is but he goes

00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:16.679
but you know having been in uh jail for

00:31:16.679 --> 00:31:18.539
a while and he wasn't trying to like be

00:31:18.539 --> 00:31:20.220
like any kind of brownie points I was

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.720
talking to him he was like I would say

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.919
the rest of jail is pretty unfair

00:31:22.919 --> 00:31:25.260
towards black people a whole other part

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.580
of this he's like from what I've seen

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.799
it's pretty unfair

00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:30.059
you don't have to do it for like six

00:31:30.059 --> 00:31:31.799
months too right what like a halfway

00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:34.500
house thing yeah it was for like yeah it

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.460
was for people who were like either

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.779
finishing out their sentence or if you

00:31:36.779 --> 00:31:37.980
got out and you're on parole and you

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.539
violated but it wasn't bad enough to

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:41.700
like go all the way back to like a state

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.100
or a county jail like a rehab halfway

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.059
house

00:31:45.059 --> 00:31:47.399
parts of it were there was the doc side

00:31:47.399 --> 00:31:48.779
which was like Department of Corrections

00:31:48.779 --> 00:31:50.039
and failed parole and then there was the

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:51.960
other part too if you just want DUI guys

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.399
and there's yeah and then there was the

00:31:53.399 --> 00:31:54.779
criminals yeah like yeah like there's in

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:57.000
jail for heroin and [ __ ] but yeah

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.220
what he was saying is you would pass so

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.080
if he was on the doc side Department of

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.340
Corrections then you would pass the

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.779
dudes who were just in there for like

00:32:03.779 --> 00:32:05.640
their family sent him there and the

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.899
dudes from the other side would like

00:32:06.899 --> 00:32:08.279
rough you up and try like because they

00:32:08.279 --> 00:32:09.360

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.720
because we were living with my parents

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.680
at the time because I just got out of

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.060

um

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.160
you had a Piercing Pagoda it might have

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.300
been piercing me good because it was

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.160
like it was right next to like if I

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.740
think it was between sparrows and Things

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.940
Remembered

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.420
so whatever was there that's what it was

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:53.579
so I presented to my wife with these uh

00:38:53.579 --> 00:38:56.099
earrings in my mom's kitchen and she

00:38:56.099 --> 00:38:57.900
opened the thing up and she left and

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.099
she's like I don't even have my ears

00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:00.720
pierced and I just [ __ ] lost and I

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.460
punched him

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:07.020
is your mom's fridge too and then they

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.420
gave you [ __ ] just that's a

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.740
satisfying Poncho you hear like the

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:14.599
ketchup bottles rattled popsicles

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:17.220
that's like a slot machine dude but I

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.780
got I got Vicodin for that and it was

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.099
the first time I ever had painkillers oh

00:39:20.099 --> 00:39:21.480
she never had painkillers before that I

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.940
had never had them so I got painkillers

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.500
and I wasn't drinking so I just got a

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.359
bunch of O'Douls and I sat in front of

00:39:27.359 --> 00:39:29.040
the TV and crushed Vicodin into the

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.780
Duels for like a weekend

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.820
and then um you know these are duels are

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.820
kicking it

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.440
but that I recognize is like okay these

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.339
are the painkillers are making me

00:39:38.339 --> 00:39:40.320
feeling this good and then as I ran out

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.579
I was just like all right well maybe if

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:43.980
I just take like like 15 [ __ ] Tylenol

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.960
it'll have the same effect

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.720
what to do uh

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.339
nothing I just made me want painkillers

00:39:50.339 --> 00:39:52.560
even more

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.000
yeah I think it'll fry your liver I

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.680
think they acetaminophen yeah or

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.060
whatever it's called and Tylenol like

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.579
[ __ ] it'll it will yeah a certain dose

00:39:59.579 --> 00:40:00.839
like you'll shut your liver off yeah

00:40:00.839 --> 00:40:01.859
that's the one you're not supposed to

00:40:01.859 --> 00:40:03.780
drink on yeah yeah

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:07.440
especially not some duels dude fine I'll

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.339
try Advil next time

00:40:10.339 --> 00:40:13.819
that might be the best story though

00:40:13.819 --> 00:40:17.339
I mean what a perfect reward just

00:40:17.339 --> 00:40:18.780
[ __ ] punching that and it's like yeah

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.520

yeah getting hooked up was it was it was

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.079
crazy how much they gave those things

00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:36.300
out I probably valid point earlier

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.440
before we went on Del Carlo talk about

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.000
how the medical establishment just gave

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.319
us opiates without any kind of

00:40:40.319 --> 00:40:41.460
discernment now we're supposed to trust

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.480
them again with the vaccine can you

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.420
elaborate on that

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.640
oh my God

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.920
your word is not his dude how the same

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.960
body the mirror no the same bodies who

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.760
basically sunk the global economy into

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.380
like a national meltdown through you

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.520
know looking the other way to corporate

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.619
greed led us into the sub subprime

00:40:58.619 --> 00:41:00.660
Financial mortgage crisis those same

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.859
bodies are leading us out of this one

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:02.760
you were talking about that could you

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.660
elaborate on that you're talking about

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.260
the sacklers

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.760

it's pretty far the um yeah that's yeah

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.240

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.160
know a lot of people who uh

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.420

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.400
guy hands him the magazine for it and he

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.660
just starts popping off in the wedding

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:57.119

00:42:57.119 --> 00:43:00.590
yeah oh yeah she's like Gavin Newsom

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:08.890
[Laughter]

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.520
that's dude that's insane and they were

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.240
just

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.220
no wonder [ __ ] they didn't they like

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:17.460
wait who killed uh that guy I don't want

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.440
to say Osama Bin Laden Saddam Hussein

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.359
Saddam Hussein yeah uh I think he was

00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:22.740
actually people Iraqi people yeah

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.079
obviously well he was executed he was um

00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:27.359
Jesus he was hung I think yeah yeah they

00:43:27.359 --> 00:43:29.280
hung up like a bulldozer or something I

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.839
think they [ __ ] we had a legitimate

00:43:30.839 --> 00:43:33.079
trial

00:43:33.079 --> 00:43:35.599
of Homeland

00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:37.619
Gaddafi they stuck a stick up his ass

00:43:37.619 --> 00:43:40.579
yeah that's the way to go

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:44.160
uh I think like I think partly to death

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.260
and then like beaten trampled and like

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.180
Jesus I think the clintons ran him over

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.060
too

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:54.200
yeah they hit him with gravedigger

00:43:55.390 --> 00:44:01.300
[Laughter]

00:44:03.319 --> 00:44:05.220
they are

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.319
um I went to uh what do they call that

00:44:07.319 --> 00:44:09.119
with the [ __ ] monster truck rally I went

00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:10.560
there one time and there's a truck that

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.200
like it looks like a dog and a wheel

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.000
came flying off at one at one point and

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.619
the guy said well they're gonna get that

00:44:16.619 --> 00:44:18.180
fixed real quick because you can't keep

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.960
a good dog down

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.220
I can't believe these tickets were free

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.920
I must have rushed dude it was electric

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.800
that must have destroyed you can't keep

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.400
a good dog god damn God that guy

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.960
probably demanded head when he went home

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.280
he's like no you don't understand you

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.319
have to suck my dick you should have

00:44:37.319 --> 00:44:38.819
seen me out there he waited to get home

00:44:38.819 --> 00:44:40.859
before he got head do you think yeah the

00:44:40.859 --> 00:44:42.240
other guy might just instantly be like

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.920
oh that dude was getting gobbled in the

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.680

truck rallies like I sure am there's

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.480
probably a hundred girls trying to [ __ ]

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.980
the drivers after every one of those

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.900
rallies he's probably you know what he

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.980
probably does he probably like

00:45:01.579 --> 00:45:03.780
he probably does an announcement for

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.819
like the [ __ ] that go he's like uh

00:45:05.819 --> 00:45:09.060

yeah you could be right that's uh

00:45:17.099 --> 00:45:19.140

jobs every

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.460

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.579
fair point you think when you start

00:45:32.579 --> 00:45:34.200
doing nursing competitions like you'll

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.560
find yourself

00:45:36.599 --> 00:45:41.300
like nursing crossbody [ __ ] galleries

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.880
nursing CrossFit would be sick

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.680
just hoisting bodies by yourself

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.540
just [ __ ] grabbing bags of pee and

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.640
just being like

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.920
shave balls as an operating room orderly

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.200
what and when people would what

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.819
attachment would you what was your

00:46:11.819 --> 00:46:14.060
control

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.079
sometimes if it was like a Latin guide

00:46:16.079 --> 00:46:17.660
give them a fade

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.700

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.940
did you put like a little no there was

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.440
an attachment well they would give you

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.839
like a disposable

00:46:29.839 --> 00:46:32.520
yeah well no it was like it was like

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.800
handheld so it wasn't like flow be sized

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.140
but uh break out like a sterile thing

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.060
every time like a barbecue artist I

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.280
think I remember package yeah oh really

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.560

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.300
like socially awkward and I didn't know

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.060

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.760
awkward nice day huh dude to that point

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.020
like I didn't know if I was supposed to

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.060
shave the whole pubis so I would just go

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.339
halfway then eventually like one day my

00:46:56.339 --> 00:46:58.740
boss was like

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.760
what's the penis

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.099
so you're talking about like taint balls

00:47:05.099 --> 00:47:07.319
and it just it's just yeah just the

00:47:07.319 --> 00:47:09.839
whole enchilada whoa the whole pubic

00:47:09.839 --> 00:47:11.880
Mound what did you do I would go halfway

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.099
like whatever side

00:47:14.099 --> 00:47:17.180
two-facing them

00:47:21.559 --> 00:47:25.220
look what you did to me

00:47:25.619 --> 00:47:28.079
so you saw a lot of dicks then what are

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:30.599
they doing brother what did they do how

00:47:30.599 --> 00:47:32.520
did you feel about I never like got the

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.260
opportunity to see a ton of dicks and

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.540
what did that do for your world view in

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:38.099
terms of like it was eye-opening mate

00:47:38.099 --> 00:47:41.960
it's like spending a semester abroad

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:45.920
you're a lot more tolerant

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.119
but dude the worst would be like when a

00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:49.740
[ __ ] when a monster bird would come

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:50.940
in there because you gotta like you

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.160
gotta like flick it away would you have

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.740
like a stick for an apparatus for like

what'd you do for that uh

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.640

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.940
like just nudge it to the side

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:04.260
no like when they get so they could hold

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.180
their own dick to the side but they won

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.400
you could but like most people like they

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.420
just assume that you know what you're

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.099

I didn't get to do that during my two

00:48:41.819 --> 00:48:43.319
weeks of training because it was like

00:48:43.319 --> 00:48:45.540
they want you to do training from each

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.520

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.020
first few days on second few days on

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.359

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.780
pretty pretty early on like there were

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:02.160
two operating rooms that were designated

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.980
for like hernia surgeries yeah or yeah

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.180

hernia surgeries and they're just like

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.119
uh yeah you got to give this guy a shade

00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:10.920
before he goes in there and I was like

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.780

for the next video Just For the Life

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:52.319
yeah yeah they had a channel I don't

00:57:52.319 --> 00:57:53.400
know they had to finish their final

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.720
video I don't think they released like

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:57.540
how she died though no I think the uh

00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:00.359
autopsy is today really but they did

00:58:00.359 --> 00:58:04.460
where did they find her in a Six Flags

00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:08.420
[ __ ] the bat coaster at Six Flags

00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:10.500
I don't know she was like this when I

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.359
found her it's actually not a bad move

00:58:12.359 --> 00:58:13.740
take someone up to like the Tower of

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.799
Terror

00:58:15.799 --> 00:58:18.000
did you follow the [ __ ] terror terror

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.040
she fell out of the Tower of Terror uh

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.960
seemingly eight hours after she died

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:27.380
that's crazy she was dead

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:32.339
oh so there really are ghosts in here so

00:58:32.339 --> 00:58:33.839
they found her bought they found the

00:58:33.839 --> 00:58:36.059
remains yeah and it's looking like the

00:58:36.059 --> 00:58:37.260
boyfriend might have had something to do

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:40.280
with it I mean

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:45.420
okay he came in and murder is the cause

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:46.859
of the motor is the case that they gave

00:58:46.859 --> 00:58:48.720
him

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.780
so now that guys are still pending but

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.400
they have enough to confirm that it is

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.260
her and she was murdered he gave her the

00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.780
ultimate scratch so now he's officially

00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:59.940
a suspect then oh officially because

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:01.619
they're searching for him they found the

00:59:01.619 --> 00:59:04.260
link yeah they got the link yeah so he

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:07.500
is on the lamb God damn dude what would

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.780
you do I wonder if he can negotiate too

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.880
like when he if he gets convicted like

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.740
finish his sentence in the van

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:15.359
true he's just like look it's the same

00:59:15.359 --> 00:59:16.680
size yeah I didn't want to be here in

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.380
the first place

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.000
he should be able to do a hashtag or do

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.260
you think no he'll be in jail for the

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:24.119
rest of his life if he gets caught I

00:59:24.119 --> 00:59:26.280
think he killed himself probably you

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.380
think so yeah

00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:30.599
I mean he's in the [ __ ] woods dude

00:59:30.599 --> 00:59:33.839
like with a Federal Manhunt you know

00:59:33.839 --> 00:59:36.299
yeah I don't know but I mean they lost

00:59:36.299 --> 00:59:38.460
track of him already once I know I mean

00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.740
he does have [ __ ] [ __ ] cops on his

00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.839
K on his side so maybe he could Escape

00:59:42.839 --> 00:59:44.640
for a while but like he'll get him he's

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.619
gonna swim to [ __ ] Cuba you know like

00:59:46.619 --> 00:59:47.640
true

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.380
he's got nowhere to go just an island of

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.230

like a tiff yes I heard about this after

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.680
like a couple picked him up and then he

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.599
