WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.360
all right um

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.799
so this is

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.200
a another little patreon project i'm

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.360
working on so i really am trying to

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.120
give you guys as much as possible at

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.799
least all that i can you know

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.279
but also still total the line of where

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.480
i'm not just like

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.480
literally just taking a [ __ ] and putting

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.480
it on patreon

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.480
that's just a waste of everybody's time

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.000
um but

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.840
so here was here's what happened to me

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.119
today

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.960
i i did i'm doing my little micro dose

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.920
experiment and again

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.680
i have this thing in my head right now

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.640
it really bothers me about

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.239
people judging me for doing small

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.079
amounts i don't know why that bothers me

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.960
it [ __ ] does

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.160
uh and you know it's playful ribbing i

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.719
get it

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.680
i'm not i'm not mad but what i want to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.239
express

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.840
and make sure i'm clear in expressing

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.680
this is

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.840
that because basically what i'm going

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.879
into this is a like an audio

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.559
i mean i guess it could be an audio

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.559
anxiety journal or whatever

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.720
but the point is and again this is what

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.119
the i'm trying to work on with this book

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.040
is and i might have to like you know it

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.880
might even make it even more of a niche

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.439
than i

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.040
currently have it as but the idea

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.759
is using hallucinogenic agents

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.640
to as a form of exposure therapy for

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.000
people who suffer

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.240
from chronic anxiety whether that be

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.320
generalized anxiety disorder

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.799
or you know panic disorder which is just

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.159
having panic attacks

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.159
agoraphobia all that stuff agoraphobia

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.360
everything

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.479
um so again i'm i'm talking about

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.600
very small amounts that you know the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.439
average fish head obviously can just

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:43.920
champ

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.200
and it's not a problem to them and i i

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.799
get that and again if i'm in a different

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.680
setting

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.280
you know i'm hanging out it's obviously

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.799
a party everyone's having fun not a big

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.680
deal

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.840
but i'm i tend to take these things in

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.799
the morning

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.640
uh you know go and start doing my

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.840
day-to-day tasks

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.640
tasks i can never say that word tasks

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.719
one of my day-to-day tasks

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.840
whatever um doing one of the tasks of

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.879
the day it's such a

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.239
[ __ ] up word so

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.680
it's not so much the substance is

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.200
you know [ __ ] me up it's that

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.520
the substance in a small dose is a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.920
rather reliable vehicle for me

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.440
into a state that's like a adrenalized

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.319
possibly pre-anxiety state and then the

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.920
whole idea is to get myself

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.560
there through the use of a small amount

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.160
of one of these things obviously too i'm

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.519
not trying to like wipe myself off the

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.360
[ __ ] map on a

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.440
what is it wednesday tuesday i don't

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.360
know [ __ ] maybe i should slow down i

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.640
don't know what day it is but you get

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.440
the point

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.879
that's definitely tuesday so

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.160
you know the whole thing i'm trying to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.480
communicate here is don't [ __ ] judge

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.959
don't be

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.720
you know don't be hit me with [ __ ]

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.160
evil hippie braggart rights

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.440
be like again again

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.120
i'm pretty clear i shouldn't over you

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.080
know the thing coming up that follows

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.239
this is me recording on my phone

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.879
basically how i talk myself out out of a

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.959
anxiety state and this is what i

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.319
do to myself and i'm trying to

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.599
i'm trying to put these things in

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.519
granular terms that's a word i learned

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.200
from graduate school granular means

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.640
something that can be easily find or

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.239
actually like dealt with rather than

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.120
like wild theory and extrapolation

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.640
so i'm trying to really systematize my

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.720
approach to anxiety you know it's it's

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.720
an exposure therapy it's nothing

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.519
new i'm just putting the fresh spin on

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:35.840
it

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.440
and and again it's like i'm a dude who

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.080
again

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.560
it sounds it sounds like a little bit

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.239
it's like you know i had it was like

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.080
0.1 and then like three to five

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.239
milligrams thc

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.080
but again it's like that's nothing but

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.440
you're talking to a dude who used to

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.879
only be able to run on a treadmill for a

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.080
minute before thinking he's about to

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.200
have a heart attack and running out of

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.400
the gym so you got to meet people where

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.840
they're at you know i'm

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.360
i don't expect you guys to do it i'm

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.720
obviously a trained therapist i don't

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.599
know how to do this but

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.280
i'm just [ __ ] on but it still stands

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.799
so for your you know interests

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.080
pleasure education scorn

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.799
whatever this elicits from you you know

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.160
that's you

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.639
um but for whatever just for i guess for

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.680
you to fill up the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.959
seconds of your day that you don't know

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.360
what to do with here is about 10 minutes

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.400
of me

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.919
more or less talking myself out of a

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.759
hole and this is how i basically do it

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.919
thank you oh also uh there's like

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.840
i lost like 40 seconds i started [ __ ]

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.199
around on my phone as i was recording

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.639
this on my cell phone

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.800
so like i i talk one second and then it

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.000
jumps real quick that's because

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.759
for like 45 seconds it was nothing but a

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.040
static buzz

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.880
but you know just follow it the best you

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.560
can get what you can from it and if you

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.360
listen and say

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.040
[ __ ] this guy and everything he stands

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.800
for i [ __ ] hate his guts then you

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.160
know

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.840
that's that you know you can do that

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.120
uh it's about 10 20 a.m i've now

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.199
started to experience a significant

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.800
level of anxiety

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.600
i believe i ate it around let's see what

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.199
time i called

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.240
yeah that's where um i lost all that

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.440
footage

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.280
and you didn't miss anything i i

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.280
basically said what time i ate it at

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.639
which i think was like 8

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.080
40 in the morning i forget um

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.240
and then who knows probably went on to

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.080
describe like the synergistic effect

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.720
between

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.280
thc and psilocybin how even in small

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.840
doses

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.440
the two can kind of play off of each

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.520
other and one can heighten the other or

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.199
they can heighten each other

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.880
that is a real thing you can look into

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.160
that uh so i think i'd probably talk

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.280
about that and then

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.639
honestly i don't remember what else then

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.240
it jumps into the next point which is

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.919
whatever the [ __ ] i'm talking about

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.360
now so i'll probably have to take the

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.600
coconut oil down to like

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.759
10 i guess although these things

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.280
definitely

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.120
they do something um

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.520
yeah when the anxiety kicked on i almost

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.000
went outside i was like you know what

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.960
i'm gonna go outside and just get the

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.800
[ __ ] out of here

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.240
um i i felt like compelled

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.479
to be outside i have felt compelled to

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.720
obey whatever

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.120
whatever that voice of anxiety is that's

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.639
like we gotta get out of here

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.880
if we go outside we'll be safe if we do

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.039
this we'll be safe and it's like

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.440
no if we do that we're going to continue

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.919
down a weird path of anxiety

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.639
and just you know just run from an

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.840
imaginary predator

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.759
or we channel the hunter

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.520
you know the hero archetype and just go

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.240
let's face it right into it running

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.240
[ __ ] shield and sword just [ __ ] you

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.039
dude

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.720
there's a monster in our mess dude it's

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.720
a chimera

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.639
scaring us dude we gotta [ __ ] slash

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.319
that [ __ ] down dude this whole

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:53.840
like

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.759
you know trying to wrap ourselves in

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:57.520
blankets and all this [ __ ]

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.160
nah man there's a [ __ ] monster

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.880
somewhere

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.440
in your brain when you have anxiety you

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.880
got to figure out what the [ __ ] that

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.520
thing is and then run at it full speed

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.800
take that [ __ ] out

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.360
i almost put my shoes on i almost put my

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.599
shoes on again as much as i tell myself

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:16.240
oh it's just

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.840
this and that this these bodily

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.080
sensations are so [ __ ] real

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.960
they hit you and you're like i you know

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.800
what yeah all those other times this is

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.720
this is the real deal i know i like you

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.840
know i know i had a little bit of

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.599
anxiety

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:33.120
and i just kind of like

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.680
you know force myself to deal with it

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.440
and i guess disobey

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.680
the mandate of anxiety if that makes

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.880
sense like the

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.680
oh my god x is going to happen we better

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.400
do y

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.319
otherwise x is going to happen x and

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:47.919
then if you can just say you know what

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:48.479
no

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:51.280
x is not going to happen it's not going

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.960
to [ __ ] happen

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.840
you know it's like maybe i fight anxiety

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.240
with a little bit of [ __ ] anger dude

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.240
you know channel into the [ __ ] hero

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.680
archetype and it's like no dude

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.759
i've had enough i'm not going to be

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.599
[ __ ] you know

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:07.440
living in a bird cage my whole life

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.039
because i get a little nervous sometimes

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:10.319
and that runs away with me i'm not

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:13.840
i'm just not doing that

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.319
so you really do have to like just

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:18.240
plunge into the you know

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.840
you gotta plunge into these things full

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.560
[ __ ] speed

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:28.080
yep just like that dude i'm back on top

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.400
i'm having a good time it's just

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.479
something about my brain when you hit it

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:34.159
with the you know again this was just an

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.080
experiment of the

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.640
micro dose my microdose weed bears which

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.320
is like again like you know point

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.599
it's only point one of mushrooms man

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:43.360
which people can be like again

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.399
i could be wrong there could be like

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.600
point four in that [ __ ] thing because

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.800
it's not mixing right

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.519
my math is about point one slightly less

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:51.279
and then like three milligrams

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:53.920
of weed per bear which is just such a

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.040
small amount

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.480
but dude i'm telling you like it's not

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.040
just me this thing [ __ ] hit me

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.880
it actually i actually feel the effect

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.640
of such a small amount it's not just in

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.040
my head

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.120
ah man it's crazy i have like a super

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.640
sensitive physiology

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.720
which you know is good on some level i

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.640
guess i don't [ __ ] know

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.040
but yeah just that's that just anxiety

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.839
voice man

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:18.480
needs to be railed against cannot cannot

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.000
cannot cannot

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.320
let anxiety or just inherent negativity

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.399
you know be the pen of your life it just

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.600
cannot be

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.399
cannot be

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:34.000
you know it's almost like you get

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.720
yourself to this point to like the bug

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.640
out like oh my god

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.480

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.600
happen man i never did this before and

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.200
you get yourself that point and like

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.720
rather than being like oh [ __ ] this is a

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.920

understand that the human body is really

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:42.399
nothing but energy

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:46.240

uh neurotic rambling mess but that's the

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.600
reality

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.040
that's the reality of my situation

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.240

funky bro i'm not gonna lie that

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.200

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.200
more but even if it's not

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.920

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.360
it's a hair trigger on my anxiety dude

sets it the [ __ ] off

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:40.880

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.880
with other people no problem dude if i'm

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.399

of the mind

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.920

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.600
little mental landscape here and there

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.279
and again it's not like

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:19.519
like i i've eaten like a quarter ounce

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:21.519
of mushrooms and i i've eaten higher

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:23.120
doses

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.480
of you know [ __ ] like that and

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.800
it's the same thing you just like you're

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.560
fully tripping you bug out you stop

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.000
bugging out and you just you know

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.279
sit there and think you're going to

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:34.639
wander the earth or whatever the [ __ ]

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:36.880
you go through your stupid head

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.560
but the trick the trick for me right now

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.639
is just altering it a little bit

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:44.720
especially in your day-to-day operation

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.920
you hit yourself with a little bit of

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.920
anxiety again if you're not cool

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.279
just eat a little more until you hit

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:50.720
that you're like because if you eat a

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.399
lot it is kind of completely

00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:54.079
if you have one foot in both realms it

00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:55.600
gets it's kind of weird because like

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.079
you're

00:14:56.079 --> 00:14:57.839
operating normally you're doing your

00:14:57.839 --> 00:14:59.279
thing but you're also on another level

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:00.160
like

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.000
kind of off and again you might have

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.360
like mechanic brain where you're just

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.440
kind of like whoa things look cool

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.440
man i'm [ __ ] jealous of you i don't

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.480
know what the [ __ ] going on in my

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.920
brain when things start looking funny

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.279
it all starts to fall apart for me i'm

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:13.279
like what the [ __ ] is this why do i have

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.880
these two dogs oh my god this is my

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.079
house

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:19.360
and i want to know so

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.639
i'm just ready for just someone to be

00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:22.720
like this you can't handle it i

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.800
obviously can dude it's fine

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.399
i'm just being but i'm being honest with

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:27.920
myself in terms of like

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.320
i hit a [ __ ] speed bump and i could

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.000
have just [ __ ] left

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
this is not happening earns went about

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.680
my weird little life but instead it was

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.320
like

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.600
i basically crucified this thing dude

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.680
crucified it and uh actually i was about

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.959
to say

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:44.639
you know like destroying the cross in a

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:45.759
certain way and then i realized like

00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:46.800
yeah it's not a good look

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.440
there's some bad people who dispose of

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.800
crosses that way and i don't want to

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.560
align myself with them all right

00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:00.880
i'm out of here y'all the best
