or not

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.840

man

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920

that's true

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.840
that's a fair point dude that's that's

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.239
the ultimate respect for one's business

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.920
not even acknowledging that they died

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.680
because you refused to gossip about them

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.280
yes but that's none of my business like

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.840

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.720
business nothing that's none of my

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.280
yeah like dude you should find the part

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.319
of your brain that holds that

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.000
information and jam a soldering iron

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.599
the less you know about anyone else the

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.840
better you are for sure that's the ideal

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.080
just a total island unto yourself yeah

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.760
every new fact you learn about another

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.599
man you descend further toward just

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.040
being a useless gay bird

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.280
so i try not to absorb even i'll hear it

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.040
sometimes i'm not along but i'm not

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.319
absorbing any of it man it's like

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.159
classical music for me do you think you

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.599
think you think when you're trans you

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.879
just all of a sudden like when you wake

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.319
up from the surgery you're like no

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.239
everyone's business

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.760
oh my god oh yeah it's like when coma

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.280
people wake up and they can talk chinese

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.560
or whatever you wake up you're just like

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.480
dmx is dead

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.879
oh my god once the estrogen hits your

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.400
system dude you can't help but learn

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.200
about other people

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.920
that is the ideal yeah you don't know

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.920
anything about it all that top surgery

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.680

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.919
learning about other people yeah

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.359
it changes your brain chemistry you

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.440
don't want to know anything about anyone

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.720
and then you just want to have very

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.720
surface level relationships just to get

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.240
physical needs met and that's it

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.199
anything other than that

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.240
other day and i was like cracking up at

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.319
the idea of my dental hygienist pulling

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:34.400
the prank of just putting her tit in my

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.039

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.440
did that

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:46.800
that would be a hilarious prank to pull

tit pranks yeah you [ __ ] up dude

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.599

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:52.800
it wasn't a prank before they get

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.440
fingered though yeah

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:04.800

that's what i thought

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:06.480
i had an eighth grader one time when i

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.680
was in sixth grade i was sitting there

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.360
and she laid down and put her tit right

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.639
on the back of my hand and i had a

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:12.320
similar thought where it's like

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.440
i'm gonna get in trouble for this

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.000
somehow yeah but i at a certain point i

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.519
just started going

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:20.639
i'm going to enjoy this though

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:23.040
and i just would sit there and there was

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.639
this memory it would just be like this

00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:26.560
this is cool i'm basically feeling up

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.320
right now this rules and it's probably

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.560
it's probably a tip prank i kind of got

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.040
like lightly tit pranked yeah but it was

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.079

put the earlier experience behind you or

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.440
was it just at the front of your brain

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.440
every morning you woke up like 10 years

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.640

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:02.240
dick when i was younger i was like i

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.880
must have a big dick i don't know why

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.160

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.160
just assumed i was a big dick so until i

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.640

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.400

another man's penis that's the biggest

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.440

immediately as soon as our lips touched

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.240
she went down and grabbed my dick

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.600

doing this how old when you went to the

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.480
carnival so this was like this was

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.559
probably 16.

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:22.799
so it was her job at the carnival

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:24.480
uh she was like

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.480
like a flexible

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.880
mythical yeah dude you're talking about

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.960

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.720
dude was too into like again it was too

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.799
intimidating it was too intimidating it

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:36.400
was like so we were like we were like

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.000
back behind a thing so like people would

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.360
walk by and we have to stop every now

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.039
and again yeah and every time she

00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:42.559
started back up she was like right where

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:44.240
are we like right where we left off how

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.360
old was she

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.480
she was probably she was a little older

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.640
than me if i remember that correctly

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.159
like she was sh i don't know if she was

00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:51.280
trying to like

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.600
take charge as the older person in the

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.600
situation or if she was like i'm only in

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.360
this town for one night i gotta get this

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.799
dick yeah i'm just so terrified of the

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:00.320
idea of like 17 year olds who have to

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.320
like [ __ ] strangers like that

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.919
he's like give me that [ __ ] dick

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:06.080
imagine if you if you were like a 17

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.200
year old that had the [ __ ] strangers

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.559
like that and then you got me who was

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:10.159
like denying it

00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:11.760
yeah seriously dick you're like whoa

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.159
you're gonna obstruct my posture yeah

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:15.760
well i haven't used all my tickets yet

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.840
hold on

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.080
jesus christ

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.080
it's like she was wasting she was like

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.919
grabbing from my dick over my shoulder

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:25.440
for other dicks to grab the whole entire

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.159
yeah it accidentally inhales his kazoo

00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:30.400
whoa

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.640
whoa my propeller hat's gonna fall off

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.919
what are you doing

00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:35.679
i mean that that was probably a blessing

00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:37.360
in disguise because if you got a taste

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.120
of carnival [ __ ] you would you might

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.200
have gone carney it's probably how you

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.440
join the circus she's a siren yeah she's

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.279
trying to snatch yeah dude you'd have

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:46.559
been stepped right up there you would

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:47.760
have been like we need someone to do all

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.600
of our homework

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.360
that also could have been like the day i

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.600
found out or like at least develop some

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.080
sort of weird subconsciousness about the

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.760
size of my dick i was just like a

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.480
contortionist really yeah it's like

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.600
that's cool that you went to a carnival

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.039
that had a contortionist my our

00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:04.400
carnival's growing up we're mostly just

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.480
like a gravitron and then like games

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.200
where you threw [ __ ] yeah yeah well like

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.640
pottstown was like one of these weird

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.640
places that would get

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.799
cool things that like people from all

00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:16.320
over the place would go to it was like a

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.279
strange like we had poss town had uh

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:21.520
this thing called the like rumble rumble

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.960
in the sand or whatever it was called it

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.200
was a national beach volleyball

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.480
tournament

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.159
where like big time professional

00:24:28.159 --> 00:24:30.640
volleyball players would come to play

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.960
and they would like bring in sand for it

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.080
to say why did they do that in

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.679
norristown

00:24:35.679 --> 00:24:37.919
it's land locked yeah

00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:39.840
that was possible

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.039
we don't [ __ ] with north sound like that

00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:42.000
i'm sorry i wonder if it's trying to

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.279
start beef though i wonder if it's like

00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:45.120
the pro bowling circle

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.480
if you have a professional sport that's

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.080
small enough you could just hit up small

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.840
towns and do like very inexpensive

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.039
events because you're trying to hook the

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:52.960
youth on it like that's the whole point

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.400
of like bowling

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.240
is that like bowling alleys and [ __ ] are

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.520
just like basically trying to get kids

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.120
to bowl for free so that they'll like

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.960
enjoy the sport and pursue it yeah

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.679
they're probably doing something with

00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:02.880
volleyball look at our kids we're coming

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.440
to your table well there's also a global

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.240
hot air balloon tournament like uh race

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.600
that starts in and ends in potsdam what

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.080
yeah the hell wow yeah that's awesome so

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.080
the the fair the [ __ ] carnival that

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.399
experience he didn't even have a car in

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:40.720

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.200
back onto a street with a poppy i'd kill

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.880
myself

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.799
it was hell dude

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:10.320

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.080
salvation army exists but if i had to

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.000

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.240
out you know what i mean yeah pop might

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.159
be pointing the way out of the hood once

00:29:28.159 --> 00:29:30.080

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.560
tragic for the mathematician to not

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.200

like that and then yo and then the whole

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.400
like so he came back four days later and

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.920
he was so [ __ ] depressed because like

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.920
back then the thing was if you were like

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.200
on e and you [ __ ] then your sensation

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.599
would go away so he was like

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:33.200
so depressed about the idea of all that

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.800
[ __ ] meaning that he'd never be able

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.200
to [ __ ] again and feel it again so he

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.119
was just sad victor for the rest of the

00:41:39.119 --> 00:41:41.760
year what dude it changed his life wait

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.599
what was he afraid of if you they're

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:44.880
saying if you have sex that was the

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.920
thing like they used to say like if you

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.520
had sex on like back then when it was

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.720
ecstasy

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.079
like you'll never be able to have

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:52.160
regular sex ever yet oh that's

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.480
terrifying yeah okay yeah i believe i

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.760
remember fully being like yeah that's

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.680
definitely that he like and i think it

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.760
was e back then but he had done so much

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.040
e yeah that he was convinced that this

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.880
had to be what was happening to him he

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.400
was like it's just not yeah it's not the

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.760
same and then uh so there was this

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.480
exhibitionist couple that uh

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.800
that was like lived in his dorm

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.359
a floor below him and i went to his room

00:42:15.359 --> 00:42:16.640
one time trying to cheer him up like

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.960
victor dude come on you know like there

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.880
was a couple there that would just watch

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.480
no no they would they would [ __ ] with

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.280
their door open oh so you'd be walking

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.119
past the hall and like you'd be able to

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:30.560
look directly into the room gotcha

00:42:31.359 --> 00:42:33.359
yeah i thought you said there was a hole

00:42:33.359 --> 00:42:35.520
in the floor i was like no

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.960
no no i thought you're hitting me with a

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.640
place in france or naked ladies dance

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.319
dude

00:42:40.319 --> 00:42:42.400
i was like what the [ __ ] school were you

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.040
at

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.200
now this couple used to [ __ ] like we

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.720
would have had something called spinning

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.000
which was just a dance party where

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.599
everybody go to a frat and just dance

00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:51.040
yeah and uh

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.960
they would go in the corner and just

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.079
[ __ ]

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:56.560
what and like

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.079
just let i mean i would watch yeah i

00:42:58.079 --> 00:42:59.599
mean obviously yeah yeah yeah yeah i

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:01.359
just i don't know if it was happening in

00:43:01.359 --> 00:43:02.480
person i don't know if i would watch the

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.680
whole thing i think i'd check it out for

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.880
a little bit and be like

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.319
yeah did the dude eventually come when

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:07.520
he'd be like yeah well no that's the

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.280
thing like he was like he has some

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.839
longevity man and and even like you know

00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:13.200
you check it out you're like yeah it's

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.960
cool but then another person comes up

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.640
and then you're just like talking and

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.920
that's like the center piece of the

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.400
party now so you're still enjoying the

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.560

it's time we're it's time to get

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.200
too high and then

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.920
launch into the forbidden zone really

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.680
yeah launching we're descending into the

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.839
different zone yeah let's uh let's fire

00:44:31.839 --> 00:44:34.000
up some [ __ ] sweet

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.720
but yeah dude i actually had a um

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.640
i had a thought today while i was

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.839
walking i'm trying to figure out

00:44:41.839 --> 00:44:43.680
the exact brain worm everyone has in

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.040
their head or the majority of people i

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.800
should say who are just bugging out and

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.400
having a bad time i want to like figure

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.400
out like what is the

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.920
like the line of code that's going

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.720
through their head that's like

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.960
convincing people to bug the [ __ ] out

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.760
be

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.920
nasty that's a great that's a great line

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.480
to go down yeah i was kind of uh

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.440
sitting there today i was like i'm gonna

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.800
really try to figure out what it is that

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.800
has everyone in the tizzy and eliminate

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.480
it from human consciousness i think part

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.079
of it is that like uh

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.720
like it seems like there's so okay so

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.160
remember when you were a kid

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.400
and like a cool movie was coming out

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.920
there would be like three or four months

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.480
where you'd be like man i cannot wait

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.920
i cannot wait to see jurassic park you

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.760
know what i mean true now it's like

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.599
three days a week there's the new

00:45:25.599 --> 00:45:27.280
biggest thing that you've ever

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.040
experienced is about to launch you know

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.040
what i mean it's constant you're being

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.599
hit constantly is it dopamine or

00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:35.280
dolphins probably dopamine i don't know

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.280
to be honest but it's

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.839
brain chemicals every every day you have

00:45:39.839 --> 00:45:41.520
a chance to see the new coolest thing

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.200
you've ever seen in your entire life and

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.560
then the fact of the matter is though

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.000
it's like most of the [ __ ] is just like

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.040
hollow cheap cardboard entertainment and

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.200
and thoughts you know yeah so you're

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.480
living your life

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.800
as though you're constantly at the peak

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.119
you're hitting like every day you like

00:45:57.119 --> 00:45:58.880
you're you're watching stuff that

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.240
compared to like what you were raised on

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.800
looks so cool and is such a spectacle

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.920
that you're like this is clearly the

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.520
pinnacle of humanity but at the same

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.599
time people are just

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:08.960
they're doing that instead of like

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.400
cultivating any kind of meaningful

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.920
personal life

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.680
yeah and that that emptiness right there

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.920
is like i think to me it's somewhere

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.440
near like the answer of why people are

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.079
spinning out they're also so i'm like i

00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:24.079
have a friend an adult friend who is uh

00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:26.480
you know like close to her 40s yeah

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.960
and she's just now coming to terms with

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.240
the idea

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.760
that

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.520
she's not the only person with that

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.560
voice in her head that's like you

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.160
[ __ ] suck

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.200
really yeah she she she was convinced

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.680
until very recently that everybody else

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.240
that that well adjusted meant you didn't

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.079
have that

00:46:46.079 --> 00:46:47.920
you know like so she

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.760
was just convinced that she was just not

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.960
a well-adjusted person she actually must

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.560
like if nobody else is having this voice

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.319
in her head telling him they suck then

00:46:56.319 --> 00:46:58.400
she must act then i guess i [ __ ]

00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.760
actually suck

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.839
like my voice must be telling me

00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:03.440
like that voice in my head must be the

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.400
truth

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.319
damn she assumed that nobody else thinks

00:47:06.319 --> 00:47:08.000
they suck yeah

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.440
yeah it's crazy like she was the only

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.800
person that existed with that sort of

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.560
static in their mind and i think that's

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.920
like like what

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.359
tim was like to piggyback on what tim is

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:16.640
saying like i'm not gonna piggyback on a

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.800
man but you know

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.800
yeah

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.800
but like it's just it's just heightening

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.200
the idea of that chasm

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.640
where it's like [ __ ] look at these

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.520
people

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.079
having such fun watching these

00:47:34.079 --> 00:47:36.000
internet videos

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:36.880
like

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.880
they they don't like giggle for a second

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.000
at this video and then go back to

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.960
thinking about how much their life sucks

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.319
right which is what

00:47:44.319 --> 00:47:46.000
almost that is almost the universal

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.280
experience right now yeah that's why

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.280
we're thankful that the algorithm shows

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.359
us another video right away

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:54.480
all right that's right yeah

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.960
um

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.400
yeah i don't know i it's hard to talk

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.000
about it without saying something that

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.520
will just bum people out more

00:48:04.839 --> 00:48:07.119
yeah i'm gonna try to figure out exactly

00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:09.359
what it is

00:48:09.359 --> 00:48:11.440
porn's too specific like everyone has

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.640
exactly their like ultimate idea ready

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.160
at any given time

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:20.359
that's probably spinning dudes out

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.640
oh everyone's fat that's not good yeah

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.760
it's not good at all yeah that's

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.359
probably a large part of it people are

00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:27.520
saying everybody people are unhealthy

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.880
maybe i should skip the line of code and

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.240
go right to the fact that everyone's fat

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.839
yeah yeah

00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:33.599
yeah that's a i mean

00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:35.440
biologically that's kind of a success

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.800
for the species

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.880
yeah you know what i'm saying

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.200
theoretically that exactly theoretically

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.960
we thought this is what we wanted yeah

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.079
that was the dream back in the day it's

00:48:44.079 --> 00:48:46.319
like so happy just getting fat as hell

00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:48.240
yeah dude it was probably so hard to get

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.760
fat like the genuinely hard to get fat

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.400
you'd be fat and be like yes dude yeah

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.480
we need to go back to that also too just

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.240
like just walking around barefoot to

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.079
film the earth on your feet man yeah

00:48:58.079 --> 00:48:59.920
that's why that's why like the big

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.280
insult on the internet right now is go

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.800
touch grass

00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:38.559
two abandoned things on the trails near

00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:41.040
my house number one there was what was

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.760
clearly like an indoor structure in the

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.640
in the park and it was burnt down and

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.839
the only thing that remains is the

00:49:47.839 --> 00:49:49.200
chimney

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.640
so it's like a perfectly level

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:54.000
foundation with nothing on it except a

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.480
very uh old looking chimney in the woods

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.200
and then you go like a mile past that

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.920
and there's an amphitheater like a

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.680
concrete amphitheater in the middle of

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.599
nowhere in the woods

was talking about she didn't realize

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.040
that all the extracurricular [ __ ] that

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.200
people were doing they were doing to

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.240
quiet that voice

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.079
you're fighting the uh oh didn't you

00:51:50.079 --> 00:51:51.359
call this something the goblin or

00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:52.880
something like that dark album the dark

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.400
goblin yeah you should have you should

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.000
have let her have that been like yeah no

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.559
yeah i mean no yeah no never question

00:51:58.559 --> 00:52:00.480
now life is just me just having ideas

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.880
make oh yeah great awesome perfect yeah

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.240
i would have got mad at her for

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.079
suggesting that there's a possibility

00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:08.000
that there's a voice that says i suck

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:08.880
yeah

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.079
i'm like

00:52:10.079 --> 00:52:11.599
what are you trying to plant that in my

00:52:11.599 --> 00:52:13.760
brain yeah my voice be like yo you suck

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.960
josh i'm just kidding you don't suck

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.720
yeah that must have been freeing for her

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.400
to learn that other people thought like

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.520
that

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.000
she still again like a revelation like

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.400
that it's not it does that's a snap

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.160
she's still coming to terms with it then

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.119
she'll go through a week where she

00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:28.640
doesn't believe it anymore does she ever

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.960
see like any movies that a guy's like

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.680
i'm doubting myself or like

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.640
like how would you yeah that's like

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.640
wizards man it's not it's just made up

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.119
for movies

00:52:40.079 --> 00:52:42.240
you guys ever see x-men you know

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:42.960
that's

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.640
essentially what you're saying

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.640
i wanted i want to preserve this thought

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.839
i feel like she needs to have this

00:52:47.839 --> 00:52:49.119
thought like she's the only person in

00:52:49.119 --> 00:52:51.680
the world who has negative thinking

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:52.960
i might have to preserve that like no

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.839
you're absolutely you're right

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.680
because that would be almost too weird

00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.960
to be like no that's how everybody

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.680
thinks is there to be like wait what

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.960
again i mean i think they're i think

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.480
that voice

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.079
has the potential to be in everybody's

00:53:06.079 --> 00:53:07.680
mind i mean my voice again my voice is

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.480
pretty supportive yeah i i have a i

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.000
don't know never really thought about it

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
like that i think i have total [ __ ]

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.960
crank just like you idiot you know what

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.599
are you doing you idiot this is uh this

00:53:19.599 --> 00:53:22.319
is the weed talking but i think uh i get

00:53:22.319 --> 00:53:24.240
i might get angrier than anybody in the

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.000
world every time they show a new

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.480
spider-man give up in the movie when

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:29.839
every time a spider-man is like i can't

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:31.680
be spider-man anymore i'm like what the

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.040
[ __ ] dude

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.359
stop

00:53:35.359 --> 00:53:37.119
don't do that yeah

00:53:37.119 --> 00:53:38.720
kids are watching

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.640
every time every spider-man gives up for

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:41.920
at least a couple of scenes and i'm just

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.700
like knock it off yeah this sucks

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:49.520
[Laughter]

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.440
dude i've i've never recovered from toby

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.520
mcguire giving the [ __ ] up and i think

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.640
he does it in every movie he doesn't

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.680
know all three movies like i can't

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.599
[ __ ] do this anymore it's like shut

00:53:57.599 --> 00:53:59.680
the [ __ ] up dude well then you get the

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.440
real anxiety of like

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.880
nova for real what if this is the one

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.800
where spider-man does give up bro it

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.640
gets you every single time any of those

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.640
movies like i'd watch the avengers with

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.480
uh with britney all the time and like

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.400
whenever they're like forget it man we

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.040
just don't get along that well this time

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.480
let's just leave the world to [ __ ]

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.400
thinners i'm always like

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.079
there's a part of me that's genuinely

00:54:20.079 --> 00:54:22.319
like like i'm sitting there like it

00:54:22.319 --> 00:54:24.880
makes me so mad i get nervous it's not

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.280
even about you guys i mean it's really i

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.440
i guess like i'm like relaxed they're

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.880
definitely gonna get back to play and

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.559
they always get me like they actually

00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:34.480
might not this time

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.319
like cool guys did you start like wait

00:54:36.319 --> 00:54:38.240
was there like a contract problem where

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.000
like robert downey jr

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.839
did i read something about that is this

00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:44.799
the last time that they worked together

00:54:44.799 --> 00:54:46.480
i see this is why we shouldn't be

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.760
relying on a group of white people to

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.119
save us

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:50.880
and then like there's another level to

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.400
it where you're like so even if i was

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.599
that cool i would still think i suck

00:54:55.599 --> 00:54:57.680
[ __ ] yeah man that maybe that's why

00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:59.520
yeah they might they might have created

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.440
that lady's thought process

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.359
yeah i mean lay off the superhero movies

00:55:03.359 --> 00:55:06.079
because they're ruining her brain

00:55:06.079 --> 00:55:07.839
