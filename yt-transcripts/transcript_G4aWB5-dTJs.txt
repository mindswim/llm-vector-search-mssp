00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.440
literally

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.600
it's almost like you're protected to the

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.039
point where like even the stuff that

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.560
would cling to your like

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.759

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.960
every day

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.560
i might just do personal policy to keep

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.400
myself fast does it feel like you [ __ ]

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.759
your pants

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.280

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.880
vagina for a butt

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.120

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.560
like i've used preparation h

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.840

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.000

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.840
it on my underwear or whatever

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:49.900
[Laughter]

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.360
just looking at mexicans like huh

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.679
yeah seriously you want to say sorry

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:57.120

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.120
yeah man texas is perfect it fits yeah

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.640
it's like that perfect shape for america

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.159
it is the perfect shape yeah what the

00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:05.280
hell were they thinking i don't know why

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.799
they thought it was theirs

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:08.080
yeah exactly came down and gave them

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.919
what for yeah well we i think we

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:12.000
snatched the texas a little bit

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.200
totally 100 but it remembered that uh

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.640
it's a weird shape of a thing it was a

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.080
bunch of people came down and settled

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:18.799
settled

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:22.240
in texas just white settlers came in and

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.039
the mexicans at first were cool with it

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:26.960
because they provided a buffer zone from

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.480
the engines

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.880
right so then eventually all the white

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.400
settlers came down and started [ __ ]

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.240
up the indians too and then they were

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.760
like we're gonna [ __ ] mexicans up too

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.480
now

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.000
and then the met you know mexicans are

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.120
like whoa they were like we thought

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.960
these comanches were bad

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.559
let's get some white people to kind of

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:43.919
let the comanches kill them and it

00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:46.000
turned out the white people were just

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.360
rudeness dude i'll say this uh

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.960
you know everyone's pretty chill to

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.080
white people when they first meet them

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.200
everyone's like these guys are pretty

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.080
cool oh yeah yeah

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.799
everybody seem pretty docile yeah

00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:58.240
everybody's real nice

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.159
basically white people are like the good

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:01.600
good of

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.960
like you're like these guys seem pretty

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.320
nice and then like a week later they're

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.200

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.930

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.840
that was that was a funny thing i didn't

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.520
even i never thought about but

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.679
comedy clubs they kind of especially

00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:19.520
when the comedian wants to cancel

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.480
yeah they're like when the there's like

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.440
a game of

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.200
chicken between the club and the

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.799
comedian of being like

00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:28.240
the comedian's like you should cancel

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.840
and i should get my guarantee

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.440
yeah but the club will be like we're not

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.120
[ __ ] paying you we're doing the show

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.880
yeah exactly you got to see if you can

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.480
make it down here

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.320
yeah you know well i mean what would

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.799
happen if the comedian didn't show

00:23:40.799 --> 00:23:42.240
then it would just they would cancel the

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.600
show but then they the club wouldn't

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.880
have to pay him the guarantee so the

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.679
comedian tends to try to be like

00:23:47.679 --> 00:23:50.240
i'm coming yeah you guys have to cancel

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:50.880
so then they

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.320
you know pay we're not [ __ ] cancer

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.600
and then both sides are like we're not

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.799
cancelling them we're doing this show in

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:55.919

their demands their demands are i think

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.320
we're like a 15 page

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.880
like document but part of it was like we

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.320
want you to build

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.960
uh take there's a statue that needed to

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.679
come down

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:08.799
someone one of like the original

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:11.360
benefactors had a problem with the jews

[ __ ] oh yeah they have christie

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.520
yeah also if you founded a university

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.720
you had them oh

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.159
yeah everything yeah what the [ __ ] every

00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:26.399
single university for sure yeah i even

00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:27.760
think about that i think chapel hill was

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.279
like built by slaves

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:32.320

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.760
yeah that's true dude if it's good i

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.360
think we should undo all the work of the

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.399
slaves

00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:38.559
that'd be tight you know who do you

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:42.159
think we should have uh although

00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:44.880
their whole lives were yeah we should

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.080
take down the pyramids

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.880
true we should undo what the [ __ ] dude

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.799
i'm pissed

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:53.360
you know someone yeah exactly someone

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.720
who's one percent jewish according to

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.320
ancestry.com

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.760
yeah no that was that was that was a

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.880
[ __ ] up situation i think it's a

00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.840
little higher than that

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.760
it's not my [ __ ] you know what you

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.919
know

00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:08.559
i am i do got school you always scheme

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:10.000
that's the one it's good though because

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.120
you're not this is racist this is uh

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.320

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.880
percent

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.640
so like you can come up with the schemes

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.200
but you can't fully execute them true

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.159
it's just schemes just that one percent

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:25.279
in you that's like

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:28.320

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.679

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.639
frenzy of evil hippies once there's

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.399

00:34:46.399 --> 00:34:49.040
swarm of people like they're like ants

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.320
they are

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.800
trying to get in this evil hippie was

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.159
lurking around noah

studied as a chemical

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.440
it's a research chemical that is

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.119
apparently helping a lot of people so

00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:17.280
i should give her molly she would enjoy

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.320
it i

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.079
only pray i mean dude they will be by

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:21.839
the time our parents hate to say it or

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:23.200

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:28.880
out

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.720
so she had to go back and then get the

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.960
other three so she had a week of

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.359
one wisdom tooth coming out and then she

i watched a documentary about weed and

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.000
this could have been fear propaganda for

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.440
the legal weed market

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.119
um but they were talking about i think

00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:37.440
it was another country in germany maybe

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.960
where they're saying a lot of the weed

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.720
on the black market is being sprayed now

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.880
with that synthetic cannabinoids

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.440
so like you know like spice and k2 you

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.480

one of the times that i thought i got

00:51:10.079 --> 00:51:11.520

not that many certainly yeah we didn't

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.760
do that but they're doing the

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.359
documentary they're saying a lot of

00:51:49.359 --> 00:51:50.960
this guy can't it was a vice documentary

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.280
he was like he came out he was a weed

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.960
dealer and he was like i i can't keep

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:55.839
doing this because

00:51:55.839 --> 00:51:57.359
i know this stuff is sprayed with a

00:51:57.359 --> 00:51:58.960
synthetic cannabinoid

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.040
and once people start smoking that they

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.400
go dude they start you know because

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.520
you just have strain names and

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.280
everything so give me that stuff and the

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.800
strains that start to get requested

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.800
are the synthetic cannabinoid ones and

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.319
he's like and it's like it's like

00:52:10.319 --> 00:52:12.400
addictive addictive so these people are

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.520
getting addicted to synthetic

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.880
cannabinoids they think they're just

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.640
smoking regular weed

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.319
but then you start getting the push of

00:52:18.319 --> 00:52:19.760
the big legal weed companies and they

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.280
did it with the cartridges

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:22.400
i mean obviously there probably were

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.640
some bad ones killing people dude they

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:24.960
all

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.079
they're going to start fear-mongering

00:52:26.079 --> 00:52:27.599
hard on the illegal that's how i think

00:52:27.599 --> 00:52:28.559
they're going to control yeah

00:52:28.559 --> 00:52:29.520
sounds like how they're going to control

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.160
this they're going to start

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.000
fear-mongering but it also

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.680
at the same time you start to know if

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.280
you know like the [ __ ] organized

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.920
crime type cartel gangster type dudes

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.520
they'll spray that [ __ ] on there 100 100

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.640
yeah so so keep an eye out for that

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.559
yeah i'm just saying look after what the

00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:48.400
whole point is yeah i got that yeah and

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:48.800
then

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.000
people are like hey you want to try this

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.599
powder i bought off this [ __ ] guy i'm

00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:52.000

no yeah that's that's me dude

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.480
again true i'm not stopping anyone's

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.240
party but it's like

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.880
i'm i'm so [ __ ] terrified of that i

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.160
know dudes used to do coke and be like

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.440
yeah man it sucks when it's cut with

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.680
baby laxative and i'm like

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.040
yeah you just roll the dice

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.480
they're like yeah you know i [ __ ]

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.280
[ __ ] myself one time

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.960
you got to send the evil hippies out

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.640
like space chimps

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.000
you launch a couple of that you launch a

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.440
couple of them up into space and you're

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.599
like all right how'd they do

00:53:21.599 --> 00:53:24.400
i'll do it no that's true but some of

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.839
them are too strong

00:53:25.839 --> 00:53:28.160
the evil hippies big j might be an evil

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.119
hippie dude

00:53:29.119 --> 00:53:31.760
could be he just swallowed that walked

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.319
through it

00:53:32.319 --> 00:53:34.079
drug monster dude he was some people are

00:53:34.079 --> 00:53:35.839
drug monsters i was looking at everybody

00:53:35.839 --> 00:53:37.359
they're like it's great it's fine

00:53:37.359 --> 00:53:43.599
and i took it and i was like oh yeah oh

00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.680
like

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.440

that works out also too we'll do in the

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.720
patreon i have a theory about how

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.559
this planet how we experience light on

01:07:48.559 --> 01:07:49.760
this planet when if you go to outer

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.440
space is dark but there's parts of outer

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.880
space that are closer to the sun

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.880
how does that even work we'll figure it

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.559
out later don't put your don't don't

01:07:56.559 --> 01:07:57.440

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.440
we'll discuss all right kind of weird

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.440
though right what the

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.839
how is it light here yeah but then if

01:08:03.839 --> 01:08:07.200
you go in outer space it's dark

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.400
the light is a reflection what we see is

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.520

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.880

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.640
i figured they were called but it was

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.640
like they had one night where they were

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.159
just like black dudes would roast each

01:10:26.159 --> 01:10:26.880
other's clothes

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.280
for like an hour it was the funniest

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.239
[ __ ] thing to watch

01:10:30.239 --> 01:10:32.640

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.520
dude dude

01:10:36.719 --> 01:10:38.239
into like a [ __ ]

01:10:38.239 --> 01:10:40.159
like it's clearly just a gear battle

01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:41.360
it's a hundred percent of gear and they

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.800
would just both shred each other's gear

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.560
they wore their best gear and have your

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.920
best gear get shredded in front of

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.960
everyone you're just like

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.560
[ __ ] dude yeah but the best gear is

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.480
outrageous it's like a [ __ ]

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.400
bubble vest with like a russian fur hat

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.440

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.280
today walking in the middle you know

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.480
his defense he's in the middle of the

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.480
street but the sidewalks are like snowed

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:04.719

i'm just like i'm driving i'm like

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.400
i wish this guy wasn't here and he like

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.679

01:11:11.679 --> 01:11:12.719

01:11:12.719 --> 01:11:14.800
like almost as if i was like zooming up

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.640
yeah the back of his sweatshirt said

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.080

you're being a [ __ ]

01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:26.800
also the karma of walking in the street

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.159
yeah that's a quick one to get rid of

01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:29.280
well again it was this

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.280

01:11:40.719 --> 01:11:42.159
[ __ ] like footage yeah
