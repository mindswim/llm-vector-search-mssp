00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.899
course yeah your big Gamecock guys if

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.380
you had to guess how do you think Notre

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.430
Dame is gonna do this year what do you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.750
think their records gonna be I think I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.979
nailed it last year I was pretty close

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.310
you probably wouldn't think I'm gonna

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.799
say 13 and 2 that's pretty good that's

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.210
great I think I said if you go back and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.399
just get an extra game in ya Bowl game

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.989
obviously I'm playing for the bowl well

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.840
no that's on top oh no you know what

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.120
sugar bowl the most Notre Dame can play

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.260
is 14th if they want a playoff game and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.030
the championship yeah so what actually

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.239
13 into 13 season dude if it's just a

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.870
bowl game but yeah all preseason camp

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.400
Ian ship they were in the bowl game they

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.550
play the championship I know but they

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.290
win the first round playoff then they

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.470
have 15 games total exactly 14 for no

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.720
but if they win that they let me play

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.390

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.270
who gets high scores are definitely more

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.560
likely to beat their girlfriends

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.660
absolutely so if you like a 25 a chick

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.220
should be shaken if some dude goes in

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.990
like solid connection rocks at there's

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.250
no problem it's like he'll probably beat

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.550
you

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.810
especially because probably when they

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.520
got to the bar he was like now I'm not

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.030
gonna do that

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.360
yeah couple shots at some shot a

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.740
fireball you're like well I'm gonna set

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.990
the record right now move I have the

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.090
strongest punch of all my friends watch

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.170
this babe

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.690
behold your future yeah they should take

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.810
that game out ya already have Golden Tee

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.220
dude I'm spin there ya go

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.050
watch what's a gentleman's game yeah

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:19.760
although those dudes [ __ ] rock those

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.040
you ever see actually people play hard

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.380
that's good that's a good indicator of

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.300
like AAA if you get like if you get like

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.070
as soon as you score a hundred thousand

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.080
on gold and tbh congratulations here's

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.570
your local lodge dude [ __ ] alcohol

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:43.030
like it out those are three initials hi

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.000
I'm JK are from petty Oh Rooney's down

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.800
on Westchester place you probably see my

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.720
top three Oh Golden Tee like damn dude

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.160
you're Jake you're my boys love I've

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.380
always loved going TV back home oh yeah

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:02.000
oops a scientific study of like Golden

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.980
Tee scores like liver cells and like

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.870
there's definitely a connection there's

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.720
a positive correlation man that's that's

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:15.470
uh that's really funny thanks give you

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:22.130
directions to the church speaking of

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.640
wonky research there was a Cornell just

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.410
let out of study so go ahead please

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.260
Cornell just let out of study about they

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.820
were trying to study machine learning

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.800
algorithms in turn and so like when

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.900
things get flogged from from Twitter for

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.040
being racist

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.590
we're like hurtful or abusive there's

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.250
like specific like there's like

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.780
algorithms that like have certain words

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.980
in the study algorithm yeah gay Rito now

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.320
yeah yeah exactly but here's a problem

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.820
dude if you're gay [ __ ] you're allowed

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.040
to say gay [ __ ] so they were doing

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:56.940
these things they're saying they're

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:02.360
saying they're like for the sake guys

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.270
there are no gay retards alright I'm

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.880
talking I'm like in I hopefully you can

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.980
entertain I'm in machine you or if you

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.400
are mentally handicapped sure you love

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.530
that's the one thing unites the yeah

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.320
that's undeniable okay my thing is I'm

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.700
talking as a strict I'm talking about

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.310
programming classifiers I'm talking at

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.500
from a machine learning perspective so

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.180
you're like have all this human mess I'm

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.890
in the [ __ ] matrix right now just

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.480
talking about like different classifiers

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.670
they have different classifiers for GA

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.790
verse ER oh so if you track the end

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:36.720
that's the thing like they were saying

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.010
our word machine there's a servers the

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:45.240
Terminator dude it's a turn or you throw

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:50.130
a hard R John Connors comes for you use

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.660
the hard yes so they have the they have

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.010
a ways that you do Arnold he has a hard

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:07.290
[Laughter]

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.260
well do word machine learning we're only

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.090
talking Twitter we're talking machine

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.680
learning we're talking about classify I

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.180
learned about this because I emailed the

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.860
researchers dude for clarification last

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.410
night yeah I was up in bed in between

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.850
waiting for my troops to spawn from

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.720
classic I just dropped 40 bucks awesome

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.950
no no dude I have this thing called a

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:41.430
war machine I'm spending on the most

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.290
pointless thing you think that go that

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.220
goes straight to China

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.890
clash of clans dude you know when I see

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.540
those little symbols it gets personal I

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.850
fight i invade China all the time [ __ ]

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:55.140
the [ __ ] up I I see that [ __ ] I see

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.910
some tattoos oh my god [ __ ]

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:57.929
let's get wing

guys run it they're running all [ __ ]

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:03.269
high why dude they're [ __ ] flying Wow

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:04.649
yeah I see the wing-dings and I'm like

00:20:04.649 --> 00:20:06.720
my laces like I boys let's [ __ ] go I

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.279
was gonna I was gonna send some goblins

in to steal your gold and [ __ ] dark

00:20:10.049 --> 00:20:12.059

00:20:12.059 --> 00:20:14.039
town centre really let you guys know

00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:15.570
that communism isn't [ __ ] far so I

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.220
get what yeah are you sure he's Chinese

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.929
wing-dings people catching some flak if

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:25.110
I see you I'm going if you see something

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.309
that's not English I'll get them back

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.980
for Pearl Harbor do not give a [ __ ] if I

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.200
see some [ __ ] I'm going in I'm like [ __ ]

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.499
really though if I dude I basically it's

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:37.080
so unfair because the level on it it

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.279
should have taken me forever like

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:40.379
upgrade my gold in my elixir storages

00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:42.480
yeah get the war machine do you

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.429
understand it's the broken-down war

00:20:44.429 --> 00:20:49.080
machine dude that's high it is bad see

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.080
somebody's Japanese like castle names

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.570
like [ __ ] Pearl Harbor oh my god I'm

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.549
sitting in the Archer Queen it's

00:20:59.549 --> 00:21:01.499
unbelievable dude healers above you so

00:21:01.499 --> 00:21:02.789
the archer Queen can run forever if you

00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:04.830
put like three healers up and like I'm

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.659
talking 120 people at the bows level you

00:21:06.659 --> 00:21:17.460
have the Japanese like oh we watch the

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.200
replay of people attacking you so it's

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.220
definitely isn't 75 Archer Queens come

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.080
on the perimeter or 75 little archers

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:37.950
definitely the noise they're making like

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:43.080
Scrolls of you in Japan how the whole

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.619
level 8 somehow has war machine how

00:21:45.619 --> 00:21:50.570
[ __ ] muscle spend of what the dollar

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.220
trying to get technically diva you could

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.629
devalue their currency the Chinese

00:21:54.629 --> 00:21:56.159
probably have every [ __ ] little thing

00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:57.529
oh they devalue they probably

00:21:57.529 --> 00:21:59.669
reverse-engineered my war machine do you

00:21:59.669 --> 00:22:01.440
think baby

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.470
that they're devaluing the N in order to

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:05.970
[ __ ] take me down take down the

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.480
ultimate the mask of more Costco for

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.039
sure I'm gonna go on the record and say

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:14.539
that's exactly why they bill on Yui

00:22:14.539 --> 00:22:18.139
Oliver clash of clans might be oh my god

00:22:18.139 --> 00:22:21.600
how would the Chinese say what a clash

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.639
of clans yeah that's how we should do it

00:22:26.639 --> 00:22:28.230
for no look crash I think of something

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:35.580
racist so this very cute amen I'm so

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:41.750
quick crash crash crash crash crash

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.769
wonder what did the name of it is in

00:22:43.769 --> 00:23:07.980
Chinese Costco have you see it we just

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:08.570
watched

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:14.730
Bellary most recent special fantastic is

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.279
so [ __ ] good yeah it's good good lord

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:20.159
dude that was a total time that was a

00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:21.809
total touched it was I mean that was

00:23:21.809 --> 00:23:25.200
like he was listening to the cast I mean

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.700
that was moonwalking in the endzone the

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:31.409
entire time dude so that that was sorry

00:23:31.409 --> 00:23:33.840
that's up to the crash please that ties

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.450
me all in that's special so here's what

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.620
happened they did they studied the

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.090
machine learning

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.250
did the see who's getting flagged and

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:42.629
then they did like so they had like five

00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:43.980
different data sets that were studied

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.169
before it was weird I didn't understand

00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:47.490
how those the first studies were like

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.850
they would have them judged by gender

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.340
studies student no yeah dude a gender

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.450
studies student and they said a

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.399
politically inactive feminist which I

00:23:56.399 --> 00:23:57.840
don't [ __ ] know what that means I

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.529
guess it's a female comedian so like it

00:24:01.529 --> 00:24:03.389
was a it was a feminist who was in act

00:24:03.389 --> 00:24:05.639
like they weren't at the moment taking

00:24:05.639 --> 00:24:06.960
pictures of themselves and putting it on

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.820
Facebook yeah so was a gender studies

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.559
between that was the two judges like

00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:11.789
make sure like things weren't getting

00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:13.320
like you know jumbled an overlock that's

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:13.929
exactly

00:24:13.929 --> 00:24:17.080
deciding cultural yeah dude exactly it

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.789
was it was created to be able to be like

00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:20.470
hey Twitter sorry but your algorithms

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.659
are racist we have a they literally said

00:24:22.659 --> 00:24:24.549
it quotes 25 year-old Gender Studies

00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:27.879
major to go through you know thousands

00:24:27.879 --> 00:24:29.350
of tweets but they're a dominant

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.230
[ __ ] on earth no than a 25 year

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.559
old Gender Studies major no I mean wow

00:24:35.559 --> 00:24:38.860
that's like it's literally you're going

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.570
to school and your heads being filled

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.429
with [ __ ] you might as well blue I would

00:24:42.429 --> 00:24:43.809
pay money not to be a Gender Studies

00:24:43.809 --> 00:24:45.970
major like you said you you're paying to

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.070
get a degree on boys and girls yeah the

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.720
boys are meaning the girls dude boys I

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.759
mean - the girls those your degree today

00:24:51.759 --> 00:24:54.279
those boys maybe the girls in hers the

00:24:54.279 --> 00:24:56.230
girls the girls wanted to be like the

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.179
boys and boys mean - goose yeah it's

00:24:58.179 --> 00:25:01.470
[ __ ] [ __ ] so they found out that

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:06.190
they found out that the so they the null

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.309
hypothesis - HL if it's too much drawing

00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:10.509
I don't don't worry about it was tight

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.249
actually understood the research hey Joe

00:25:12.249 --> 00:25:13.840
a Chosen oh my father they're gonna have

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.669
to change that so the null hypothesis

00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:16.990
and research you assume there's no

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:20.230
relation between the race of the user

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.119
and their the amount that they

00:25:22.119 --> 00:25:24.759
likelihood of them being you know kicked

00:25:24.759 --> 00:25:28.539
off a Twitter whatever reported so but

00:25:28.539 --> 00:25:29.529
it was funny cuz they can't you know

00:25:29.529 --> 00:25:30.669
they can't get the race so they had to

00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:33.429
go through the lexicon and be like they

00:25:33.429 --> 00:25:34.960
would call him an African American

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.549
English they would say in standard

00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:38.529
American English like so they would say

00:25:38.529 --> 00:25:40.269
like that terminology yeah so they were

00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:42.279
trying to figure out there by being able

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:44.799
to you know nerd or african-american by

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:46.840
proxy to figure out like the race of

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.940
people they would use machine another

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.409
machine learning algorithm to determine

00:25:50.409 --> 00:25:51.940
you know they test like it could

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.649
determine upon frequency of like the way

00:25:53.649 --> 00:25:54.669
someone tweeted if they were white or

00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:56.950
black so not everyone is everybody was

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.749
like if you use that type of yeah

00:25:58.749 --> 00:26:00.220
they're trying to say like if you're

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.549
tweeting out Dragon Ball Z memes you are

00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:06.309
African if you started with brah then

00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:07.929
there's a [ __ ] yeah it's like that's

00:26:07.929 --> 00:26:11.740
it so if you were using AAA then they're

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.570
saying that's more likely because it

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.210
wasn't really that they're saying that

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.809
algorithms are somehow from the bias of

00:26:19.809 --> 00:26:22.690
the people putting them out against

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.090
AAA and they report them what flag them

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.740
more because they were like according

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.730
the null hypothesis

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.380
be no difference if anything they say

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.120
the difference that should be is that

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.010
white people get reported more because

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.290
white people are racist so if any

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.420
cording to the researchers Cornell

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.460
saying that white people should be sorry

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.690
I've seems like I emailed me back he did

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.300
not the researcher email me once so

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.230
they're like white people should be

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.490
getting reported more what happened was

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.830
black people get reported more but then

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.720
they had the n-word debacle or they're

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.220
like oh [ __ ] we forgot they can use the

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.600
n-word so that [ __ ] up a whole thing of

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.280
our data suddenly had to like go back

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.340
and do that but then they did sexism and

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.960
sexism came up like two times more

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.180
likely and they're like these [ __ ]

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.610
algorithms are clearly racist and the

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.250
argument is like well maybe with the

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.050
cultural licensing obviously you know

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.670
white people could say the n-word who

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:12.550
cares yeah but if you maybe some of that

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.650
cultural licensing creeps into the areas

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:16.270
of maybe sexism and all that other stuff

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.940
too where it's like save and I want my

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.250
[ __ ] tea at home blah blah that was the

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:23.380
word big man they were like they found

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.540
that a AE were more likely to use the

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.860
terminology [ __ ] so but they they were

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.570
like this is clearly like people need to

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.910
recognize that these these like machine

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.500
learning algorithms can't we can't have

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.630
like damn the legacy of racist coded

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.480
into the [ __ ] zeros and ones yeah

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.280
like when the robots take over they're

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.470
gonna have a a terminology well no

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.020
they're like what's up ho [ __ ] robots

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.510
matrix robots are gonna be talking like

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.950
black Twitter well they're saying right

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.090
now they're not right now they're gonna

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:53.110
be knock that off

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:55.030
yeah no bro bots are white right not

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.520
gonna be embedded in there they're gonna

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.020
have to fix it yeah the robots take over

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.420
it's gonna be pure a man dude they're

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.890
gonna go sit one all that when they all

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.360
switch off for the [ __ ] motherboard

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:16.570
there's yeah there so the I want the guy

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.790
to uh I want the guy to get back to me

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:19.780
cuz I'm like I just want to make sure I

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.920
have this right cuz it's all it's all

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.260
getting a damn you didn't get back to me

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.820
it's all getting big of course there's

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.990
like you know they took it already in

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:27.880
the news they were liked by people more

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.290
races we have proof now and it's like

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:30.790
well there's like it also could be the

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.380
sample itself could have just been

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.750
skewed somehow with more black people

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.730
but it does bring up interesting

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:40.150
questions where it's like now you're

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:41.170
doing this is hard

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.150
um who's getting reported by an

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.130
algorithm I don't know I would say their

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.530
twitter has put some time and effort

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.990
into this [ __ ] you know what I mean

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.590
so the sexism one's weird where there

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.060
like some reason black people came up as

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.220
twice twice as many times being reported

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.330
for being sexist

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.180
and it's clearly like a you know someone

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.950
[ __ ] up the coding of these of these

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.260
training these classifiers I mean it

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.880
sounds like the only way you're gonna be

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.320
able to do this is to just let everybody

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.480
say whatever exactly and that's the

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.490
thing too is like to think that we can

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:14.290
have a [ __ ] machine like sift through

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:16.300
the nuances is like let people's brains

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.460
can do this automatically read it I'll

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.840
say the n-word and make always a black

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.520
guy okay I have no need to worry but

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.080
they have witters like ping ping ping

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.750
Bing bong big n-word Walt the Wakanda

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.370
n-word wall dude is on Twitter and dude

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:37.270
someone busted through [ __ ] oh yeah man

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.700
that was that study was like I was up

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.960
all night last night reading about that

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.130
like dude this is [ __ ] crazy

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.770
in between crushing oh then it yeah then

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.210
the [ __ ] everyone how'd you do in the

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.820
Clarins last night bro I didn't lose man

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.040
you'll have right now I'm sitting pretty

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.900
in my attack my defenses are my my

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.670
attacks my offense is way better my

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.530
defense takes so much time to arrange

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.600
everything perfect like big 12 football

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.000
yeah my offense bro off it's great I'm

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.880
getting 100% destruction on people

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.900
really yeah you're just destroying

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.000
people's entire village i skipped if i

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.500
seem real hard looking the villagers I'm

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.270
like no no and I see one with life I see

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.090
I see I see stone walls do all dude I

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.130
destroy them it was funny too because I

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.870
was like I had all these new things

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.820
unlocked I'd researched all they had

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.380
leveled all my guys up and if for a

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.790
second I was in bed last night and I was

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.740
like I just was about to just roll

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.300
through a town I'm like dude this is how

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.250
Rome must have felt it when that room

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:28.600
was just like yeah we were other we have

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.970
the best one going against like some

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.190
shitty [ __ ] tribe yeah what [ __ ]

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.960
these guys yeah and I would decide to

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.550
sit there and watch into Hunter but you

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.860
watch like your plan unfold perfectly

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.420
and you're like oh my god dude I'm the

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.490
best here's 20 more dollars somehow I

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:46.090
need I need better boss so while you're

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:48.220
gone someone can attack you yeah [ __ ]

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.930
so you just log back on your shits just

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.150
ruined and some days like oh no or be

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:53.350
been raided and you'll see whether or

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.850
not your defenses stood up

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.860
they get 50% destruction or destroy your

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.020
townhall you lose but if you hold them

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.240
to like 49% and retain your town wall

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.340
Town Hall so there's nothing you can do

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.370
while you're on defense you can just as

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.590
geniusly engineer your village against

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:12.720
invaders barbarians is everyone wait

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.400
everyone that invades is a barbarian oh

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.140
so when you're on offense you're a

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.750
barbarian for sure oh I'm gonna know I'm

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.140
an invasive force yeah yeah my were like

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.360
purely a fascist you're expanding your

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.990
empire yeah I'm very true just kind of

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.160
am actually I'm not really I have no

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.780
rhyme or reason I'm a smashing people

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.230
and taking it

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.090
that's only I pretty much only upgrade

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.520
my troops I just get Maya doesn't get

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.290
them because you support them exactly

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.550
love I love the troops

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.080
I love the skeletons with [ __ ] bombs

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.970
and I love this really moms

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.600
yeah if skeletons deposit Ragan's this

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.100
guy there's a guy that literally carries

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.950
a bombing in the wall love him he's the

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.820
guy all right P he's dizzy of a name

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.160
it's the name names of some of the

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.630
troops I literally just like Archer

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.340
Queen bomber skeleton is pretty

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.660
straightforward nice yeah

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.750
that's cuz it's got to be universal DX

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:11.980
well where for dude wow the new war will

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.660
be fought out on clash clans do you

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:19.660
think dude did you have fun on Thursday

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.940
night yo man that was a blast

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.680
that was fun that was so [ __ ] fun

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.680
sold out hair spring comedies Wow damn

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.510
Wow I was a blast year yeah it was

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.070
really fun dude I didn't wouldn't get to

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.720
talk about the night before or the two

Gaiety wild that comes at students but

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.270
we were talking about with a [ __ ]

00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:59.770
Twitter algorithm and Netflix had to

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:03.340
approve it yes a Netflix was like well

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.990

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.000
that's gonna be big Netflix big uproar a

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
lot of money so maybe money's more

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.470
important than social justice to some of

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:18.130
these companies

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:21.070
how did Netflix yeah yeah I mean dude oh

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.900
it's also it's he was the perfect person

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.760
to do that well you came out swinging

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.310
and drop that you his video berry dude

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.590
you just sunk into the sand like Jafar

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:36.130
dude yeah Jaguar head would have

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:40.750
swallowed you up yeah dude you got you

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:45.010
taking the reigns powered Dave's bail

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:46.900
just embolden hate speech [ __ ] yet it

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.390
I'm happy yeah the dude that's what I'm

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:51.730
talking about though he's that you're

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:54.640
maybe just maybe it's a null hypothesis

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.210
just maybe he has I mean I think I've

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:00.400
made up the term cultural licensing

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.839
he is allowed to say all that [ __ ] yeah

00:42:01.839 --> 00:42:03.490
of course so it's like you don't think

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.049
that that and that the whole country's

00:42:05.049 --> 00:42:06.730
like ah hilarious you don't think that

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.170
transmits on a Twitter and chickens they

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:09.490
were like why are all these guys getting

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:11.890
pinched for by our algorithms we set up

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:14.799
to protect protected classes why are

00:42:14.799 --> 00:42:16.240
they why are they turning and doing all

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.920
the stuff and it's like I don't know

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.079
it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna need

00:42:20.079 --> 00:42:21.609
some very deep research and hopefully

00:42:21.609 --> 00:42:23.500
not from 25 year old Gender Studies

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.049
students yes who's like manning this

00:42:26.049 --> 00:42:28.630
research how the [ __ ] they're worried I

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.220
would watch the with mission I would

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.690
watch the gender specific terminology

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:33.760
use gender studies know like Manning

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.829
this operation sorry please sorry please

00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:37.569
control that me somebody we need someone

00:42:37.569 --> 00:42:43.000
to transduce operation we a few good

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.650
trans stepfather but dude it's like why

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.880
you're talking like machine learning

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.200
like they're talking I'll you know like

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.880
we repurposed some informational

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.470
qualifiers it's like okay you just

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:58.779
talking machine learning and whoo but

00:42:58.779 --> 00:43:00.789
[ __ ] Thelma from scooby-doo is like I

00:43:00.789 --> 00:43:01.440
got this

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.079
hold up no that's not racist obviously

00:43:05.079 --> 00:43:07.299
racist wait black people can't be I'm in

00:43:07.299 --> 00:43:08.380
a school where they say black people

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.119
can't be racist so like that the whole

00:43:10.119 --> 00:43:12.220
thing of so like okay so you take out

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.349
racism do the power dynamic now can

00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:15.760
black people commit acts of abusive

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.940
speech online well you have to look at

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.470
the context and obviously it is you have

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:27.309
to look at their avatars Goku they can

00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:30.819
say the n-word it's also it also could

00:43:30.819 --> 00:43:31.839
have been the fact that there was just

00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:34.150
you know a bad sample but there but

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:35.890
that's what I hate the Cystic [ __ ] they

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:37.990
could've just had a weirdly lopsided

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.420
sample full of more black people could

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.069
be the weird culture like if a lot of

00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:43.059
it's coming up around use of the n-word

00:43:43.059 --> 00:43:44.230
is like what other is there any other

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:46.420
words maybe you're being used God freely

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.029
you know engine studying that oh my god

00:43:49.029 --> 00:43:51.579
we cracked the case machine learnings

00:43:51.579 --> 00:43:54.130
racist we did it thank you oh my god

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:55.480
even the things about studies that's

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.609
annoying is that like in the conclusions

00:43:57.609 --> 00:43:59.079
they there's a last paragraph that they

00:43:59.079 --> 00:44:01.270
say like well here's what here's what

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:03.039
also could explain the fact that we

00:44:03.039 --> 00:44:04.690
rejected the null hypothesis meaning

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:07.150
that we like our hypothesis is true or

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:08.770
it was you know all and all you need to

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.380
is like a point low one or a point oh

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.000
five oh five and statistically

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.260
significant so it's like a math

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.930
so we cannot make sense logically but if

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:18.640
you get that point I won that's

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.380
statistically significant as long as you

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.700
acknowledge in the end like well it

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.350
could have also been these things you

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.119
publish at the newspapers read the title

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:26.980
and go holy [ __ ] dude machine that

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.480
machine learnings racist and dude that's

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.060
like 80% of our new I would say 95%

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:34.109
number news on science are misleaded

00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:36.880
studies or studies that are just misread

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:38.260
by people who don't understand them and

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.480
go like oh this is what happened then

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.470
other people like no here's what

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.330
happened it's [ __ ] ridiculous

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:45.490

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:12.480
a classic murder case pick one who has

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.430
reason to protect you think oh I've

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:17.160
fired an employee last week make a

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.599
murder case it's always just at a party

00:50:18.599 --> 00:50:20.460
in a high school kid dude if they did

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:22.410
CSI just upper Decker's that'd be the

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:28.800
best [ __ ] yes I think we're on yeah

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.599
let's go but yet upper Decker's is two

00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:36.150
people still do him they have to it's

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:38.970
the funny suit I've worked with people

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:40.410
who have legitimately told me stories

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:41.940
that end it with them up or decking

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.440
someone who serves them right

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.339
serves them right dude what you [ __ ] in

00:50:47.339 --> 00:50:49.470
the top of the toilet how does that

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:52.730
translate Judy so [ __ ] it

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:55.460
you [ __ ] up or dagger SS very it's a

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.740
big contract this is like a move to

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:03.849
actually like stand actual act itself is

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:06.890
when whoever opens the tank it looks at

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:08.029
they have to piece all that together

00:51:08.029 --> 00:51:15.380
like someone stood here also gonna sit

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.329
and think about oh yeah and you could

00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:20.539
get an alarm flush after you wipe you

00:51:20.539 --> 00:51:22.519
could still flush nobody is hurt or a

00:51:22.519 --> 00:51:25.130
down the turtle he made a third stays if

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:27.470
it's in a good upper deck so people who

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:29.119
attend upper decks tend to have

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:33.650
humongous turds there's not a basket of

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:34.730
shrimp you're talking about

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:58.640
I guess does it only this could be solve

00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.990
you get an alarm on the top of your

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.160
toilet so if someone lives you're

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:10.819
talking car alarm the alarms going off

00:52:10.819 --> 00:52:18.289
it's like a bank robbery gone bad stains

00:52:18.289 --> 00:52:20.950
are puddles that's what he was about

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:25.039
broken the upper deck yeah I talked to

00:52:25.039 --> 00:52:26.630
guys who defended on being like he's a

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:28.039
[ __ ] [ __ ] video me money you know

00:52:28.039 --> 00:52:33.440
protect them I didn't think about the

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.880
turd I don't think the turkey is I need

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.819
to turn remains the water it's hooked

00:52:37.819 --> 00:52:39.799
into that even if they turn the turns

00:52:39.799 --> 00:52:41.809
like fun breaks they turd

00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:43.910
cuz it yeah but the whole the toilet

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:46.460
holes kind of clogged like the things

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:47.930

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:49.519
diameter that little water holes maybe

00:52:49.519 --> 00:52:50.869
an inch or two so you're gonna have to a

00:52:50.869 --> 00:52:53.450
turd fold and break and then squeeze

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:56.630

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:59.089
follow the same I guess it's just

00:52:59.089 --> 00:53:02.329
physics at that point they [ __ ] break

00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:05.310
they leave little smears on the core

00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:08.610
