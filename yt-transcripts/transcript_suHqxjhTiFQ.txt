black guys and it's like we would

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.630

[ __ ] MIDI and then she's not gonna

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.200
start on that vein I literally I was my

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.670
fault I thought you said that I was like

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.110
what yeah I didn't say anything about

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.000
vodkas no you didn't spike History Month

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.099
I know I made a way of my bed I made it

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.050
weird

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.260
dude so yeah opening its Black History

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.900
Month yeah can't be saying [ __ ] like

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.430
that I didn't say anything I see you got

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.600
your hoodie on yeah I do

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.400
that's nice yeah I'm wearing a hoodie -

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.620
hell yeah but what you trying to say

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.250
it's nice we're solidarity that's Joe we

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.970
are this is looking sick yeah pretty hot

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.390
cast so far I was pretty derailed in

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.240
harshly racist no heaven I've said I did

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.770
about that he's literally thought that

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.530
you said bin Diego Simeone Saudis were a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.380
minute us and then we're already racist

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.720
damn dude look at that guy what's he up

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.900
to

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.030
I don't see him oh nice a white [ __ ]

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.710
one more studio neighborhood that's

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.420
funny surprising and he looks like a

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.040
podcaster actually he actually probably

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.580
listens

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.650
he's got a [ __ ] sweater turtleneck on

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.230
and a party snowed did a cool snow hat

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.520
with did he ever get cool snow hat with

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.770
a hat brim what a an it Billy

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.260
what I'm [ __ ] weird illy yeah I think

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.280
that's what they're called knit Billy's

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.780
the people who well that's where in the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.550
Hat brim snow huh it's called a [ __ ]

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.890
NIC Billy I'm fairly certain that makes

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.590
even worse such a weird neighborhood

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.020
it's weird to live in an inner-city

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.950
neighborhood because you have black

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.070
people and white [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah so

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.459
really no one to like Jesus did for

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.320
three minutes and Alicia's capitulated

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.070
deleted hey we're back after

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.230
experiencing technical difficulties yeah

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.140
we debated whether or not I should

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.930
delete that but I feel like you guys

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.010
probably have a decent enough sense of

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.709
humor to know that I was kidding

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.040
yeah exactly yeah so we're gonna just

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.950
move forward a bit it's a funny joke is

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.840
funny it's a funny thing to say it is

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.580
funny the reason it's funny is because

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.810
it's not true

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.080
exactly you know exactly it's just a

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.200
funny thing to say any we're not you

but yeah a black lady [ __ ] shoutout

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.139
is the best feeling oh dude okay baby I

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.930
had two black ladies at a the show I did

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.639
on Saturday and they were they were they

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.380
were loving it loving it did and I hit

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.210
him with some hard hitting with the

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.470
realness dude I was hitting them with

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.330
some white racism but you know what here

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.740
I'm gonna say that so I'm gonna cut you

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.410
off I think they appreciate white people

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.020
being honest yeah in a [ __ ] when we

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.360
live in a time where white people are

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.360
super [ __ ] a afraid to be racist yeah

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.979
rightfully so you shouldn't you

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.810
shouldn't be but you shouldn't be honest

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.530
with how you feel yes and of course I

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.210
think they at least people that come to

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.650
comedy shows that I'm on they tend to

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.650
appreciate just like yeah I think [ __ ]

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.810
up thoughts yeah it's any I don't mean

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.060
it but in your head you think [ __ ] up

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.560
things and they can [ __ ] agree with

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.970
that instead of just white [ __ ] going

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.280
up there and be like it's disgusting

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.590
what's going on right now dude whoa okay

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.320
to be fair yeah exactly so and it's like

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.310
it's also funny like black people know

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.349
that white people think [ __ ] up [ __ ]

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.449
constantly cuz they [ __ ] up Shay of

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.300
course like I'll say seven out of ten

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.370
black people you find and I'm wildly

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.500
ballparking but if you were to be like

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.190
do like an agent if your names like it

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.110
here goes is hot too if you're in a car

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.550
saying I haven't out at an upfront

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.169
really set you up for failure

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.630
no I still stand by this if you're okay

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.849

them be like dude Asians are the [ __ ]

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.180

ten black people like I'll do I know

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.400

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.190
oh seven so you have to hook the white

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.770

sin at nine yeah yeah so that's my

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.740
that's my two cents but it's also to

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.060

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.930
it ethic dude this sucks few to be

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.540
anything to tea but yes Kepler was a

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.460
Catholic to the t45 [ __ ] worm eight

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.120
years of my life

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.890
so you didn't jerk off I did and I would

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.960
apologize and I'd [ __ ] be feel bad

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.530
about it

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.480
yeah tries to make deals all right all

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.600
right sorry no I don't know how to tu or

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.870
Catholic I [ __ ] confessed what's it

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.580
say in the Bible about torturing animals

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.070
I don't know there's probably some [ __ ]

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.600
in the Old Testament [ __ ] animals up

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.460
when he calls for it definitely it's

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.830
like when the ox rears its hooves chop

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.870
its [ __ ] head off yeah that's a good

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.670
move yeah what about what do you think

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.470
it says in the Bible about drowning mice

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.270
in Cherry Coke

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.910
if you drowned two mice you enter the

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.130
kingdom through a needle yeah well I

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.760
mean yeah that's [ __ ] mercy that is

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.790
mercy oh but so by the way drowning them

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.380
I think it was probably the harshest

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.930
thing oh it may have been some dude told

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.640
me at the dog park drownings peaceful so

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.450
therefore it's true but yeah so they

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.820
turned on [ __ ] Bill Maher and I don't

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.390
know dude

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.390
I don't feel like like what the [ __ ] was

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.670
like he gives a [ __ ] he's like yeah yeah

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.650
he's a [ __ ] globalist show but anyway

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.350
he is a clueless dude it's so [ __ ]

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.630
funny though just like if that were me

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.760
out of it so me to him that's like no

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.990
you what ended you have been like

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.070
looking at the camera like at the

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.510
teleprompter I don't know what to say

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.000
yeah and my [ __ ] pen rush them and

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.650
they all dude just destroyed and they

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.030
were having like a little bender he was

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.280
actually but I don't typically like Bill

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.990
Moore and that was kind of funny when he

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.490
was [ __ ] with them yeah yeah oh man

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.860
[ __ ] don't Mars I actually kind of

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.570
started to like him a little which is

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.270
perfect although I know exactly which is

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.850
funny but the I also realized I don't

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.070
like open dialogues people like we need

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.480

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.370

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.760
willfully disagree but you know and I

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.050

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.310

on like there's the thing saying like

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.860
Russia definitely interfere to the

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.450

[Laughter]

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.600

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:42.980
got

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.890
what about Sandy Hook I don't know I

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.029
wasn't there you know I can't

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:49.970
substantiate anything but the dude I had

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.500
a theory though am i lo I have a

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.020
conspiracy oh my lo go ahead I feel like

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.830
he's so he's doing an ultimate

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.170
sacrificial troll so he's a gay dude no

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.029
doubt but I think he's trying to appeal

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:03.440
to the hearts of people who typically

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.060
don't like the gay like the middle of

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.709
the country don't like the gay the gay

00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:08.540
Damon

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.830
it's all I've been middle of the country

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.820
yeah like super conservative

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:11.990
specifically don't like gay people

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.390
Milo's taking all the stuff they love me

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.640
like I'm gay and he just put himself up

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.950
on a cross for it just to [ __ ] I've

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.930
given my little way too much credit ya

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:24.230
know he's just a brat he's an idiot I

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.300
mean it is entertaining to watch him go

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.670
to a college campus talk [ __ ] but even

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.350
seeing him on when he's like interview

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.600
and he's like yeah he's terrible and he

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.790
says he's in that Bill Maher thing he

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.730
said something about like transsexuals

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.810
were at a disproportionate rate for

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.790
sexual crimes and titties really he says

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.110
a lot of weird transgendered yeah we

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.720
won't hire gay people because yeah I

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.760
think that was a joke Tim very funny

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.860
joke save a [ __ ] Ralph you'll like

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.120
would you hire gay people he's like now

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.620
they're always late they're on drugs and

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.720
they're [ __ ] up that's a funny thing

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.579
that is funny but I still that's my

00:13:01.579 --> 00:13:04.190
theory right now that's yes get Middle

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.630
America to [ __ ] warm up to gay people

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.320
what's your theory on the moon landing I

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.760

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.190
holy Dale I like that one I like NASA

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.780

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.120
[ __ ] Hillary you think that was

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.070
Hillary that our seven Taylor you built

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.270

document was push down boxes snowing

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.860

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.390
like the rigged up walkie-talkie it was

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.730
