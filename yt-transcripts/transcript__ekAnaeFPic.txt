there's a very

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.120
solid argument to be like

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.759
[ __ ] content the uh

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.919

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.479
nah you don't got to do that dude he's

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.600
like nah it'll be funny like i'll just

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.919
say it was me

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.840
and this this is where this is where i

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.600
feel guilty because i was just like this

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.880
is the thing i'm working on right now

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.080
i'm not uh

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.320
because i'll just like out in my head

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.840
it's like now that's a bad idea but like

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.560

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.840
who cares yeah

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.680
so that's my bad this is this is the

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.199
genesis of this whole situation could

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.800
have been averted by me being like yeah

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.720
no bro seriously don't do that

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.160
so when i figured oh my god maybe this

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.360
guy does computer stuff he's kind of

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.240
savvy like that

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.240
he just used his own handle and went out

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.680
and said this so immediately they pulled

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.880
up all the [ __ ]

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.319
so i i didn't know he just texted me the

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.000
next day being like dude i'm getting

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.600
docs i'm getting docs put me in the

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.199
reddit so i can like ban people who are

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.199
doxxing me and i'm like oh yeah dude

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.639
meanwhile i'm working i'm at home i'm

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.160
sitting there like this yes i'm like

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.600
yeah man do whatever you got to do

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.720
and you know where i'm like having to

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.319
laugh with him i'm like this is [ __ ]

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.680
so funny i'm just you know sitting there

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.960
doing my thing

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.000
and then i start getting a bunch of

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.919
messages people like he's out of control

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.039
he's out of control

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:20.720
we didn't dox him all he did is we went

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.479
on his youtube thing and his name was

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.000
apparently his name was in his public

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.520
profile on youtube so it wasn't

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.960
really a docs although people were

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.880
sharing his name because the name was

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.039
already accessible so he misrepresented

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.520
the docs

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.520
your digital assistant gave you false

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.039
information about a docs

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.720

laughing at my computer saying like dude

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.400
people are like we're getting banned

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.000

chat uh

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.680
and i i by the time i had looked at it

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.199
billy had already done all this stuff

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:12.400
and done all this [ __ ]

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.360
but the uh so what happened billy had

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.080
come in and

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.080
swung the sword billy calm and swung the

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.759
sword you know ran a little [ __ ]

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.280
banner real quick

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.639
dropped up a little billboard and did

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:25.039
his thing but yeah he got

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:28.080
he now now as a conspiracy theorist

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.840
myself

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.560
yeah usually what i do is i see who

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.680
benefited from what happened

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.639
sure who did the crisis anyway anyway

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.479
neither here nor there

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:43.759
that's neither here nor there so so then

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:45.280
all right so then i like you know

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.199
oh it all started with you know just me

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:48.879
taking a dump and being like

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:50.639

reddit dms and uh that

00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:36.719
bothered me immensely when it's

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:39.039
something you know and then he did lay

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.479
he was like here's the california laws

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:41.680

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.040
couple couple months

but as i learned through that experience

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.040
there's literally nothing you can do and

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.080
it didn't matter

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.959

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:06.720

that's an embarrassing one floating

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:20.399
around

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:22.560
uh but yeah then yeah of course well

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.839
here's something

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:27.120
unknown user was in if he's on trial

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.959

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:30.399
[ __ ] don't [ __ ]

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:32.080
don't give me career advice while i'm

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.920
literally going through the snl thing

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.440
that was crazy dude

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.600
yeah that was nuts well this was so this

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.959
was the uh

00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:40.240
so this is what happened so then i'm

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.360
sitting there and i get all these

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.279
messages apparently people just started

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:46.080
[ __ ] crushing this dude crushing like

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.800

they absolutely annihilated this dude

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.240
so then i'm seeing this i'm like man

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.839
[ __ ] i shouldn't have told him to do

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:56.560
that

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.399
you know he he did he was guilty of the

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:00.240
crime of you know almost kind of

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.760
misrepresenting the docs and then

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.240
getting

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.880
banning everybody but you know so that

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.320
happens but then i'm like well

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.760
you know i'm not going to sit here and

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.200
i'm not going to like hang this dude out

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.480
to dry for the sake of

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.480
you know people being like i pay you i'm

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.320
a fan you're me to be loyal to me

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.880
it's like yeah man i hear you but like i

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.079
will say this matt

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:21.120
cause privately matt

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.680
matt knew what the [ __ ] was up i'm just

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.160
talking

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.680
let me talk to the fans dude let me

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.440
break it down matt knew what the [ __ ]

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:27.920
was up

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.440
he's just a nice enough dude that he

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.320
wasn't gonna smash the digital assistant

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.839
because he knew he was strong enough to

00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:36.000
take on the digital assistant's sins

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.920
he knew it you had to had to and they

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.839
were my sins dude they were my sins

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.600
in in retrospect this is something you

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.959
know you have to be present at all times

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:44.160
in your life otherwise you just let

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.000
things [ __ ] enter it that can cause

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.560
you chaos but you got evil hippies in

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.600
they get in and they get caught

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.920
so yeah it was like in my head i was

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.720
like [ __ ] this

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.399
i'm not going to bend to the mob never

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:57.760
been to the mob dude don't you know

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.320
never been

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.399
to the sjw mob i'm not going to bend to

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:01.760
this mob either you know i'm just i'm

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.920
not going to do it but here's my sins

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.839
and now that's the explanation

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:08.880
the sins were going on and

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.399
throwing spells under the bus that's my

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.920
bad swells as a man

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.360
ready i should have talked to radio dogs

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.120
swells is the man i love dude

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.200
swells is a great dude we obviously we

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.320
love him

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.079
it's not wrong to make fun of him for

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:22.399
saying you went over his head

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:26.399
yes that was hilarious very negligible

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:27.839
you're innocent to make one of them for

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:31.120
that true but again it's like my

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.279
the thing that i i didn't want to i just

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:34.720
like i can't

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.959

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:38.000
i you know

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.279
i do this thing that i think is going to

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.560
be funny and it ends up with everyone

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.000
pulling up all of my videos ever

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.360

like

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.440
you know the umbilical cord is wrapped

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.240
around you what

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.360
gross so check this is this is where

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.480
so if people want to understand my

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.399
mindset here's where i'm coming from so

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:12.000
you know this was five months ago i'm

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.680
like i'm sitting there you know they

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.120
they wrapped the umbilical cord away

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.480
from my daughter's neck that was slowing

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.600
down her heart rate during all the

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.560
contractions

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.320
and brittany's like like passed out on a

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.320
[ __ ] table and then they just go from

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.920
behind the curtain presenting me with a

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.279
human being that i'm like

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:27.680
whoa so i'm like you know now i just

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.800
have a human being

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.160
so that's like something now i'm you

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.839
know you get your baby back on her feet

00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:33.600
so five months later i'm sitting at a

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.040
computer and all people are messaging me

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.680
being like

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.000
i'm kicked out of the subreddit and my

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.680
brain is i swear to god my brain just

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.800

00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:46.560
and that was that's where my cavalier

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.839
attitude came from i wasn't trying to

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:49.040

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.800

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.760
well that's the case that's the that's

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.800
the whole subreddit

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.560
if it's on everybody else it's fine as

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.839
soon as it hits you

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:23.680

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.320
bunch of sensitive [ __ ] that want to

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.920
make fun of everyone else and not get

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.199
made fun of y'all

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:33.120
i was legitimate i started seeing this

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.399
stuff pop up and i was just like

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:35.199
literally

00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:36.320
and it's so funny because it's like

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.360
matt's a [ __ ] and i'm like

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.839
[ __ ] [ __ ] dude

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:44.399
it's worse and i i called matt while we

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:45.759
were while i was driving back from

00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:46.959
philly and i was just like

00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:49.279
dude if i tried to explain what i

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:50.399
because i was stressed about

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:53.199
like this made me stressed yeah like i

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:56.000
was like man [ __ ] this

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.600
and then i tried to explain like if you

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.519
had to explain it to just an adult

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:01.839
like another person like they'd be like

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:03.279
oh man you seem kind of

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:06.480
stressed out what's wrong it's like well

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.160
i'm getting caught a [ __ ] on this

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.639
website

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.680
so so yeah that was that was a state of

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.720
thing so that was my

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.240
my crimes in my eyes are uh

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.000
not being president enough and dictating

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.079
what should have went on that's my bad i

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:23.839
fully manifested the situation out of

00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:24.720
passivity

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.600
so that's my bad the other thing was and

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.320
then

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.600
being like you know and i wasn't i was

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.720
in a double doozy i'm like i'm not

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.000
throwing this dude under the bus

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.079
i could've just been like hey guys sorry

00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:35.519

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.360
[ __ ] on our episode i nego [ __ ] on a

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.560
bunch of people

and you know yeah that was it that that

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:45.360
there are the crimes dude

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.600
it's very contagious dude if you get bit

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.519
by one you instantly become one

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:52.560
at least for 12 hours

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:54.320
i'll tell you who i'll tell you who took

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.920

dude he got called a [ __ ]

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.720
but yeah so that was um that was pretty

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.720
much it man i can't think of a

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.240
that was basically the story it was

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.000
legitimately being confused that being

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.480
like

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.319
wait are these guys like seriously upset

or they [ __ ] around like i can't

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:27.120
really tell and then people were

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.440
honestly like you're just loyal to the

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.960
fan and it's like

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.480

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.799
want some dude to like freak out

00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:36.480

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.559
a lot of people

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:28.000
apparently well if we reward people for

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
saying that you're guilty and gay

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.679

point of this

00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:37.360
it would be true i think bill c

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.559

and like within the past week or two

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.640
they've entered

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.640
the subreddit hard like i went to

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.159
shane's show in cleveland

00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:55.600

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.840

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:03.200
yeah it hurts it hurts your feelings

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.039
right i mean

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:06.559
it wasn't hurting my feelings but then

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:07.919
like you start attacking my girl and

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:09.600
then she doesn't have his thick skin so

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.559
i was like

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:11.840
because he wasn't getting to me so he

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.159
was going after her that's a noel bro

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:15.919
i'll say that right now right right

00:32:15.919 --> 00:32:18.960
big time oh well yeah

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.840
reddit the reddit will go for your ols

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.760
as hard as they can

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.600
that's why i just shush highest they can

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.440
go for it i don't stand for that

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.440
i don't stand for that no it is junk

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.200
yeah you can't attack the base dude they

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.240
don't have the wherewithal on the

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.840
internet to get a full force of a reddit

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.200
thing dude

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.720
because it's it's weird it's cheap and

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.880
it's wicked but uh

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.519
my overall opinion on it is i came i

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:42.880
just woke up and

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.320
all the [ __ ] was about jake

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.440
banning everybody and uh

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.720
i didn't get banned so but i think he

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.919
was pretty gay

00:32:53.919 --> 00:32:55.519
that he had that he lied to you about

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:57.200
the doc because nobody was doxing him

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.799
that i saw like they were just releasing

00:32:58.799 --> 00:33:00.240
his like they were posting his videos

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.120
and [ __ ]

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.159
but nobody was doxing and uh so he gave

00:33:04.159 --> 00:33:06.000
you false information to get that power

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.360
which

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.240
it's pretty gay but we're sick we're

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.799
pretty sick

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.880
i hear you i hear you i stand with you

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.640
guys the cash rules

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.640
you both rule oh yeah so i thought i

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.720
i think you were being a little gay

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.000
because by taking his side

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.200
efforts but overall

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.279
you're in the right whatever imagine if

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:30.720
you were my digital assistant and you

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.760
went rogue dude

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.200
right i would have jumped on the same

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.440
bum and i think the whole like rainy

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.480
situation if i saw that pose i get where

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.840
he's coming from but he went about it

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.360
the wrong way like he was trying to rile

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.679
everybody up to like attack radio dogs

00:33:43.679 --> 00:33:45.200
and like strike him down and [ __ ] which

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.080
i think was going about it the wrong way

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.799
but rainey doesn't and it happens

00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:56.720
people don't know how reddit works true

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.360
also too people forget like you know i

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.559
know rainey's a little older than us

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:01.840
we're kind of geezers dude

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.600
randy's almost like 40 years old like we

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.440
used to rent from blockbuster

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.880
so it's like you see that on you're like

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.159
god damn it get this down

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.320
we're geezing the whole situation

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.599
i think this needs to be like it just

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:16.960
needs to be let go like there's people

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.560
still talking about the [ __ ] on reddit

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:18.960
like

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.599
up like an hour ago when i was on it

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:22.000
well

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.679
i mean we're we're currently talking

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.200
about it you're

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.639
right but

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:29.760
i think you should obviously put the

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.520
best i'm out of my court all right

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.560
you're out

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.879
thank you

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.960
sounds like he's very loyal he's a

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.760
loyalist

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.679
he's a loyal dog good point good points

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:48.000
get good points and that seems to be

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.359
that seems to be the case

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:50.879
i think people were salty that i went on

00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:53.040
and was like shut the [ __ ] up

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.159
you [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.160
which honestly yeah i mean whatever that

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.839
gets in the thing that the funniest part

00:35:01.839 --> 00:35:03.599
is but it's a thing i've called customer

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:05.119
consciousness where people are like

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:07.359
but i'm a customer you have to be nice

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:09.280
to me it's like

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.760
okay sure whatever but you know that's

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.640
something i think

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.640
you see and it's like i hear i hear

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.960
where they're coming from but again i

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.560
the fact that people thought they were

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.560
going to be banned from forever

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.839
that's how they're reacting like they're

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:23.200
like that's it i'm out i got banned

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.520
forever it's like dude

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.640
all right someone says they have a

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.560
controversial view

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.079
let's see i'm sure this is going to be

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.280
probably i think there's people because

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.359
some people they won't uh

00:36:23.359 --> 00:36:27.119

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.280
[Music]

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.560
a lot of people want a full frontal

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.320
tenus i don't know

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.110
no no no

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.520
[Laughter]

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.839
no good god oh my god

00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:47.280
here we go we got we got two guys we

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.720
have a couple guys coming up that should

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.040
be good

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.960
so but yeah that's pretty much the issue

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.640
man i think that's uh i think i spoke my

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.839
piece and you know

00:36:55.839 --> 00:36:58.960
look actually you know what let's uh say

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.760
these questions up

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.280
first of all someone's [ __ ] all

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.040
right here's dude this is a good one

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.040
so what do you say to dogs who allege

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.359
that all this bashing of your fans

00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:13.440
the real issue as it seems ungrateful is

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.359
the psychological projection

00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:17.440
of your own deep-seated insecurities and

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.280
belief that you're not worthy of all

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.119
these laughs and admiration and only

00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:22.800
receive them due to your proximity to

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.240
shane

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.320
there's a question dude this is this is

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.160
this is what this is a psyop

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.119
so it's like i mean dude honestly yeah i

00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:31.680
would say

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.480
the would my would people know about me

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.800
to the extent if it wasn't for shane's

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.320
notoriety probably not uh worthy of all

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.440
these laughs

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.400
thank god for that god made me this way

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.680
that's all i can really say about that

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.960
the whole thing of a psychological

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.880
projection it's like

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.680
i mean sure man you know you can get

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.800
into this

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.720
well no the trans the thing there this

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.640
is one of those questions like you know

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.240
like man i got them now but it's you

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.839
know possibly but

00:37:59.839 --> 00:38:01.839
you try to if you try to think about

00:38:01.839 --> 00:38:03.040
someone else's projection you're

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.240
typically mind reading

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.760
which is you know kind of a foul scene

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.079
of itself but it could be dude it could

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:08.720
be

dude

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.760
that's nudity dude dumb [ __ ] that's why

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.200
i called him gay dude because he does

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.040
his stuff he's not ready to run your

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.559
reddit he's not ready to run anything oh

00:50:56.559 --> 00:50:57.520
look at it well

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.520
that's childish right there i mean

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.040
you're showing ass that's pretty sick

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.800
but you know he'd try to use the dogs by

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.240
showing cheeks yeah he showed some ass

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.079
oh yeah he that was a golden cat

00:51:06.079 --> 00:51:07.760
tactic that i won't [ __ ] stand for

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.839
that's kind of [ __ ]

00:51:09.839 --> 00:51:13.280
look at a girl's hand it was a nice dude

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.800
honestly

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.160
when you when you gotta hold that deep

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.599
the only way out of that it's a fat ass

00:51:17.599 --> 00:51:19.040
dude i mean honestly it's

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.640
from a tactical perspective showing some

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.040
fat ass is pretty safe

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:26.400
bill what now as a conspiracy theorist

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.440
like myself

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.720
would you say normally when like in a tr

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.160
like a horrible tragedy like this

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:32.640
happens

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.720
yeah and then you think to yourself who

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.319
gained the most

00:51:36.319 --> 00:51:39.280
that's usually who's behind it yeah who

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.079
do you think

00:51:40.079 --> 00:51:43.440

if you remember if you're not a member

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.160
of the melanation

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.160
and you're trying to talk you know in a

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.400
rhyme it's going to look bad

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.040
you know and he looked bad doing that

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.119
like real bad have you seen the videos

00:53:03.119 --> 00:53:04.400
i thought the video was sick the one

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:05.680
where he's naked i actually got him you

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.880
thought it was

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.800
i mean okay maybe that's just the

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.599
generational guy there but

00:53:11.599 --> 00:53:13.599
that's my rule on everything but uh

00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:15.599
honestly so i'm in the reddit

00:53:15.599 --> 00:53:16.800
both of the discords and everything like

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.920
that and it was kind of funny because

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.040
whenever he posted the

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.280
incriminating like uh text or whatever

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:22.640
like admitting to the crime

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.760
this is like the one day i checked

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.200
discord and all this [ __ ] happened so it

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.240
was like um

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.520
it was like right underneath it was just

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.520
me being like guys all you got to do

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:32.960
is pay one oh no there you go i'm back

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.800
guys all you got to do is pay a dollar

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.640
wait a couple months binge them and then

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.599
unsubscribe

00:53:37.599 --> 00:53:39.280
and then everyone was like seeing that

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.800
so i was like [ __ ] like the one time i

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.880
post it's just like everyone's seeing it

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.920
but um no so that's what dude i mean the

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.280
fair thing that people say

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.800
like matt's a hipper i don't i don't

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.240
even really care what people are doing i

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.119
am a thief

00:53:51.119 --> 00:53:52.880
i steal from self checkouts constantly

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:57.839
honestly but again

00:54:01.359 --> 00:54:02.720
it's not like you're going into target

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.559
and stealing from the

00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:07.280
cat like the the [ __ ] cashier's

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:07.760
pocket

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.599
you're stealing from a giant corporation

00:54:09.599 --> 00:54:11.200
now at this point

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.800
matt and shane's secret podcast has

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.800
risen to

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.280
mention absolutely monster corporation

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.119
you know small sister companies that

00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:22.720
well i do have a solution to all this i

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.040
actually

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.480
okay so essentially i pitched this but

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.559
everyone ignored me so what you gotta do

00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:35.839
delete the reddit delete the discord

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:39.040
only communicate via physical mail come

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.160
on dude

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.599
you know you're writing letters to each

00:54:41.599 --> 00:54:42.799
other i want to write letters to each

00:54:42.799 --> 00:54:44.079
other that would be super pleasant i

00:54:44.079 --> 00:54:44.559
think

00:54:44.559 --> 00:54:45.440
you know and then we don't have to deal

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.839
with any of this so writing a letter

00:54:47.839 --> 00:54:49.440
yeah physical mail will be tight or even

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.880
just like everyone puts their cell phone

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.760
numbers up

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.520
and we just call them like stop killing

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.359
i gotta open the mail every day to see a

00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:56.799
picture of someone with downs that's

00:54:56.799 --> 00:54:57.760
like look at shane

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:02.559
learning karate yeah

00:55:02.559 --> 00:55:04.400
like no i like your written form some

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.520
calligraphy just saying

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.760
another another really funny thing is

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.160
and and the nego [ __ ] will react to this

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.599
if they're if they're being harsh and

00:55:13.599 --> 00:55:15.440
turning on us very hardly

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.599
very intensely if you click their

00:55:17.599 --> 00:55:19.599
username and look at their old comments

00:55:19.599 --> 00:55:21.920

sit in my car with the ac off for a

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.319
while and it kind of you know fixes

00:56:18.319 --> 00:56:19.119
everything

everybody who comes in though just

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.559

00:56:34.319 --> 00:56:35.680

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.319
analyzing

00:56:59.839 --> 00:57:01.520

it is ultimately my fault dude as a man

00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.880

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.319

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:16.720

you have to be president every single

00:58:18.559 --> 00:58:19.920
every single second of the day dude if

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.119
you're not paying attention what's going

00:58:21.119 --> 00:58:22.240

that's on you that's my thing i'll take

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.920
his order fulfillment job like i was

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.400

i think we we can't hire we need to just

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.200
figure it out we can't hire because you

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.240
could be the next chick

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.079
dude that's true that's true everyone

00:58:38.079 --> 00:58:39.280

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.200
split second so like you know i again

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.640
could kind of feel for him because it's

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:43.280
like

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.119
you know being put out in the spotlight

00:58:45.119 --> 00:58:46.319
and you know having all these people

00:58:46.319 --> 00:58:47.680
turn against you like i can't

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:50.160
understand how that would suck but he

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.599
did put himself out there in a pretty

00:58:51.599 --> 00:58:52.880
bad way by rapping

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.680
so it's like again kind of deserved was

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.000
it

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.480
well yeah wasn't in a position to take a

00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.280
uh

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.119
a hit like that i thought he was gonna

00:59:01.119 --> 00:59:02.319
be way more covert

00:59:02.319 --> 00:59:05.280
way more hidden that was uh that was

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.480
like when i used to prank call people

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.040

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.319
free episode because it feels bad paying

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:25.839
10 dollars to hear about how good i am

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:28.960

bridge guys i'm just ready to move on

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.600
i'm the leader i think at this point

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.960
i think at this point the reddit's just

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.799
[ __ ] um

01:08:36.799 --> 01:08:39.359
now listen bill's that bill's a boss

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:40.960
bill's the true leader

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.440
listen i want to talk about these uh war

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.520
mode patreon numbers post this issue

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.799
dude that's what i want to know because

01:08:46.799 --> 01:08:47.120
i

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.839
well if i had to guess if i had to guess

01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:53.839
yeah you know what ours went down quite

01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:54.480
a bit and

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.400
it seems like bills went up quite a bit

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.000
which is nice it's almost like

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.400
how'd that go right and you handled it

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:07.839
wrong wow

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.920
did i say i'm going to do this for a war

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.679
mode or matt and shane's

01:09:15.679 --> 01:09:17.520
you you have good intentions you had

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.679
good attention

01:09:19.679 --> 01:09:20.960
you said this is for matt and shane or

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.719
did you immediately post pictures of one

01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:23.279
code

01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:25.679
no i post i said this sub is now haunted

01:09:25.679 --> 01:09:27.279
i started posting scarecrow it's very

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:29.359
funny

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:31.440
and then everything jake does stands

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.520
against what war mode stands for

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.359
so i put up a picture of mance raider

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:36.960
with warmo and said don't bend the knee

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.400
i didn't say anything else

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.600
don't bend the knee now do you think

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.679
people might interpret that as perhaps

01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:43.279
don't bend the knee to matt and chains

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.359
or don't bend the knee because that

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:46.719
pains if you were on the reddit you

01:09:46.719 --> 01:09:47.920
would know it was all about jake the

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:48.719
puck

01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:50.400
not everything i want to read it not

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.880
everything's about you on matt james

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.239
[Laughter]

01:09:56.239 --> 01:09:59.040
i did it now i i also apologize to bill

01:09:59.040 --> 01:09:59.600
because

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.880
initially i was i felt like bill used

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.280
this

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.760
as a commercial for war mode and i

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.560
didn't like that

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.800
i spoke to the man he told me i was

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.400
wrong about that

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.480
and i believe him i believe it i don't

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.840
think he came from a place of

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.360
self-serving backstabbing his own

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.719
brothers for patreon money

01:10:16.719 --> 01:10:19.280
i don't think that's where he came from

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.880
just so we're clear on

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.640
people i think this was all just a swirl

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.000
of people coming from the best place in

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:24.800
their hearts dude

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.480

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.840
fest

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.679

incidences

now it seems like you had your eye on

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.560
the patreon the day of this incident you

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.159
want that to be the case because there's

01:13:58.159 --> 01:14:00.560
people

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.159

bit of a podcaster move now yes or no

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.760

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.239
[ __ ] decide that one

01:14:28.239 --> 01:14:30.239
why'd bobby what are you gonna say i

01:14:30.239 --> 01:14:32.320
just i just wanted to bring up the point

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.960
that we're discussing whether or not

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.880
this young man before us

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.960
is affected but we need

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.600
to listen to ourselves and think about

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.080
what is a [ __ ]

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.800
can we not decide that he who cast the

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.199
first

01:14:49.199 --> 01:14:54.080
[ __ ] might after all be a [ __ ]

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.400
i think that there's just too many

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.280
[ __ ] being thrown around here

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.360
and in order for us to judge whether or

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.120
not this beautiful young boy

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:07.199
is a [ __ ] or not is not our place

01:15:07.199 --> 01:15:10.640

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.880
laying blame

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.320
you got to take the blame you know what

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.120
i mean when you hire somebody to do a

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.040
job

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.080
you know what i mean and then you

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.239
subcontract that job and they do a

01:17:42.239 --> 01:17:44.320
[ __ ] up job

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.320
who's gonna who are they gonna call

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.760
that's what i said it was my fault did

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:48.640
you not hear me

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.159
well i know but a lot of people are like

01:17:50.159 --> 01:17:52.159
oh you know did it you know

01:17:52.159 --> 01:17:53.679
they got to kind of tell you how it is i

01:17:53.679 --> 01:17:55.280
think

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.360
a little bit break it down that's true

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:58.640
that is the truth

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.080
if you hire someone who did i said i've

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.480
manifested this entire situation

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.239
and yeah you took blame but i think a

01:18:04.239 --> 01:18:05.840
lot of people aren't giving blank i

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.480
think they're

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.960
a little bit scared to say you know jake

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.800
is gay obviously you know that's

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.400
not to be disputed but you gave him

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.840

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.920
you know what are you doing like

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.600
kool-aid what's up

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.639
how's it going good what did i say

01:20:26.639 --> 01:20:27.760
specifically that got

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.679
me called in i did i'm just bringing

01:20:29.679 --> 01:20:32.159
people in all right

01:20:32.159 --> 01:20:35.360
matt you were you were wrong uh from the

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.760
beginning

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.800
and then so it's not just

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.159
hiring this guy that was a mistake

01:20:46.159 --> 01:20:49.360
but directing him to go

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.080
radio dogs also was a mistake of course

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:52.560
which

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.080
you came to realize and i think that

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.239
that solved it

01:20:56.239 --> 01:20:58.080
so i think that we've reached a

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.000
conclusion already and you've

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.960
uh you know what's the word for you've

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:03.440
you've

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.480
rectified the situation

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:10.560
good so yeah yeah

01:21:11.679 --> 01:21:13.120
well i would say that one there is a

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.040
misconception that a man i'm like super

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.719
anti-piracy i don't really care it's

01:21:16.719 --> 01:21:17.360
just

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.800
it's a loyal dog dude i see people

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.239

yeah well i think also don't forget

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:25.440
about i got the thought of me bro

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.440
i i don't think it's that you are

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.960

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:32.239
claim was like oh it is illegal but i'm

01:21:32.239 --> 01:21:32.960

innocent
