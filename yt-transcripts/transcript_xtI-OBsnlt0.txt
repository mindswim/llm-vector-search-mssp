there's like a cage

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.600
now i didn't see nobody do this what

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.880
you're supposed to do is bring your

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.279
blanket hanging up on the cage and no

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:07.120
one can't peek in on you and you take a

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.040
shower peacefully

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.519
my first time i go in don't put the

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:12.560
thing up

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.160
i go when somebody's already showering

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.480
at the end going butt ain't snake it and

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.000
i sh and this is unheard of but you're

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.200
supposed to know who you're supposed to

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.040
not check one at a time

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.720
no it's just one dude i'm in there with

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.560
another dude showering thinking it's

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.560
normal and it's not and i'm not covered

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.399

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:30.240
know

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.470
is that a

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.470
[Laughter]

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.920
well i'll get more into that when we hit

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.240
state but in the county so you you

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.680
rolled up on someone i wrote up on

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.440
something that actually makes sense

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.040
because if you're in county prison for

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.760
like a dui yeah like that's like that's

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.760
where uncles go yeah

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.279
they're not trying to shower together

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.720
that's like yeah

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.480
but i figured like men in the gym though

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.279
they get naked all the time that is true

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:02.800
she's holding down like a six-year-old

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.720
man in l.a sometimes at the gym there's

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.040
literally no threat of rape exactly this

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.880
seems incredible i think your rape

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.560
senses are up remember what we're

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.240
talking about for exactly

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.920
what did this guy do when you entered

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.600
the show yeah give me weird looks no

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.160
he's actually about

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:20.640
look at me part his bed sheets

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.640
like you said you walk into the door

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.640
there's like a cage right you walk in

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.000
and there's

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.640
four four shower heads all right he was

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.079
at the one at the end yeah now it's at

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:31.360
the middle so there's one shot in

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.320
between us yeah there's no talon now he

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.160
might have been his first time too

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.360
but i remember he was like why'd you

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.079
walk in with you know why he put the

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:41.279
towel up

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:43.440
blanket up but still he was like why are

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.200
you in like in his mind he's like this

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.279
white boy in here with me was a black

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:48.240

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.600
walked

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.519
when i walked out that's when someone

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:55.200

him you know he's just piece of [ __ ] so

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.279
funny so how was it how was there like a

00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:56.960
ton of drugs and [ __ ] in there too yes

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.960
those are suboxones of big drugs how are

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.279
they getting them in uh now the county

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:02.960
when i was there it was through the mail

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.799
they got the suboxone strips yeah and

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:06.399
then the guards bring in the other stuff

00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:08.720
like heroin weed all the hard stuff but

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.200
i know what you do is you get a card you

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.039
cut you get a razor blade you cut open

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:14.240
the card

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.080
and you put the strips in there they're

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.600
kind of hip onto it now because the

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.120
boxing comes in a little strip like a

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.720
listerine breath strip and they they

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.480
melt in and other ways like i said it

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.600
was

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.679
it was the guards some guards were dirty

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:27.600
and getting paid to do stuff and visits

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.720
people swallowed balloons on visits now

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.120
a story about this kid right

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.320
that's known in the county and this is

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.720
one of the stories he's known about

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.240
they saw in the visit they saw him

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.840
swallow a balloon they knew he had

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.520
something yeah right so what they did

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.120
was they made it they wouldn't go back

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.960
to the block until he took a [ __ ] they

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.720
wanted to shoot him out right

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.320
so they do he's nervous to tell he's in

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.360
there for a long time yeah he story is

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.840
that he took the [ __ ] and he felt it

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.840
coming out that he was able somehow to

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.720
pinch his butt to catch the drugs and

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.240
still let the [ __ ] come out let it turn

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.440
out and caught kept the balloon kept the

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.919
balloon in there and got away with it

00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:05.760
no there's nothing right

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.279
so somebody should have raped him that

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:08.799
sounds like one of the most magical

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:09.919
buttons

00:30:09.919 --> 00:30:11.679

that your officer boxing team told me

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.159
then on friday there's no way that's

that's possible

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:29.679

i never saw the tests

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.720
now what processors do a lot and i heard

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.880
a lot of stories where they do it and i

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.480
actually had this happen to me more than

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.240
once too that they'll say oh why are you

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.000

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.600

just i think this was this definitely

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.559
what happened because i wasn't hot in

00:33:50.559 --> 00:33:52.480
case the test was wrong but he said i

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.720

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.399
i'm in the room with the head lady and

00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:58.320
my professor telling him that i did it

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.480
on friday there's no way that's possible

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:23.520
now so you're gonna do

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.200
i'm gonna give you triple ri which is if

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.960
you're non-violent

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.400
which i don't know how i got with that

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.079
because i simple saw on my record but

00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:31.520
they still gave it to me you get they

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.800
probably asked about the fight three

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.200
months oh

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.359
[ __ ]

00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:39.040
what's that what's the simple assault

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.160
like real quick

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.680
i started a fight my cousins beat

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.560
someone up in western

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.160
well we got we got knocked down we got

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.520
charged with simple assault and we got

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.599
knocked down sorority conduct yeah and

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:51.680
triple ri is non-violent

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.920
you get it which is three months off to

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.680
a year so every year you get three

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.920
months knocked off so when he told me he

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.359
goes you got six months in you're going

00:39:59.359 --> 00:40:01.520
to be doing a year upstate i thought i

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.760
was going to 18 and 36. i didn't i

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.359
didn't calculate the triple right i

00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:06.880
didn't know anything about it

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.200
so everyone i'm sorry i'm sorry what's

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.920
triple ri it's just uh when you're up

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.599
state it's a state sentence and you're

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:15.440
getting you don't have any violence on

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.040
your if you're if your charge is not

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.280
violent yes you can be qualified to get

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.040
triple right so that's your time you cut

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.320

county prison to grapefruit i don't know

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.680
you guys haven't

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.480
a different world age humongous

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.119
penitentiary the difference between a

00:49:35.119 --> 00:49:37.839
prison and penitentiary is the wall

00:49:37.839 --> 00:49:39.040
you know now

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.000
a lot of all federal institutions for

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.760
the most part are penitentiaries okay

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.119
you know i'm not sure they have walls or

00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:46.559
not but i know state for the state of

00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:47.920
pennsylvania the difference between a

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.480
penitentiary and prison is the wall you

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.720
know some have fences some judges have

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.680
fences

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.200
you know so it's fenced in it's it's a

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.319
picture

00:49:56.319 --> 00:49:58.880
no this wall if you have a big ass oh

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.040
got you yeah yeah two-story wall that

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.720
goes around the entire so that's the

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.800
penalty country

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.720
uh so granted it's penitential and a

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.920
prison

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.400
is a fence it's like the bar defense

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.040
four wires that's

00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:16.000
i said for state and state of

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.520
pennsylvania that's the difference and

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.200
other states should be different uh and

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.720
federal is different

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.720
uh but uh yeah for the most you know

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.559
upstate in pennsylvania that's the

00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:25.520
difference

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.680
now so greater ferg's got the humongous

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.839
wall now you i'm saying you're coming

00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:32.160

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.319
comedian really real funny he got it

01:04:06.319 --> 01:04:10.000
six to 12 for robin 7-elevens with a bb

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.079
gun

01:04:12.079 --> 01:04:13.680
he was a funny bastard though he's in my

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:14.960
bed he actually he's still racing me to

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.799
this day he's using somerset he's still

01:04:16.799 --> 01:04:18.160
in there he's actually he joined the

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.839
airing brotherhood whoa he said white

01:04:19.839 --> 01:04:21.599
supremacists which premise man there you

01:04:21.599 --> 01:04:24.400
go now i think the reason is is cause

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.839
when you're hearing brother their sign

01:04:25.839 --> 01:04:27.760
is the three leaf clover yeah and if

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:30.319
they see you have that on and the game's

01:04:30.319 --> 01:04:31.760
really big in that area and then you

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.960
come in with a free leaf clover you're

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.319
either going to join them or you have to

01:04:34.319 --> 01:04:36.559
black that out really i think he should

01:04:36.559 --> 01:04:38.640
be the aryan brotherhood

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.400
i believe

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.000
i don't know much about it but yeah

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.200
maybe you wanted to join a little bit i

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.640
think for sure because he did he's

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.880
looking at what he's doing 12 years

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.799

01:07:02.559 --> 01:07:04.319
couple of times

01:07:04.319 --> 01:07:06.000
during that three week period

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.240
14 yeah i think 2014. i definitely drove

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.760
past you during that time yeah that's

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.079
crazy so i got out there

01:07:12.079 --> 01:07:14.960
at that time yeah

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.559
you've seen that right yeah yeah they're

01:07:16.559 --> 01:07:18.000
now like i said that's the

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.359
classification detail but i don't know

01:07:19.359 --> 01:07:20.960
if you notice it's got the fence yeah

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.119
what they have is called the gun line

01:07:23.119 --> 01:07:26.000
now they have this on the yard they got

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.079
they got guards on towers they'll shoot

01:07:28.079 --> 01:07:29.440
every year between yard and there's a

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.599
line you go across that line they're

01:07:31.599 --> 01:07:32.960
gonna threaten to shoot you and i seen

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.319
that happen a guy tried getting a

01:07:34.319 --> 01:07:35.680
basketball

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.079
cross the line and hell broke loose all

01:07:38.079 --> 01:07:39.839
the guns came out cocked it's like he

01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:43.079
got games

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.240
yeah i'll never forget that

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.000
get down get back dude's trying to get a

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.520
basketball that was caught on a ball

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.720
right fence i would have shot it

01:08:10.559 --> 01:08:12.319
the reason is how they do it is i had to

01:08:12.319 --> 01:08:14.480
do tc programs

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.599
community

01:08:15.599 --> 01:08:18.400
and uh we said it's four months so how

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.000
they do it is whoever is short to the

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.880
minimum and i was short to my minimum my

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.480
minimum was august 25th 2015. that's

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.480
like one minimum of two years that's my

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.279
minimum of that's my chip ori minimum

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:33.199
okay so i'm 18 months unless you hit the

01:08:33.199 --> 01:08:35.120
button explain what that is hit the

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.719
button oh hit the max button yeah all

01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:38.640
right the max button is i said my

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.960
sentence was two to four four years i

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.560
did 18 months

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.400
i did not hit the max button

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.640
guys hit that max button because they

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.839
don't want to go out on the streets and

01:08:47.839 --> 01:08:49.839
be on parole you know and i'll tell you

01:08:49.839 --> 01:08:51.520
why when you hear my stories in a second

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.199
but pearl's just a pain in the ass at

01:08:53.199 --> 01:08:54.400
the time i didn't know anything about it

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.560
but there's so many guys

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.400
that said i'm just gonna hit they call

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.719
it they said i'm gonna max out i i think

01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:01.920
you came up with the max that's what it

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.839
is it's called the max bun they hit the

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.920
max bun they just say [ __ ] it i'm not

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.560
doing my programs i'm not doing i'm

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.319
doing whatever the hell i want to do so

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:12.000
you like to say [ __ ] you usually do what

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.279
i want but you're not going to do too

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:14.719
much because you get thrown in the hole

01:09:14.719 --> 01:09:16.000
yeah and you do not want to be in like

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.040
you want to get like one fight or

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.480
something but you want well a lot of

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.319
guys just do they've either fell year

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:21.600
but you're fairly young you're still

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.040
going to get to the hole you're just

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.319
going to not do your programs you're

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:25.839
going to keep filling out your programs

01:09:25.839 --> 01:09:28.640
because tc's real strict program

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.640
depends what tsu you want mine was kind

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:32.560
of laid back but still you had to do

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.120
stuff like it was four months

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.640
four different phases

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.120
and uh a lot of fun i never laughed so

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.359
hard and such a long time being in tc

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:44.239
really tony what is is

01:09:44.239 --> 01:09:46.319
your first phase you're just an overseer

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:47.920
now the end of my first phase i got

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.080
bumped to safety crew leader you have

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.759
the senior coordinator assistant

01:09:51.759 --> 01:09:53.199
coordinator

01:09:53.199 --> 01:09:55.520
safety crew leader

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.040
uh

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.520
one two three four and maybe like

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.040
i think there's eight spots all together

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.280
yeah and what is is as a therapeutic

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.360
community you know you're in a different

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.360
part of the jail way you know in general

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.640
population little sweet kind of i was in

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.120
and western states one was the oldest

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.920
running state prison in pennsylvania but

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.320
this the tc they actually built new

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.320
cells and stuff their conditions [ __ ]

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.080
air ignition was beautiful

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.360
and uh

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.560
i was you know i went up the ranks quick

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.400
i was safety crew leader when i was

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.440
supposed to be because someone got

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.480
kicked off

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.920
and then my second face someone hit the

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.040
[ __ ] max

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.640
it was like you know what happened so

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.000
many times so

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.760
and just so in the tc it's the

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.520
therapeutic thing and

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.960
therefore

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.040
and is it like kind of like almost like

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.880
an aaa type situation where you're in it

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.760
yeah in a meeting and you talk about

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:50.239
a and n a is a little different yeah uh

01:10:50.239 --> 01:10:51.679
community you could be in it for you

01:10:51.679 --> 01:10:52.400

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.199
i mean the same type of

01:10:57.199 --> 01:10:57.920
it's

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.520

bunk and i always picked the top bunk

01:13:10.159 --> 01:13:12.080
because i just felt more comfortable i

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.920

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.640
would have took him it definitely would

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.920
have been a little tougher

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.520
for his girlfriend being a [ __ ] for

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.440
everything [ __ ] just

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:42.800
i'm trying to think stuff he made fun

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.080
for me but he took tc so serious

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.080
yeah and it was a tc tiger that

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.320
i was getting i went from

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.760
safety crew to

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.960
towards the end of phase one which is

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.560
unheard of

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.719
you can't be on the line then i then we

01:13:56.719 --> 01:13:58.960
get and everyone votes yeah now i become

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.159
assistant coordinator and he doesn't

01:14:00.159 --> 01:14:01.840
even get on the line yet yeah he's so

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.120
pissed off right

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.520

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.760
right now i don't start losing my

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.440
authority until i get to and then i go

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.440
from assistant to senior coordinator

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.920
that's the highest you can go power

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.360
once you get the assistant you only can

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.520

01:15:59.199 --> 01:16:01.920
i had to do a a quote

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.520
i'd say something and everyone had to

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.719
say down the line when you were done

01:16:04.719 --> 01:16:06.159

01:16:06.159 --> 01:16:08.400
daily quote like

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.560
i don't know like keep it working then

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.320

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.320
you later right now my aunt sent me

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.040

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.400
i didn't ask her to she just sent me

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.800
these like these quotes that just keep

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.560
my spirit up and stuff yeah

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.400
the one i got dude i gotta remember this

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.679
man it was so stupid but it was so funny

01:16:25.679 --> 01:16:28.080
and it was like does everyone know

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.600
it was like something like this i i

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.840
asked a question a dumb question and

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.640
then

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.960
and i would say the answer was like

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.719
i can't forget it was like you know

01:16:36.719 --> 01:16:38.719
there's no eye in team or there's

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:40.480
something like that i'll think of what

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.400
it was yeah yeah but i would use it it's

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.880
like a generic no i use it every time

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.480
pretty much almost every time everyone's

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.159
getting sick and tired of and stuff but

01:16:48.159 --> 01:16:49.040
uh

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.640
so the one time i used that they're like

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.480
you can't use it with the

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.679
the counselors that ran the group they

01:16:53.679 --> 01:16:56.239
were gone one time and i used it and i

01:16:56.239 --> 01:16:58.239
just i couldn't say it i was laughing

01:16:58.239 --> 01:16:59.760
and everyone was cracking up

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.840
it was stuff like that but when i first

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:04.080
said it to belia and i said he was dumb

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.400
he was not fairly educated he was just a

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.239
funny little italian kid a little short

01:17:08.239 --> 01:17:10.000
[ __ ] funny [ __ ] i remember when

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.600
i said the quote to him right

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.360
and i stood up and i knew it was going

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.719
to be a funny quote because it was so

01:17:14.719 --> 01:17:16.800
dumb like the question and the answer

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.159
and then i said the question to him

01:17:18.159 --> 01:17:20.719
right now i never forget it now he's

01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:22.960
looking at me like this and when i said

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.600
when i asked him a question he was just

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.920
and i said the answer he was

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.320
he took it you saw him register he took

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.000
like a little bit to register

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.280
and he put a

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.120
big smile and he got it dude

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.360

know he came from a different jail to do

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.360

came in around the time i came in too

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:58.400

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.440
time but i think it was just selling

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.960
until you see the maintenance paperwork

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:06.880

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.480

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:35.840
and was right here okay

01:29:36.159 --> 01:29:39.360
yeah this piece of [ __ ]

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.639
so what happened so then you got out of

01:29:40.639 --> 01:29:42.639
there so what happened really after that

01:29:42.639 --> 01:29:43.840
the western like i said with the

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.040
population yeah you know and i get there

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.120
and i find out it's not as bad as even

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.400
there's no air conditioning the sellers

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.719
are so goddamn small you're walking i

01:29:52.719 --> 01:29:54.719
can almost go like this touch each side

01:29:54.719 --> 01:29:56.080
and you're with another guy better than

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.760
the phone with another old head

01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.520
[ __ ] had such a math on him but he

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.199
was so fun would get him wild out he was

01:30:01.199 --> 01:30:03.600
just like hello races just you know i

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.120
just say yo this [ __ ] you keep

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.480
getting these pro hits he got pro his

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.159
for dumb reasons yeah what he was in

01:30:08.159 --> 01:30:10.400
there for but i get there i get

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.639
accustomed and like a week later they're

01:30:12.639 --> 01:30:14.880
asking me to go to recovery block yeah

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.480
and you know i pretty much the [ __ ] off

01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.480
i ain't going there to that guard

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.600
because he should have sent me there

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.920
from the beginning exactly and everyone

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:23.760
is unheard of to put that [ __ ] down

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:25.360
because i'm looking at air conditioning

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:26.400
better

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:28.080
times take showers because the showers

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.080
are single showers over the tc blocks

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:32.480
yeah when you go to general population

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.800
you have five tiers but only four of

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:37.120
them were open so the first two tiers

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.360
was a row of showers and third and

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.960
fourteen was a roast so you opted for

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.960
group shower i have well the showers

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:44.400
these were it was

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.520
all stalls yeah half a door yeah yeah so

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.800
but it's sustainable in front of you

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.560
mike yeah we only had showers in the

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:51.840
morning time

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.400
during second yard yeah and right before

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.400
dinner and they would call out you know

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.000
the four first or three first you had a

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.920
run today a shower because it was only

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.239
like i guess there was like 15 showers

01:31:02.239 --> 01:31:03.840
and there's so many people on the block

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.360
so you the run to it you don't want to

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.080
be late for dinner yeah yes but i was i

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.920
was near the end so i had to take a

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:10.880
shower every day because i played

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.719
basketball every afternoon

01:31:12.719 --> 01:31:14.239
i always ran and got there right away

01:31:14.239 --> 01:31:15.520
got in the shower and that's where i saw

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:16.960
the stabbing go down because there's no

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:18.880
cameras in the showers yeah that makes

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.960
sense

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:22.400
so what you got out of there though they

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:25.040
probably should be allowed too

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.880
that's why i seen swords i was telling

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.120
matt the other day seeing guys

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.480
the knifes they come up with is

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:32.320
unbelievable in prison the ideas you

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:34.239
have to make a weapon for yourself i've

01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:36.560
seen a guy have a [ __ ] shank this big

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.000
though

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.159
like 10 of us last three [ __ ] days

01:47:54.159 --> 01:47:56.080
yeah it wasn't that long uh because no

01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:58.480
one you had to be unity everyone had to

01:47:58.480 --> 01:47:59.600
stick together

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.679
now our next big idea was the hunger

01:48:01.679 --> 01:48:04.400
strike did it work what worked next you

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.760
broke it who was the first guy to be

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.199
like you caught it it was a group of

01:48:07.199 --> 01:48:08.480
people with a lot of people okay then

01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.760
you're all like what's up tennis stay in

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:11.280
three days tendency to do it for three

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:13.360
days and then like pretty much what was

01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:15.280
the only time eating at all it's not

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.280
really nothing at all jesus

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:18.400
went through the

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:20.159
vending machines yeah but i said we

01:48:20.159 --> 01:48:21.760
wouldn't eat their meals

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.040
okay we got three meals a day they'll

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.040
serve us we wouldn't eat their meals and

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:26.880
everybody said that fruit was horrible

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.080
counted food

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:29.920
so so what was the story

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:32.639
same thing was to uh what was that oh

01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:34.159
now people will run from there all the

01:48:34.159 --> 01:48:35.920
time and you have to hit the fire alarm

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.000
to run now you're on pro you run from

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.080
this place you get up scott in charge

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:41.840
but the [ __ ] up thing is when you get

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:42.880
caught

01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.080
depending if you've been running more

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.840
than six months then you can go to grave

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.520
running and get a three you mean six

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:49.280
months like literally you can just run

01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:50.560
the door okay you can't just walk out

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.800
the door you might hit the fire alarm or

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:55.040
go during your time and just [ __ ]

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:57.119
leave you can leave but uh but you have

01:48:57.119 --> 01:48:59.280
to run from it you know they catch you

01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:01.119
you're in trouble but like i said it's

01:49:01.119 --> 01:49:02.719
called up scotland

01:49:02.719 --> 01:49:04.080
but if you're on the run for more than

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:06.080
six months on parole you only get three

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:08.480
to six months hit maybe nine in grade

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.719
four yeah but if you're under six months

01:49:10.719 --> 01:49:12.000
i know guys that just ran from this

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.400
place and turn himself in you go to a pv

01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:16.159
center now this wasn't really considered

01:49:16.159 --> 01:49:18.400
pv yet i think nowadays it was called

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:19.840
treatment but there was no like we went

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:21.520
through like three groups a day

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:22.880
so no treatment but there's white

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.880
supremacists exactly yes

01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:25.760
so

01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:27.280
you're selling cigarettes so you run

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.639
from this those guys ever run from this

01:49:28.639 --> 01:49:30.960
place turn in pro right away now this

01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:33.360
was dude you're doing a minimum 60 days

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.520
we'll go to either kentucky hall and do

01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:37.119
30 days well that's a new rule that just

01:49:37.119 --> 01:49:38.400
changed

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.960
when i did kentucky with 60 plus days i

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:42.639
went to coleman hall i did 34 days so

01:49:42.639 --> 01:49:44.400
they'd run to a place it was less time

01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:46.880
they'd be less time that's so funny now

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:49.440
i had such a bad parole record it all

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:50.639
you don't know what's going to happen to

01:49:50.639 --> 01:49:52.960
you though like i had a bad parole if i

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:54.560
took that chance that i might have been

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.000
they told me it maxed out great for it i

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.520
wasn't taking that for another so we're

01:49:57.520 --> 01:49:59.119
doing six plus days in this place in

01:49:59.119 --> 01:50:00.719
this hell and it's so bad

01:50:00.719 --> 01:50:03.119
so they they stop they what they do is

01:50:03.119 --> 01:50:04.800
they turn off the fire alarm so nobody

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:06.400
can run no more that's that can't feel

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.840
like the court exactly is not illegal

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.440
the guard told us about that so what we

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:11.520
did was somebody going on the pay phone

01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:13.760
and we called the fire department yeah

01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:14.880
now when the guy's on the phone calling

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:15.920
the fire probably because this i need to

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:17.440
talk to a staff member

01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:18.880
i get on the phone because i'm a staff

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:21.360
member i tell them what's going on they

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.280
sent in what'd you actually say to the

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:25.119
fire department i said listen my uh

01:50:25.119 --> 01:50:27.360
supervisor uh some reason he's being

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:29.040
bold-headed and he won't let us turn on

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:31.119
the fire alarm

01:50:31.119 --> 01:50:32.639
but i think it's a real risk for these

01:50:32.639 --> 01:50:34.239
kids for these sorry for these inmates

01:50:34.239 --> 01:50:36.639
in here uh if something were to go off

01:50:36.639 --> 01:50:38.480
you know they're in a small isolated

01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:39.760
place

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:41.600
would you bring it bring it if i could

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:43.280
come down here bring a pack of cadillacs

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.639
that's what we need it too we try to get

01:50:44.639 --> 01:50:45.840
it when we got pieces delivered to us

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:47.119
we're trying to find somebody who's a

01:50:47.119 --> 01:50:49.840
kentucky people delivery

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.840
piece of cell phones and stuff

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:54.080
cell phones you know with the pie in the

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.840
pie you know because you want a lot of

01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:57.199
cell phones in there but what happened

01:50:57.199 --> 01:50:58.639
now with this guy

01:50:58.639 --> 01:51:00.320
i told him all the stuff on the thing

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:02.480
you know they actually come to the place

01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:05.040
now like i said it's like a jail there's

01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:06.800
the front and we never can see the front

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:08.560
unless we get caught off for year or

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:10.159
call up to get mail

01:51:10.159 --> 01:51:11.520
so but someone went up there and saw

01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:13.520
there was a philadelphia fire i feel

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:15.360
what region was whatever district they

01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:17.119
were there yeah yeah and what they did

01:51:17.119 --> 01:51:18.239
was supposedly they just turn on the

01:51:18.239 --> 01:51:19.600
swish real quick

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:21.360
to make sure the fire alarms work back

01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:22.719
that's what they did you guys gotta do

01:51:22.719 --> 01:51:23.520
that

01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:25.440
second tap your second cue third attempt

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:26.400
this is good

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:27.920
were you were you excited when they got

01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:29.600
there oh that's so exciting

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.679
we wanted the place to shut down so bad

01:51:31.679 --> 01:51:33.840
it was so bad it wasn't like a prank it

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:36.639
was like a pretty scene

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:37.760
now

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:39.440
right before this next one what we were

01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:40.639
trying to do where there was a mouse

01:51:40.639 --> 01:51:42.159
running around down we're trying to kill

01:51:42.159 --> 01:51:43.920
the mouse and we're gonna do on food

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:45.920
we're gonna have somebody call kyw or

01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:47.520
fox news and we're going to put the

01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:49.840
mouse in the food while fox news was on

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.119
their way because supposedly someone

01:51:51.119 --> 01:51:52.800
said they did this before at either

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:54.719
coleman hall and the place got a lot of

01:51:54.719 --> 01:51:56.239
trouble there's all this media attention

01:51:56.239 --> 01:51:57.920
and [ __ ] we tried again next year we

01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:59.520
could have killed that [ __ ] mouse

01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:02.320
painted ass man

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:06.159
i'm like one of the leaders in this big

01:52:06.159 --> 01:52:07.599
group you know me and a couple guys

01:52:07.599 --> 01:52:09.199
getting trying to get this place shut

01:52:09.199 --> 01:52:10.080
the [ __ ] up

01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:11.119
it was literally

01:52:11.119 --> 01:52:12.800
i know it wasn't i'm here on this you

01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:14.719
make this worse man it gets a lot worse

01:52:14.719 --> 01:52:15.599
than this

01:52:15.599 --> 01:52:17.520
so then we're just plotting on our next

01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:19.840
thing dude our next thing is ready

01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:21.280
we decided

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:23.119
we decided to you know light the place

01:52:23.119 --> 01:52:24.960
on fire all right yeah maybe a little

01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:26.719
less fun

01:52:26.719 --> 01:52:27.920
now

01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:29.599
i'll yeah we're definitely gonna do this

01:52:29.599 --> 01:52:31.440
and the guy said well

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:33.840
if you kick the hole in the wall i like

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:37.199
the fire i said bet

01:52:37.199 --> 01:52:38.480
no problem i'll kick any hole in the

01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.000
[ __ ] wall as long as you light on

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.360
fire now i would have lit on fire if i

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:42.880
had to because i was kind of you know i

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:45.199
was really going for trying this place

01:52:45.199 --> 01:52:47.360
down i was really dedicated to it and i

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:48.480
would have went beyond because i was

01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:49.840
maxing out in three months what the [ __ ]

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:52.400
they gonna do to me yeah so when he said

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:53.520
listen you're probably getting a lot of

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:55.280
trouble for burning and if you kick the

01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:57.280
place if you keep the horn i'll write it

01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:59.520
down i said absolutely i'll kick as many

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:01.199
holes as you want i thought you were

01:53:01.199 --> 01:53:02.560
part of the job

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:03.280
now

01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:04.639
the only place we like to fire was in

01:53:04.639 --> 01:53:06.000
the bathroom and we're going to cut the

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:06.960
hole we're trying to light the

01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:09.599
insulation on fire uh no we could have

01:53:09.599 --> 01:53:11.040
like we could do in the room because

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:13.520
there's cameras and see what room it is

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.119
who isn't it yes it could have happened

01:53:15.119 --> 01:53:16.800
we get in trouble yeah so the bathroom

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:18.320
is going to get away with it but there

01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:19.679
was tile

01:53:19.679 --> 01:53:21.760
around the whole bathroom tower

01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:24.880
about five six feet whatever so i had to

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:27.040
kick up high so i went into the first

01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.599
stall in the middle bathroom and we used

01:53:29.599 --> 01:53:30.960
the middle bathroom because that's the

01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:33.280
only bathroom that had a front and back

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:35.840
exit it's in the middle of the building

01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:37.599
you know so i went into the first stall

01:53:37.599 --> 01:53:38.960
so you couldn't tell who was coming in

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:40.320
tonight though he was coming in you know

01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.000
we had a we playing that we three guys

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
go in me and three other guys went in

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.679
and then two went out that way one went

01:53:45.679 --> 01:53:47.599
in that way i stayed a little bit i lift

01:53:47.599 --> 01:53:49.840
myself up off the i went in the first

01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:52.239
stall left my hands on the side pulled

01:53:52.239 --> 01:53:54.000
myself up and did the jump jackie james

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.840
jump king dude and boot the [ __ ] hell

01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:58.000
out of the wall dude now listen

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.239
it was a perfect kick that like i was

01:54:00.239 --> 01:54:01.760
telling matt the fbi really want to

01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:03.760
investigate it they would have saw my

01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:06.080
shoe my size and what was said on my

01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:08.719
shoe it was so obvious that i can't hold

01:54:08.719 --> 01:54:11.679
that [ __ ] wall you know so i kicked

01:54:11.679 --> 01:54:14.320
the hole in the wall and uh

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:15.679
and then i come back to the rooms they

01:54:15.679 --> 01:54:17.440
get a hole's kick and he's he's counting

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:19.599
he's not he's like trying didn't think i

01:54:19.599 --> 01:54:21.040
almost want to kick a hole in the wall

01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:22.800
seriously hit it [ __ ] we've done here

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:23.840
you don't think i want to kick a hole in

01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:25.840
the wall yeah well we don't know it was

01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:27.760
a good idea and just took him a while

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:30.080
and finally got him to do it and i just

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.000
wouldn't catch on fire he was trying to

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.599
light the sheetrock on the floor

01:54:33.599 --> 01:54:35.679
like the installation on fire so i went

01:54:35.679 --> 01:54:37.199
with him to prove it to him and i see

01:54:37.199 --> 01:54:39.199
him he had the flame right to it because

01:54:39.199 --> 01:54:40.480
we're not gonna have lighters anyway in

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:42.480
this place i would imagine so he was

01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:44.159
trying to lay it on pla on fire and

01:54:44.159 --> 01:54:47.119
would have laid on fire so

01:54:47.119 --> 01:54:49.520
fourth intent failed fifth intent at any

01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:51.119
point during the burn the entire

01:54:51.119 --> 01:54:52.719
building down where you like during that

01:54:52.719 --> 01:54:54.800
plot where you guys ever just like maybe

01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:58.400
we should try to find that mouse again

01:54:59.199 --> 01:55:02.080
we made a trap try to catch them we uh

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:05.199
put food and uh i forget the trap it was

01:55:05.199 --> 01:55:07.040
a weird trap maybe the old shoe box was

01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:09.119
a stick now it was something like that i

01:55:09.119 --> 01:55:10.400
can't think of it man but it was

01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:11.840
something like that what was your final

01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:14.080
attempt my final attempt

01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:15.760
it was uh oh we wanted to flood the

01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:17.520
bathrooms we wanted to flood the place

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:19.040
put it on the water

01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.520
this is like biblical

01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:23.599
it's like moses yeah you're the moses of

01:55:23.599 --> 01:55:26.239
a pv center

01:55:26.239 --> 01:55:27.599
so the one bathroom where i kicked the

01:55:27.599 --> 01:55:28.560
hole

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:30.400
we uh you know the sink and all the

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.560
pipes were exposed

01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:34.800
mccluskey the kid you know it was pretty

01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:36.480
much my right hand man and doing all

01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.800
this science down he he does the first

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:41.280
he donkey kings talking kicks the first

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:43.199
pipes and just they just come off

01:55:43.199 --> 01:55:44.400
perfect

01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:47.040
so we there's about five sinks there so

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:48.560
we knock out all the pipes in the second

01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:50.400
we start running the water yeah and get

01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:52.639
out this is at like 11 this is after the

01:55:52.639 --> 01:55:55.119
last count before morning i think they

01:55:55.119 --> 01:55:56.960
do one more account before that

01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:59.760
and uh the place got a lot of water but

01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:01.199
all it did was get more [ __ ] up for us

01:56:01.199 --> 01:56:02.880
because we didn't flood it

01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:04.960
they just made everything everything wet

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:06.480
and also bathroom we had to use to take

01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:07.679
shits in

01:56:07.679 --> 01:56:08.880
and it was so bad because there was

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:10.239
urinals that guys are putting toilet

01:56:10.239 --> 01:56:11.679
paper in your

01:56:11.679 --> 01:56:13.760
uh clogging the urinals they just like i

01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:15.440
mean they made the bathroom so much

01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:17.360
nastier for us and we just

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:18.880
helped them even make it nastier like

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:20.239
that's why i think [ __ ] sat in there all

01:56:20.239 --> 01:56:21.840
night now now

01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:23.840
the bathroom was right across my hall

01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:25.679
let me start right across from my room

01:56:25.679 --> 01:56:27.760
now i had to walk around all around the

01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:29.040
corner all the way down the hallway to

01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:30.239
use the bathroom nighttime and i'd take

01:56:30.239 --> 01:56:31.040
a picture

01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:32.400
because the bathroom was shut down for

01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:34.080
like a week and a half

01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:35.199
right

01:56:35.199 --> 01:56:37.360
it's crazy man man the [ __ ]

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:38.800
maintenance guy comes in this one

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.560
because i felt bad and because he's the

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:43.440
one that passed my hole he had put

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:44.800
worse was seeing him underneath this

01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:46.239
thing putting the you know the the

01:56:46.239 --> 01:56:48.239
elbows back in the pipes and fixing them

01:56:48.239 --> 01:56:50.320
and his big meetings that harsh donkey

01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:52.080
kick yeah

01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:54.080
five donkey kicks but uh

01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.239
but i was like that stuff along with

01:56:56.239 --> 01:56:58.239
like you know people you know putting

01:56:58.239 --> 01:56:59.679
toilet paper in the urls and stuff he

01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:01.040
had this big speech with us and

01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:03.520
listening guys i have kids yeah um you

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:05.360
know because you guys had to stay here a

01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:07.040
couple of hours later you know and spend

01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.960
time with kids oh [ __ ] man it kind of

01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:10.400
sucked none of these attempts were

01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.880
working so somebody just got out

01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:14.560
yeah i got out yeah that was it that was

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.000
it man

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.840
i wanted to share to that place to help

01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:20.159
the guys still in there dude i said that

01:57:20.159 --> 01:57:21.760
every time i was the first time i was in

01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:23.520
there and everyone says it but once you

01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:25.280
get out yeah it's just like

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:27.040
i kind of want to though

01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:29.280

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:30.000
there

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.320
is so unfair because it's privately

01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:33.920
owned like you said you know

01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:35.280
and it's just privately owned [ __ ] what

01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:37.760
they do is it's really not they're not

01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:39.599
it's it's inhumane some stuff they do

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.679
someone needs to step up the reviews

01:57:45.679 --> 01:57:47.199
when you go to the one can talk place

01:57:47.199 --> 01:57:48.960

they're too busy hanging out talking

01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:16.560
with each other to make matters worse

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.560
most of them are muslim that work there

01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.639
