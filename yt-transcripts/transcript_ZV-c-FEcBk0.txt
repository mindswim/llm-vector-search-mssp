00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.080
box of crackers it's a safe place to fly

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.200
with mushrooms by the way you put them

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.559
in crackers like they look just like

00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:48.320
them as far as you know the eye in the

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.080
sky you know

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.760

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.360
little four-legged friends that

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.320
sometimes get into things dude

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.919
that's all i'll say about that that's

00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:59.280
all we can say although it's an organic

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.799
substance so it's like you know people

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:02.400

the four-legged friend's gotten into

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.799
weed before and that destabilizes

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:08.480
four-legged friends like i'm talking

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.240

shift

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.600
eventually the polls would shift where

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.880
you wouldn't get the anec because that

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.640

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:18.400

seven song mix that you blend together i

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.240

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.399
jamaica's cool dude jamaica [ __ ]

00:32:04.399 --> 00:32:05.279
rules

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:06.880
although yeah the white people bothered

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.320
the [ __ ] out of me they were

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.640
embarrassing what were they up to

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.120
the band there was like a nice outdoor

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.559
dinner area we were eating at and there

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:16.399
was like these three jamaican dudes that

00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:18.640
were just playing sick music yeah and

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.240
though they were like do you have any

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.600
requests what do you want and this lady

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.840
was like play bob marley and they're

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.840
like oh of course yeah

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.360
yeah that's one of the

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.760
and then the white people would respond

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.840
in patois

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.000
and that annoyed the [ __ ] out of me what

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.279
like the jamaican guys were teaching

00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:39.200
them how to say like iri yeah and they'd

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.720
be like okay man irie all right that's

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.640
cool no you have to go hit a full boom

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.159
o'clock like boomer class have an idea

00:32:46.159 --> 00:32:46.880

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.559
[ __ ] is this

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:56.720
like chad

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.120

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.840
good for them thank god he's never uh

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.799
made his way down there

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.039
that pedophile that might be the rights

00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:08.720
my favorite aspect of their political

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.159
philosophy right now is to call every

00:33:10.159 --> 00:33:12.159
single person a pedophile and be like

00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:14.559
[ __ ] pedophiles yeah i really enjoy

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:16.559
that it's very funny to be like tom

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:18.880
hanks

00:33:21.039 --> 00:33:23.440
that was suck so bad

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.320
you know because the left

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.840
mischaracterizes people and that's no

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.200
fun when you're like hey man that's not

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.960
right i just saw that but they didn't

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.159

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.360
to be on

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.960
some type of

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.840
like rapture religious channel

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.760
it was awesome that is pretty tight

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.039
we need to stop worrying about global

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.880
warming dude that's earth worship true

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.039
that that's very anti-biblical that's

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:06.880
actually true world government

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.040
which is what the earth warships want

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.520
very anti-biblical oh big time dude the

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.159
antichrist is coming yeah

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:15.679
yeah man give unto caesar's what does

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:17.440
caesar do but caesar's trying to grab

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.760
everything and it's like no no no it's

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.760
coming bro but yeah dude we were down

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.520
having a nice time in florida where we

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.440
all bought our flutes and stuff well you

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.440
know mine came from high spirits but uh

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.359
we're having users from white people

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:30.320
right

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.760
again um

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.000
the one guy the main person there i

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.119
believe is a man he's a carcasoid

00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:38.960
cockazoid yeah caucasoid

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.639
um but again i think they i would

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:42.639
imagine they work hand in hand with uh

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:45.119
with artists of all types they're music

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:46.079
first

they're like taking they're like wildly

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.320
exaggerated stories that are just taking

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.760
to be true because they like sound so

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.880

close your eyes and you breathe and you

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.079
start just picturing a thing and then

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:48.160

bro i'm i hate i don't want to be

00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:30.720
cavalier about it but it's about the

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.240
point where like i had to have been

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.160
exposed to it by now yeah had to have

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.680
been exposed to it

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.960

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.760
antibodies at all it might just

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.599
completely pass through me

00:39:51.599 --> 00:39:53.599

00:39:53.599 --> 00:39:55.359
i don't you know but i did apparently

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.720

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.040
should be

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.480
less severe

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.400
you have natural antibodies

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.920

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.400
pamphlet remember we do stations of the

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.760

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.359

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.560

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.440
ago

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.599
about i was like what's like the

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:08.960
because a lot of religions have like a

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.560
mystical sect and apparently jews do

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.240
have the kabbalah but i was trying to

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.160
look up like what is the actual like

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.520

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.160
like jewish spirituality and there's a

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.319
big problem in judaism right now we're

00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:24.079
like in this i was reading this a jewish

00:44:24.079 --> 00:44:25.920

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:29.760
tradition yeah but it's like it's kind

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.359

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.760
a friendly way if you get into a deep

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.880
fight in a tropical climate that's the

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.319
darkest you could that's like the

00:50:42.319 --> 00:50:44.160
darkest period of relationships possible

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.079

my girl to notre dame every year and i

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.280

00:50:55.359 --> 00:50:57.359
i would take it to notre dame game i'd

00:50:57.359 --> 00:50:59.520
be blacked out there would be a battle

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.720
you're having a game they like to fight

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.240
you when you're hammered because they

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.839

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.240
argument yeah i might have been

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.599
repeating myself here and there but that

00:51:15.599 --> 00:51:16.880

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.119
has kids tries to talk everyone who

00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:08.960
doesn't have kids but [ __ ] you guys

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.200
have to have it it's the craziest thing

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:13.040
to try to sign people up for

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.880
it's dude it's insanity to be like what

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.400
are you guys going to spit a couple yeah

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.480

it's i'm telling you it is fun it is

00:55:20.079 --> 00:55:21.760
joyous but to be like at the level

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.520
people are like how many people did it

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.280
to me of like yeah you guys have some

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.599

00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:29.920

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:31.839
oh it's like you're signing me up for

00:55:31.839 --> 00:55:34.799
what bro it's

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.720
she got a c-section and while they were

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.839
pulling the child out the child crapped

00:55:41.839 --> 00:55:43.440
in the wound

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:46.319
it got like deathly infected yeah this

00:55:46.319 --> 00:55:49.599
woman had to have like several surgeries

00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:52.160
she was like dying and my friend was the

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.920
is the father he was just watching his

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.680
bae like

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.880
he said he like walked into the room and

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.559
she was like green

00:55:58.559 --> 00:56:00.160
laying there like i need to go to the

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.599
doctor dude it's like it's infected

00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:05.520
he's like oh my god made a lot of

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.760
advances but childbirth does take even

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.280
if it's only for a split second it takes

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.520
you back to like [ __ ] 10 000 bc where

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.799
you're just like

00:56:12.799 --> 00:56:14.400
this could go very wrong yeah it's

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.319
probably way scarier back then but dude

00:56:16.319 --> 00:56:18.880
it's like wild back then i mean dude

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.000
yeah dude

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.520
you knock your bay up and there was like

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.680
a [ __ ] coin flip solid chance he's

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.760
gonna die coin flip yeah

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.760
coin flip and the chiron is also

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.280
probably cheering just becomes legend

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.559
obviously if the woman was like looking

00:56:30.559 --> 00:56:31.680
after him it's like well this guy will

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.799
become a great fighter yeah he's gonna

00:56:32.799 --> 00:56:34.160
be awesome jedi or whatever i'm gonna

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.000
hold it against him his entire life i'm

like like dudes would like tell me like

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.240

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.440
to jail for dirt bike stuff dude that's

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.799
not that's not the dude you need life

01:03:48.799 --> 01:03:51.440
advice from dude so he um

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.559
now they're spinning it because they're

01:03:52.559 --> 01:03:54.000
like they didn't want that to come out

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.119
like because it's like you know you

01:03:55.119 --> 01:03:56.240
don't want anything to make the

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.319
lockdowns look bad yeah hundred thousand

01:03:58.319 --> 01:04:00.480
people dead from the [ __ ] dude from

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.400
overdoses which again where did that

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.319
come from

01:04:04.319 --> 01:04:06.160
remember when all of a sudden like the

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.520
same companies that are saving us we're

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.319
like oh yeah here you're gonna have

01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:09.920
heroin by the way yeah the people we're

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.160
trusting our health advice with gave us

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.280
heroin

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.280
and now now that like now they're saying

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.720
it's disproportionately affecting black

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.559
people latinos that's because all the

01:04:18.559 --> 01:04:19.839
white people who would do it are dead

01:04:19.839 --> 01:04:20.799
from it

01:04:20.799 --> 01:04:21.839
so it's like they're like well now

01:04:21.839 --> 01:04:23.359
they're the numbers are creeping up so

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.720
now it's like

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.160
it's hitting them real hard and they're

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.920
now they're turning the

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.400
surge in opiate overdoses into a racial

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.640
issue and it's like you [ __ ] do

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.319
of course they are you [ __ ]

01:04:34.319 --> 01:04:35.920
weasels they're pretty good it has

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.520
nothing to do with the fact that you

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:40.960
sold heroin yeah to

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.240
everybody claiming it wasn't addictive

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.920
and all of a sudden it's like well you

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.920
know race this is all because of racism

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.680
and it's like dude i read that and i was

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.200
just like

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.720
it's a good move

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.119
sell people the optics are gonna be

01:04:55.119 --> 01:04:56.640
drugs and then be like you guys are

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.640
being racist

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.640
wait what what happened

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.079
i can't believe how racist you guys are

01:05:02.079 --> 01:05:03.839
being a hundred thousand dead that's

01:05:03.839 --> 01:05:05.839
pretty racist this is you guys it's

01:05:05.839 --> 01:05:08.400
[ __ ] up not us it's crazy it's [ __ ]

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.480
crazy man i i read that and i was like

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.160
[ __ ] dude

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.559
i tried to warn my bros i said guys dude

01:05:14.559 --> 01:05:16.400
i know you think the migos are cool and

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.480
all this [ __ ] but like i'm telling you

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.640
these things are wildly addictive

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.839
to be honest though there were a lot of

01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:23.119
people that were being pretty racist

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:24.240
about it

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.319
what i remember some black some black

01:05:26.319 --> 01:05:27.599
people

01:05:27.599 --> 01:05:29.359
oh now it's white people you got a

01:05:29.359 --> 01:05:30.960
problem with it it's like no this is a

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.880
pretty serious problem dude

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.640
that's my that was my argument guess

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.319
what

01:05:36.319 --> 01:05:37.680
now it's come to you guys oh it's

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.520
[ __ ] and i bet we all care the same

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.039
because it's not racist bro they're

01:05:41.039 --> 01:05:43.599
gonna have their that's gonna skyrocket

01:05:43.599 --> 01:05:45.359
that's gonna skyrocket up dude that's

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:47.520
like because the whites got hit with it

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.000
and it's just it just white people it

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.240
just goes out white people dude so when

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.440
i was in graduate school they talked

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.799
about that they're like well nobody

01:05:54.799 --> 01:05:55.920
cared about crack but everyone cares

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.200
about opiates and i'm like dude it's

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.640
different though like your doctor didn't

01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.920
