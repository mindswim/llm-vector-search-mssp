haven't it's a dude this is an age-old

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.800
debate

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.440
yeah well it's just cause if

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.959

00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:58.480
the way you jerk off

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.240
hey you know what i mean yes exactly

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.080
it's not for everyone i understand that

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.000
then it could probably

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
like if i if i spent like an hour down

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.080
here beating off well it's not even just

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.600
that it's not just that it's the fact

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.600
that you're

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.120
it's like you're expending like you're

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.360
when you you're semen in your body is a

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.120
source of like energy and vitality and

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.399
when you're just spilling it all the

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:19.920
time willy-nilly you're not you know

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.279
living up to your full potential is that

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:23.839
true definitely dude if i if i hold it

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:26.240
it was you vitality oh it's in your body

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:26.959
yes

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.560
dude absolutely there's a ton of

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.160
vitamins and minerals and semen that

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.360
when you're just shooting it out every

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.959
day you're losing out on a ton of stuff

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:34.880
so your body absorbs

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.800
the body reabsorbs semen

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.560
really after seven days of not coming

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.000
your testosterone i think goes up

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.680
doubles or quadruples or something like

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.839
that what yeah dude you're not supposed

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:45.680
to be coming all the time yeah you are

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.040

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.560
dishwasher told me too you only get so

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.080
many and after that your dick doesn't

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.080
work it's true though

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.360
you've talked about this too i mean

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.800
technically that guy's definitely right

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.320
yeah you do have a certain number of

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.399
nuts you have so many but dude so like

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:00.000
and that's as soon as that when i was

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.440
fapping i stopped going to the gym for a

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.240
week

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.080

i'm sorry this is the way that that

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:12.160
mexican guy is right

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.839
the mexican guy who says you have a

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:16.000
certain number of jerk-offs yeah is

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.959
correct

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:19.440
yeah but it's not set

certain amount of [ __ ] no that's just

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.040
like an hourglass dropping but i think

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.240
it's more of like the structure of your

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.680
dick you can only let that thing rise

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.600
and fall so many times

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.839

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.480
stage

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.040
i was [ __ ] falling asleep up there

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.959

00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:17.680
not like me really uh i did all right

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.680
but you found them

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.959
and they all kept getting upset they got

00:13:20.959 --> 00:13:22.160
actually offended did we even say that

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.839
on this podcast that you're at everyone

00:13:23.839 --> 00:13:25.200

[ __ ] white trash which is hilarious

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.560

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.920
with the legend

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.360
you shook hands with the legend and he

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.720
went right to your room and jerked off

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.399
twice i masturbated twice he probably

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:37.760
jerked off three times that's why he's a

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.340
headliner

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.320
[Laughter]

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.920
this is how much of a legend he is he's

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.160
probably he gets a better hotel

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.440
does he really he didn't even stay in my

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.839
hotel damn he's a good enough headliner

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:49.200
that he can be like i'll go to your club

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.880
but i'm not staying at that shitty hotel

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.399

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.519

00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:04.959
and then he orders

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:06.800
he usually orders dinner and then one

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.639
more meal and takes it home and they got

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:11.040
to pay for it all yeah he's a [ __ ]

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.519

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.519
you guys were in with a bunch of white

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:19.279
trash so united i drove to connecticut

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:21.519

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.720
telling you it was central pennsylvania

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.240
like it was like central to western

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.519
pennsylvania you think they recently

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:28.720
just got all trumped out with the

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.240
presidency they got trumped out hard it

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.760
probably was a bunch of volvo drivers

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.480
and trump won they're like yep yep oh

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.279
maybe

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:37.600
maybe hilarious if they they crash their

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.360
volvos in the review and it went full on

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.120
trump status that'd be sick that'd be

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.959
awesome if they bought in yeah they just

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:44.800
went all in on it

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.639
they just sent scouts to central pa and

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:47.680
they're like this is how we're going to

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.800
get all right this is how we're going to

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.240
live yeah it was something a little

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.440
weird about being near sandy hook yeah

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.120
like i was near sandy hook when i pulled

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.000
over to get something i didn't know that

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.079
was connecticut yeah that seems like a

00:14:58.079 --> 00:15:00.639
new town it almost seems like the

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:02.560
like you know the earth has its core it

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.000
seems like the core like the the

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.680
epicenter of like angry nerds in

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.880
connecticut

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.480
seems like a good breeding ground for

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.040
like really hot angry like pissed off

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.639
angry nerds what do you mean i don't

00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:14.079
know connecticut's just jammed between a

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.199
bunch of different cities i feel like

00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:16.399
you get a good nerd in there he can

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:17.170
explode

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.480
[Laughter]

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.079
oh you mean like a school shooter a

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:24.240
little more or less yeah all right

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.000
so i

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.240
it was just weird to be like near sandy

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.480
hook and then see a guy drive by in like

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.000
a huge pickup

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.399
with like a a blue lives matter and an

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:36.639
american flag house on the back like

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:39.360
house flags how soon after seeing sandy

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.320
hook did you jerk off

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.920
that night

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.839
you're disgusting you took up five hours

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:47.440
you judged all five hours after seeing

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.600
sandy hook yeah oh my god you didn't

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.600

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.920
have i may have should at least take one

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.160
off for sure i got one off that night

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.600

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.720
yeah she wasn't thinking about it you

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.160
should have jerked on a knee but anyway

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.199
what i was trying to say

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.440
was it's just funny to see a guy who's

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.560
still clearly pro gun rights oh outside

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.320
of sandy hook driving in sandy hook what

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.519
do you like

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:15.279
he had a [ __ ] blue lives matter flag

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:16.720
and an american flag

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.000
do you think he's being a [ __ ]

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.079
elevated pickup truck with like the

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:22.560
exhaust he loves guns yeah safe to say

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.480
safe to say undoubtedly

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.000
but it's funny to see it it's like damn

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.759
dude even you you didn't you didn't

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:29.360
learn anything from that last that's

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.800
where the conspiracy go around that's

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.800
where the conspiracy came in

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.320
like i'm i'm already with people being

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.160
pro guns yeah guns are kind of [ __ ]

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.959
cool

00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:39.040
but if i lived in sandy hook you'd be

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.639
against them i might that might have

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:42.240
changed my mind

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.079
now i think san diego changed my mind

00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:45.839
quite a bit and i live here nothing will

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:48.000
change my minds on guns what do you mean

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.120
i think people should be able to have as

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.880
much guns as they want

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.480
i love guns dude

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.839
that's cool let me state for the record

00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:55.440
dude i [ __ ] love guys that's uh

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.519
that's fine that's not a big deal yeah i

00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:58.959
don't i don't have a problem with people

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:00.399
people that are pro guns i don't have a

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.759
problem and i get that no i get the

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:02.959
argument it's like

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:04.559
if they shouldn't have ar-15s of shoot

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:07.120
up schools and stuff in my head i'm like

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.280
i still think ar-15s are sick as [ __ ]

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.919
15's are sick i want one but and you

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:13.760

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.880
kindergartners that got shot i did 20

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.480
[ __ ] little kids i do but right now

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.520
some guys was like yo you want to buy an

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.760
air 15 for 200 bucks i'd be like yes

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.160

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.000
maybe i don't i don't disagree that

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.600
people should have guns yeah i know you

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.039
don't but i think it should be a little

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:30.880
more rigorous yeah with background

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.240
checks and a little more i don't know

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.919
that's a tough nra sticker to drive

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.919
around up there yeah you're absolutely

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:37.200
right you're a little closer to the

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.120
beehive with that one sure he probably

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.480
actually he probably has an nra like

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.200
magnet he takes on off his car around

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.720
around sandy hook driving around with

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.640
the [ __ ] don't tread on me snake on

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.720
your car is like a little like

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.400
yeah just something about it's a little

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.000
weird it is and it's also funny that

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.760
like hillary definitely swung down there

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.200
like we need to get rid of guns and

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.120
everyone's like [ __ ] you

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.240

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.880
connecticut was it's a weird mix up

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.400
there yeah there's also a lot of

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.320
different races mm-hmm because they're

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.840

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:11.120
hartford's like a shitty city yeah

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.400
connecticut's small enough that people

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.360
are usually

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.039
boston or new york yeah and then uh

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:18.720

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.200
surrounded by white trash surrounded by

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.200
white trash and puerto ricans really

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.280
lots of pr's up there pr is a good mix

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.760
for strictly puerto rican audiences

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.840
a blast dude pr's are like the one race

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.679
you can still get away with making fun

00:18:41.679 --> 00:18:42.400
of

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.000
yeah pr's are like

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.200

this one guy that was super white trash

and like while i was on stage just

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.760

were people asking me [ __ ] questions

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.120
during my set like just talking

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.159
it was crazy

00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:29.679
so that sucked it's usual sign of low

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:31.200
intelligence yeah sure

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.799
that's the people that want to interact

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:33.760
with

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.320
the person on stage with just a question

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.000
that you're thinking that means that was

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.440
rattling around that guy's brain for

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.120
probably like five minutes coulda you

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.320
could have been waiting waiting all

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.600
night he probably can go to the comedy

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.960
show ask the guy about football in

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.710

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.280

and we're back

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.000
um dude i actually i put your theory to

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.080
test about girls liking shitty music all

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.679
weekend it's true dude it's uh it is we

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:44.000
were in a car and we had a rental so

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.360
brittany drove the whole time so she

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.159
controlled the radio and it's like

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:49.600
i i've actually i was thinking about him

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.720
like all the music we listened to it

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.400
just sucks it's just all like weird girl

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.360
songs and uh i think what it is

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.400
is that

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.960
it's more so hot chicks have bad taste

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.080
in music

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.520
maybe

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.280
i'm this is through my experience it's

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.720
definitely the hotter ones the better

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.400
your taste in music you're probably not

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.880
that hot and if you're so hot all you

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.480

but no i think she looks good so i was

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.000
getting more like uh because there's not

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.399
a lot of like

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.960
there's not a lot of points within like

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.039
white chicks for thickening up no you

00:28:31.039 --> 00:28:32.399
know what i mean so she's getting her

00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:34.559
like her ants and like all these people

00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:35.520
would be like oh britney you get a

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.720
little butt on you so like you know

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.760
they're definitely checking out each

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.120
other's butts and comparing so it's a

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.480
whole different ball game so

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.760
thicker than a snickers thing you gotta

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.760
watch that with black ladies right why

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.679
they [ __ ] blow up don't they not

00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:50.000
really dude no no they a lot of it all

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.520
depends they can't i felt like that was

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.760
a stereotype of like black ladies so i

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.520
feel like every old black lady sees a

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.240
[ __ ] house

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.000
that can't happen

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
no that can't happen then i'd watch

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.919
ladies who've eaten like [ __ ] and

00:29:03.919 --> 00:29:06.080
they're just like

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.399
great shape sure i think it's probably

00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:10.159
this they can it's they have to work

00:29:10.159 --> 00:29:12.000
harder to house out because like i i

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.640
just feel like black ladies can eat i

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.080
used to date a lady who ate like six

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.080
laffy taffys every night before bed

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.320
she had a decent body dude she had a

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.000
decent body

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:22.720
so

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.640
black ladies

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.559
without getting too depressed about this

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:28.799
uh black ladies they probably get

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:30.399
black people probably get fatter because

00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:31.840
their diets

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.440
their diets are pretty the white man is

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.200
forced upon them is like he just

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.200
snickers right now not even that dude

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.279
it's like i've talked to co-workers

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:40.880
before whether i think i might even said

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.559
this but this guy's putting like 14

00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:44.559
sugars into his coffee not exactly yeah

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:46.000
i've seen that and i'm like dude you're

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.440
going to get diabetes he's like it runs

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.720
in my family dude if i'm going to get it

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.080
i'm going to get it i'm like

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.120
no bro type 2 diabetes like so yeah the

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.520
diets i feel like i feel like definitely

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.360
uh you get you get some black health

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.039
nuts but for the most part the health

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.960
revolution is a lot of like white people

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.360
gluten free dairy free privilege to be

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.799
like no i don't want to eat fast food

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:07.200
today i don't eat dairy sure just

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.039
cutting dairy out just be like uh i'll

00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:10.640
eat soy milk but there's a lot a lot of

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.000
black people are lactose intolerant too

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.080

this meditation book and then like a

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.879
good four chapters of dedicating to like

00:34:32.879 --> 00:34:34.240
how to handle your [ __ ] when she's

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.800
saudi so i can just tell her that dude

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.320
it's so funny this guy it's like he

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.520
wrote this book just to deal with his

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.760
[ __ ] babe i handle it this is a new i

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.760
used to [ __ ] i used to spaz and lash

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.839
out dude i don't spazz ever but i'm just

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:48.240
like what are you [ __ ] mad at like

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.760
why are you doing this

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.599
you can't even get accusatory that can't

00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:53.119
even get accusatory

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:55.119
it should be like well you instigate and

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:57.359
i'm like yeah maybe i instigate a little

00:34:57.359 --> 00:34:58.560
but yeah

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.079
i don't know this

00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:01.920
it starts out with her being a salty

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.200
[ __ ]

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.440
and then my way of dealing with that is

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.960
being like you're acting like a [ __ ]

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:07.920
idiot

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.280
yeah that [ __ ] crush and that's

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.440
terrible it crushes them i yo my whole

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.599
thing now is that when my [ __ ] gets too

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:16.240
salty i completely just get super nice

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.760
and i'm just like i'm so sorry i didn't

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.800
mean to do that i don't know what's

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.240
going on but she'll know what i'm doing

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.839
if i do that yeah but there's ways you

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:22.960
can do it

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.800
or you can be like you know where you

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.079
just gotta let him [ __ ] spat i let

00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:27.599
her spazz on me all the time and i wait

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:29.200
and then i get a good [ __ ] i'm sorry

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.359
i'm like it's totally fine

00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:32.880
so i've been ice cold i've been cool but

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.160
i've been doing half hour blocks of

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.920

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.079
i was like damn dude that's crazy half

00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:45.359
an hour's tough man i've been trying to

00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:47.359
do like just sit on the floor half an

00:35:47.359 --> 00:35:49.040
hour uninterrupted

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.560
i sit in my computer chair and i listen

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.280
to [ __ ] like dude

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.040
i sit in my chair you just take a nap

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.480
every morning no i don't i don't sleep

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.760
dude i don't sleep i'm i'm unstoppable

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.040
right now and i've stopped trying to be

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.720
right against my [ __ ] that's the thing

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.720
if like using logic is just not the

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.200
weapon to use what against [ __ ] it just

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.040
goes nowhere as soon as i get her into a

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.280
corner of like yeah but you said this so

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.119
i and then it makes all it all makes

00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:15.200
sense and they'll just pivot they're

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.040
you're on like a pure 2d realm of

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.280
arguments and they're in like a 360

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.359
virtue they're like they can spin and

00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:23.040
move and jump and you're just like a

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.640
two-dimensional pollywog dude you're

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.960
just like

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.079
nelson mandela they he would uh all the

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:38.240
guards that were like coming

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.760
like i guess

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.200
guard him be like mean to him he'd be

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.880
super nice to them so they'd start being

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.920
nice to him they'd have to take the

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.760
guards away and switch them yeah all you

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.359
can do your babe's basically your prison

00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:48.720
warden dude so you have to just make her

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.119
you got to be nice to her but my baby

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:53.040
like that's that was her pivot she was

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.599
like i was like man you really you're in

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:57.359
a terrible [ __ ] mood like what

00:36:57.359 --> 00:36:59.599
happened what's wrong she's like it's

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:02.079
not she's like you [ __ ]

00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:03.599
you instigate

00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:06.079
yeah it's like

00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:08.400
yeah i mean i instigate after you're in

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.920
a bad mood

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.359
yeah i'm going back i do the same thing

00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:13.280
i'm like what happened that started this

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.200
fight that we're in now yeah and she's

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.680
like well you kept pushing it

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.720
it's like

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.200
yeah i know but what happened to start

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.359
this fight like it's just the constant

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:25.440
pivot it's like it's my fault for now

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.040
that we're fighting so you're you're

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.560
you're trying to go towards the bottom

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.079
of the [ __ ] abyss dude you're trying

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:31.200
to get it

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.960
what is the problem here what's the

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.200
problem that started this no you can't

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.599
it's like but then you screamed at me

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:38.720

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.200
first of all i didn't [ __ ] scream

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.920
i just slightly raised my voice

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.079
and it was after it was mid-fight it was

00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:47.119
mid-fight

00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:48.640
they'll do that and it'll be like what's

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.640
the matter it's like nothing i'm fine

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.599

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:53.520

races going off of like three or four

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.200

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.040
guys talking about how

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.000

their aids dicks out of here

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.680
the laborers i used to work for

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.280
the one guy would constantly this black

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.800
dude would call the africans monkeys all

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.560
the time yeah they're all like

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.160
ruthlessly and like they would they

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.760
would be 10 feet below us and he would

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.440
drop drywall on him and [ __ ] like he

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.560

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.640
british people

00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.760

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.359

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:19.200
imagine this too it's like

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.960
you're an american black guy and a lot

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.240
of white guy i'm not saying this is the

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.520
whole thing behind racism but there's

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.359
the whole thing with like if you're a

00:49:25.359 --> 00:49:27.520
white guy black guy there's a weird dick

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.200

girlfriend i think you're liable to like

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.920
a hundred thousand probably you should

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.440
get some sort of grievance that'd be

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.880
tough money didn't think they have funds

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.960
for that that's tough money to take what

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.760
be like you [ __ ] my girlfriend

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.040

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.839

00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:44.160
autographed album i'm taking autograph

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.559
bruno mars

00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:48.000
that's a tough pill to swallow that

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.880
happened to uh some dude fletcher cox

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.960
from the eagles [ __ ] his wife he got

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.720
money for it and he's like sue and

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.720
fletcher cox i feel like that ruined my

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.400
marriage yeah that'll definitely do it

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.480
sure get an eagles player [ __ ] yeah

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.160
an eagle's defensive lineman comes in

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.920
and deep dicks your wife i mean just

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.920
think about the fact that i can push i

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.440
can push on my torso and get an extra

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.119
inch out if i weighed 300 pounds of all

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:10.400
muscle they'd probably push an extra

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.160
four inches out of their body so when he

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.680
lays down on her it's probably just like

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.680
it's probably just so much weight dude

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.839
she that's just a hot white lady from

00:53:19.839 --> 00:53:22.000
the south getting a bowl and imagine

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.599
your wife imagine like you know probably

00:53:23.599 --> 00:53:25.040

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.559
probably limping around oh should i

00:53:26.559 --> 00:53:28.000
[ __ ] lymph in here and there and he was

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.359
like what's happened to you he's like

00:53:29.359 --> 00:53:30.640
horseback riding it's like all the

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.260
eagles are wrong

person i'm talking about who's reigning

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.680

not as impressive i saw his flash but he

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.440
might be a grower he might be a grower

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:25.160
and that was in game

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.040
he's also six eight so i'm expecting

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.520
like

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.280
all right that's weird sure i learned

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.559
also that you can't screenshot

01:02:12.559 --> 01:02:13.680
instagrams

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.520
what when you screenshot instagram i get

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.280
people get a notification

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.200
what bro i've been doing this all the

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.119
time what i whenever i want to roast

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:23.200
someone i screenshot their insta

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.880
dude a little thing a thing comes my

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.079
little brother told me a little camera

01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.520
flash comes next to the thing and it

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.720
tells you who screenshotted your thing

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.880
no that's snapchat

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.160
i think it's instagram now that's

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.839
snapchat screenshot someone's insta

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:37.920
right now screenshot mine someone all

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.119
right let's test this actually this

01:02:39.119 --> 01:02:40.559
would be a good real time test you're

01:02:40.559 --> 01:02:43.119
lying i don't think i am man i know for

01:02:43.119 --> 01:02:44.960
a fact snapchat does it

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.480
i don't think so because the whole point

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.839
of snapchat was to do that dude if

01:02:47.839 --> 01:02:50.240
that's the case i've i have i've burned

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.599
bridges dude because i like i used to

01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:52.880
screen shots i've been shot in these

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.960
same [ __ ] people

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.160
i know

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.599
let me see let me see if it works for

01:02:57.599 --> 01:02:59.359
you because i would love to start

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:00.559
talking [ __ ] on people again through

01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:02.160
their instagram let me say i'm telling

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.680
you it's snapchat

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.599
i don't know man

01:03:05.599 --> 01:03:08.480
all right i have this

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.880
so you didn't get any sort of thing next

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.319
to the picture my little brother might

01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:14.240
be [ __ ] with me man

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.400
god damn it i think he tricked me all

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.400
right you're all right

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.319
okay good i think he's tricking me dude

01:03:20.319 --> 01:03:21.760
because i was like [ __ ] my pants

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.880

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.119
that's worrisome i'm worried about it

01:03:25.119 --> 01:03:26.400
right now it's a sick thing to tell

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.559
people though i think i think i remember

01:03:28.559 --> 01:03:29.839
him telling me he did this to someone

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:31.119

someone with the railroads and you use

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.799

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.960
immigrant instincts took over and

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.880
and he was in a horrible mood so at

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.400
halftime he just

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.159
gets up and starts trying to play music

01:10:12.159 --> 01:10:14.080
on the alexa

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.760
and just to take off this yeah he was

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.360
just trying to relax and every song he

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.679
would pick i would just blast i would

01:10:19.679 --> 01:10:21.679
blast dmx as loud as i could because i

01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:23.840
control the spotify from my phone

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.600
so i could be like alexa play the

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.360
temptations

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.080
just

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.360
see this the [ __ ] [ __ ] i've been

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.400
talking about and he was like turn out

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.440
turn it off shane you [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.000
it's not on christmas it's christmas

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.400
turn it off no dmx on christmas

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.080
and then i found a dmx christmas song

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.520
but he was genuinely like he was trying

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.960
to fight me

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.640
he was like my mom was getting in

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.679
between yeah he was genuinely like you

01:10:51.679 --> 01:10:53.920
[ __ ] [ __ ] meanwhile the [ __ ] off

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.280
your brother-in-law's empire she's

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.120
growing

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.560
is massive

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.199
my sister he bankrupted my sister she's

01:11:01.199 --> 01:11:04.000
oh my god it was just like

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.840
it was chaos and then my dad goes back

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.280
inside to watch the game and what's

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.760
really funny was a nine point spread

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.120
nine and a half

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.360
and he had the eagles and they were up

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.719
three

01:11:14.719 --> 01:11:17.760
as time expired they scored a touch they

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.040
defense scored to make it nine points

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.520
so at this point

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.199
they it was nine and a half so it was

01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:27.199
nine points and it was like oh [ __ ] i

01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:28.159
was like i think they have to kick the

01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:30.159
extra point i think they're required to

01:11:30.159 --> 01:11:32.000
kick the extra yeah yeah and then i'm

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.360
pretty sure

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.000
things got a little hazy because then uh

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.440
i think they don't they like

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.520
respectfully knelt or something oh are

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.080
you serious i think hold on i gotta

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.159
cover the spread yeah yeah yeah yeah

01:11:44.159 --> 01:11:45.760
cause don't you gotta win by if it's if

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.000
you tie it goes to the boogie

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.560
uh tie well you can't tie because it was

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.080
a half it was nine and a half points got

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.440
you guys you got you

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.520
but i'm pretty sure yeah it was nine and

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.840
a half and they scored a touchdown as

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.679
time expired and then didn't kick the

01:11:59.679 --> 01:12:01.120
extra point

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.840
to make it 10. sucks so he was like yes

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.320
go go go and they didn't kick you the

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.440
last play of the game and then they were

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.760
like [ __ ] it nine points and he was like

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.719
come on

01:12:10.719 --> 01:12:13.280

over there yeah they're 365 it is funny

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.920
to blame a year yeah like how people

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.639
were like [ __ ] this 2017 for me was a

01:27:44.639 --> 01:27:46.400
real

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.639
[ __ ] performance

01:27:48.639 --> 01:27:49.600
i think i think i'm going to bring it

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.880
back in 18.

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:53.520
yeah i uh i just i pulled up a little

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:55.040
bit at the end of it but i had a pretty

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.840
[ __ ] stinky 2017 yeah i wasn't on my

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.560
a game at all dude i was [ __ ] smoking

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.159
joints eating weed gummies pretty much

01:28:02.159 --> 01:28:04.320
for the most of it i wonder nothing is

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.760
this what just happened is this how you

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.880
become that's one thing i've been

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.560
thinking it's like is this just how you

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.320
become a loser

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.880
uh i think it is you can

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:15.199
the slope to loser dome is a fast one

01:28:15.199 --> 01:28:17.040
dude yeah i think it takes as you get

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:17.760
older

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:20.320
it takes like almost just like serious

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.239
strength not to sink down in this depths

01:28:22.239 --> 01:28:23.199
of this

01:28:23.199 --> 01:28:24.960
[ __ ] pure loser this year if i didn't

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.360
dude if i didn't have stand up

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.239
i mean i'd probably be better but

01:28:30.239 --> 01:28:31.600
yeah that's the only redeeming thing i

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.360
did all year yeah

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.960
was just do stand up that's true it's

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.639
funny i'll watch stand up that i did and

01:28:36.639 --> 01:28:38.560
be like man that sucked

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.639
to watch it well sometimes i have bad

01:28:40.639 --> 01:28:42.800
sets yeah well that's like man the only

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.040
thing i do i'm a [ __ ] loser otherwise

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.040
and then just have a bad set that's what

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.719
that's what sucks about putting your

01:28:48.719 --> 01:28:50.159
chips in one basket dude because when

01:28:50.159 --> 01:28:52.159
you don't do good at that

01:28:52.159 --> 01:28:53.600
it opens up the cat they opens up the

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.199
doors dude and all the hounds coming i'm

trans to a black lady by eating

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.520
