excited to be here i i told them they

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.920

serving your beers in glass are they i

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.080
thought it was gonna be like stadium

rules plastic bottles no caps

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.520

you're doing all right i uh i quit

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.640
drinking recently and uh

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.280
yeah turns out that was not the problem

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.120
yeah

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.800
pretty frustrating place to be i really

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.480
thought once i quit drinking my lust for

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.599
booze replaced with like ambition

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.120
not the case you guys ever jerk off

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.840
because you're hungry

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.319
no food in the house

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.080
it's like i'm starving but i still want

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.640
to feel good

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.959
i'm gonna rub one out see if i can't

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.840
skip lunch

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.440
it's a pretty dark place to be

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.360
yeah i'm subverting a basic instinct

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.840
with a more basic instinct i'm tricking

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.000
my stomach into stopping screaming it's

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.280
starving by getting it to think hey

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.080
maybe we're [ __ ]

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.319
this guy's [ __ ] let's cool out a

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.319
little bit

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.400
i don't know i uh i grew up in a small

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.840
house

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.080
anyone else

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.800
three everyone else is rich

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.640
everyone else grew up in a mansion well

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.760
let me tell you when you grow up in a

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.840
small house when you jerk off you have

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.560
to do it quietly

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.920
yeah

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.519
my parents would be like what's that

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.280
creaking noise

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.599
there's only four of us that live here

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.799
three of us are in the kitchen

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.640
it's chris up in his room like if

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.760
lifting up his bed ever so slightly

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.680
over and over again

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.720
doing tiny jumping jacks

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.159
we just bought him that new computer

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.720
what could it be

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.280
what on earth could he be doing up there

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.360
no i got really into i got really into

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.519
quiet porn

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.360
that's my favorite kind of porn is like

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.040
two people [ __ ] in the changing room

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.920
for jc penney

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.319
it's like we're all in it together i'll

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.120
watch the door

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.879

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.120

so i'm in there all the time can't stop

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.240

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.160

i don't know if you've ever stared

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.960
through the glasses like a leather mask

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.840
with a dildo for a

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.479

been living

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.320
can't come up with one good reason to

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.160
buy this thing

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.840
lots of people need it it's on the other

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.600
side of the glass it's under lock and

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.520
key

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.800
it's not like a loose item or there's

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.479
like bottle of lube

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.560
or like those rubber fists

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.600
you guys

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.680

[ __ ] love those things

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.880
one time when i'm in there i just want

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.840
to see a man or a woman with gigantic

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.680
hands sadly buying the moderately sized

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.160
synthetic rubber fist

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.360
it's like all they want to do is just

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.880
put their hand inside somebody

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:21.919
the closest they're gonna get is just

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.639
holding onto this stump

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.280
trying to eke out a smile

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.280
it's rough

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.560
i don't know if you're ever in a sex

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.759
shop make sure you ask a lot of

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.039
questions because the sales staff

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.479
they're amazingly helpful they're the

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:35.520
best

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.520
i was at the i was in the front where

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.199
they keep like all the metal instruments

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.880
and everything and uh there's these thin

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.320
metal rods

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.160
and i was like looking at them like what

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.520
the [ __ ] are these for are these for

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.000
putting in your dick

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.440
that's horrible

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.800
and the guy jumped out from behind the

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.080
counter it was like no don't knock it

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.800
till you try it

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.880
just gotta put a little lube on that

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.479
thing it's like getting your dick stroke

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.280
from the inside

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.120
i know it's a pretty good pitch

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.000
this

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.759
it's a really good pitch i almost bought

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.759
it

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.039
but it's like how long's my dick gonna

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.720
last i keep shoving metal rods down it

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.080
you know

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.600
i made it for the long haul i got

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.360
fantasies

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.360
i'll miss some things

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.720
i really want to put my penis in a

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.319
girl's butt and then put it in her mouth

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.520
this is an audible oh

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.280
no i don't really want to do that i only

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.720
want to do that in the fantasy world

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.160
where she doesn't get like cholera

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.199
or dysentery or some horrible oregon

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.759
trail disease

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.199

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.400
falling ill on the oregon trail

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.840
they were going ass to mouth in the

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.919
wagon

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.319
while i was out hunting

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.319
or that guy that is a 21st century human

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.639
experience

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:06.479
you know that guy needs a whole economy

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:08.479
to get off he needs people

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:11.280
making plastic

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.319
using razors

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.360
i don't know

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.520
i uh i did some i did some kind of edgy

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.199
stuff one i peed in a girl's mouth once

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.960
how are you guys pulling back

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.720
do you guys listen to the podcast

00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:33.760
we spent the whole last podcast talking

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.680
about whether gay guys dicks are bigger

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.880
than trey guy's dicks

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.320
i bring up peeing in mouths and you're

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.839
like look

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:44.000
[ __ ] wrong with this guy it wasn't on

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.800
purpose it was an accident

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.640
it was we were 69 and it was high school

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.360
and uh yeah

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.800
69 it's a head-to-head it's a verses

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.640
you know

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.160
and normally i could hold my own

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.000
normally like we kind of come around the

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.640
same time but uh there's one sometimes i

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.800
came early

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.800
and when you come early you can either

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.680
you know

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.839
you can have to be like look i'm done

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:13.279
or

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:14.880
you can see if another one's coming

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.839
around

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:17.760
you know try to come again

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.320
and that's it's a dangerous game

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.519
it is

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:24.800
it is because you can either come again

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.640
that'd be great or sometimes you pee

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.440
yeah

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.920
and i peed

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.839
is

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:36.800
ridiculous

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.120
yeah i peed and she swallowed it

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.360
and uh

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.040
she was like oh my god did you just pee

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.800
in my mouth

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.440

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.120
every tall guy in here that's hot as

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.240
[ __ ] is uh one of matt's cousins

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.240
this is it which actually honestly that

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.920
explains like why

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.000
like matt kind of has like matt's hot

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.920
and he has very low self-esteem for a

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.680
hot guy

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.120
it's because he's been raised with all

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.480
these [ __ ] jacked adonises

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.079
these hot [ __ ] dudes coming around

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:55.839
like look at you you little short ugly

00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:58.079
[ __ ]

00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:01.200
oh matt's hot it's very accurate

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.519
i'm about to assume doggy dude

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:07.639
i know you're good

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.279
this would be a weird night huh yep

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:15.040
usually just us in a basement we can

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.800
like start and stop a hundred times yeah

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.000
yeah okay

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.519
we probably would have started over by

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:20.800
now yeah we would have like dude we

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.399
shouldn't have said gay that many times

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:26.639
also i usually like we like it's in a

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.440
basement my room which is in a basement

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.440
and then we light candles

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.839
and turn off all the

00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:35.440
lights and then i immediately take my

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.120
pants off yeah

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.120
i literally every podcast we've recorded

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.120
is me in my underwear

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.560
and uh yeah that's it but and and the

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.000
one thing it's funny about is because

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.200
normally like

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.120
there's like when we tell we say a lot

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.200
of horrible [ __ ] things

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.760
uh and like personal stories

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.200
and then you're worried about like

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.720
because you can think of somebody you

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.160
know that listens that'll probably be

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.440
offended

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.040
and then uh tonight you guys are all

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.199
here yeah

00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:04.639
so that'll be fun like i'll say

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.839
something about like coming and then

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:07.279

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.639
it

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:48.160

impersonation of muhammad ali which is

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.360

medieval

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.039

they're gay

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.880

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.840
