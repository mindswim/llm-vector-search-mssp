on that 63 car yeah this is like dude

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.380
and first of all if they're out of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.610
control the whole [ __ ] there on that

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.740
dirt every turn they make their swerving

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.090
and then they hit the straightaway and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.360
go they go so [ __ ] fast there's

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.250
nothing like Patton you dude does it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.409
take to be like it is you got to work

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.640
your way up through the dirt tracks you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.280
don't just get the NASCAR Williams Grove

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.140
is like a serious race way to let those

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.970
guys are like good I knew it I used to

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.149
why one of my roommates like was a dirt

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.890
track you only he ever took it down to

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.299
Williams Grove that's where the big boys

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.759
who's probably like on another track but

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.469
it's they're gonna have to do something

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.479
about that [ __ ] track well I mean

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.770
again a guy died last year

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.869
and then while we're there a guy got

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.569
[ __ ] I got hit by a car then this was

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.950
not this is a pedestrian this way

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.680
I think he was a pit crew guy or he was

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.780
like something he was down on the track

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.080
a car flipped over the fence and hit him

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.160
how did the driver of the flipped cars

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.580
fine

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.980
probably yeah relatively fine yes yeah

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.209
you're in those they all crash they

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.489
crash the whole time like the it's rare

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.989
that they get around like three laps

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.120
it's usually like one or two or three

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.880
laps then someone crashes then everybody

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.620
goes slow for like two laps they get the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.480
car off the track and then start flying

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.430
again do they finish the race once

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.170
somebody dies or they know everyone that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.420
they called it well that's got a sauce

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.790
also 61 was the winner was he realize

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.680
he's in first when the guy got killed

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.180
that's how they didn't race until

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.650
someone dies and then they get race

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.030
until someone dies in that guy whoever

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.100
was winning when that guy got hit you

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.190
win the race never ends it was [ __ ]

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.780
it was not Smith it was a crowd like oh

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.420
what's so loud it's so loud you couldn't

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.569
hear it cuz we were on the infield on

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.519
the other side I mean the whole thing's

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.049
like less it's like the size of a fool

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.060
how much does it take his cost 15 bucks

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.000
I mean if you think about what they're

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.970
selling dude possibility of a faces of

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.540
death video live in person you every

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.400
year you're gonna catch somebody buddy

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.579
dust I'm two for two that's a thankfully

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.590
I wasn't there when for what 35 you seen

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.390
two people died for 30 bucks yeah it's

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.220
pretty good stop bad I didn't see this

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.780
guy die though if I did that would be

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.790
pretty [ __ ] up cuz if you hit

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.590
apparently he was standing on the bed of

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.209
a truck oh and he was a 67 year old man

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.799
so he went out on his shield like he

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.359
went out dying exactly how he would have

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:49.739
wanted you went straight to Valhalla day

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.700
that's exactly what I said in the park

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.930
you were back on the on the grass

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.090
started chugging some beers for him you

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.540
had to

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.819
r.i.p damn he bitter he squirted that

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.410
[ __ ] and he did the Mad Max squirt in

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.940
his mouth dude and Steph tub was like

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.900
blop just apparently people I know knew

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.760
him yeah and they were like he was such

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.870
a [ __ ] nice dude

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.870
really he was 67 and I mean due to 67

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.549
car flipped out of a race track and

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.169
crossed him it's one way to died he's

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.000
and that good way to go he's getting

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.349
immortalized at the track he's gonna

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.030
have a memorial now what would you

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.870
rather do this late

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.389
holy [ __ ] yourself and turn like 73 or

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.530
just have that one split-second of like

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.760
Holmes I was thing about crashing the

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.040
whole time every time on a small plane

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.690
too so we were hitting lots of hard

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.850
turbulence and I was like dude that

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.160
feeling of like even when the plane dips

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.630
a little from turbulence when you fall

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.970
it's just that feeling the whole time

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.190
and then you die it's just like your

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.940
stomach's dropping your mine crash must

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.100
be you have a lot of time to think about

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.530
it yeah man you got a lot of time to be

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.479
like Oh especially when the noise kicks

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.070
in once you go no you're going down he

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.240
goes you just turbulence just turbulence

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.280
once you're here you're like oh dude

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.750
you're definitely dying all of us are

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.760
dying right now women screaming and [ __ ]

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.229
people that's what I think would bother

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.030
I mean obviously you know impending

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.740
death wouldn't be great for sure but

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.260
like the paranoia or the hysteria on the

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.360
plane just the main ammonium would just

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.190
be [ __ ] horrendous especially like

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.780
I'd be my girlfriend to be clinging to

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.970
me dying in like a panic like that yeah

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.010
in with your girlfriend we're like she's

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.950
clinging on you or even incoherent is

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.560
one second shut up we're going to die

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.060
that you want to seriously spend your

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.039
last 30 seconds like this man I don't

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.360
I'd be [ __ ] freaking out

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.130
yeah of course we had some hard turb and

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.680
I was just like we go out we go out yeah

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.820
I try to started thinking about the

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.770
podcasts I'm like if I died in a plane

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.169
on the way here probably pretty good for

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.320
the podcast I was like alright I know I

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.840
think the cast would suffer I mean we

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.060
get a nice little pop we get her in like

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.520
the daily time I got about eight I got

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.020
about eight flights this August dude

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.789
you'll leave really a decent chance I a

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.750
Big Bopper out and go down Castle live

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.699
forever though I mean if one of us bites

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.099
it in a [ __ ] airplane accident it'd

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:15.690
be tight if the airplane I start I was

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.729
reading the the Atlantic well I was

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.199
flying and there was an article I wanted

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:20.400
to read about like the disappearance of

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.389
the Malaysian airliner

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.400
yeah I got like three words into him

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.690
like I'm [ __ ] reading this [ __ ] right

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.300
now I think about sexual harassment like

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.380
I'm not reading this yeah I was watching

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.810
a movie an in-flight movie I forget

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.400
which one it was but there was a plane

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.590
crash in it and like so it's on my

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.210
screen up and I'm like looking around

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.680
like people probably think I'm a [ __ ]

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.320
[ __ ] just sitting on a flight

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.219
watching plane

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.840
making you have

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.949
in my row watch a plane dude think about

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.010
that big I [ __ ] died while I was out

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.900
there boozing dude yeah how would that

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.280
everyone's shuffle out there like yeah

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.720
everyone silent people were like crying

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.960
and [ __ ] yeah I mean a guy died it was

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.320
uh area and a hole in front of a whole

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.290
[ __ ] bleacher of people I got [ __ ]

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.580
squashed by a car

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.500
I mean what's what's funny to guys I uh

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.460
I was just that book I read all all

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.020
things shining or all the shiny things I

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.639
think the dude who told me to check it

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:16.780
out was big Dan dude from I think

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.090
Louisville okay he uh I gave a shout out

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.770
but they're talking about how that's

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.840
like our last venue left for people to

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.820
find meaning and like watching like

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.560
sports or things you're watching someone

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.820

like the idea behind Moby Dick was like

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.720
they think Melville was getting at this

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.850
thing we're like the best you can do is

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.710

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.590
like live on the surface of it like

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.180
whatever this shit's weird if you try to

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.470

I was in the hotel at the [ __ ]

00:13:22.619 --> 00:13:24.759
reception at a table of people that I

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:27.129

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:35.769
pretty any time I was like if I swore

00:13:35.769 --> 00:13:37.629
some [ __ ] like that they were like well

00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:39.220

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.649
like fully so they did the chicken dance

00:13:41.649 --> 00:13:43.059
was the funniest [ __ ] thing in the

00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:44.350
world I was at it I was sitting at a

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.699
table with black people watching the

00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:46.929
white people watching white people do a

00:13:46.929 --> 00:13:48.369
chicken dance and they were sincerely

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.619

and it do die it's like through no fault

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:08.019
of any ones I don't think it devolves

00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:10.509
into a dance-off every single time it

00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:12.279
everyone nobody dances everyone gets in

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:14.619
a circle and they just like will just

00:14:14.619 --> 00:14:16.509
like watch people dance and it gets into

00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:18.339
this like hyper charged environment of

00:14:18.339 --> 00:14:20.139
like everyone's like it's like

00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:22.059
competitive at some point so dude it C

00:14:22.059 --> 00:14:23.910

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:31.029
other layer on top of everything here

00:14:31.029 --> 00:14:36.279
I'm definitely the highest person so so

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:37.660
I'm like I'm gonna guess I'm like I'm

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.889
gonna be called down to the dance floor

00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:40.449
with Brittany I'm like this sucks unless

00:14:40.449 --> 00:14:42.100
all my chugging red wine I'm drinking

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.689
around I'm trying to break the mental

00:14:43.689 --> 00:14:45.279
barrier of just being like whatever I'm

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:46.899
not even to think about this which

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:48.339
apparently was impossible so I started

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:49.749
taking my vape pen like I was hitting my

00:14:49.749 --> 00:14:51.879
vape pen like okay like I was smoking I

00:14:51.879 --> 00:14:53.199
was literally trying to escape those

00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:54.669
trying to smoke like my vape pen like it

00:14:54.669 --> 00:14:57.309
was DMT I was like I was outside is

00:14:57.309 --> 00:14:59.379
ripping this thing finally it all caught

00:14:59.379 --> 00:15:01.540
up with me and her grandma was serious

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.519

00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:32.769
to dance like a table of people who are

00:15:32.769 --> 00:15:34.070
just watching me laughing and

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.780

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.580
[ __ ] after that dude got crushed I

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.800

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.330
only way you knew how I chipped my tooth

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.840
tooth oh yeah it was a fun night but so

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.370
you jarred this lady shook her around

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.220
shook her around you know it's a weird

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.510
thing I was like getting yelled at by

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.860
Brittany because you're being too rough

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.630
I mean I'm hold her up she's gonna fall

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.730
over I'm like she's looking at my face

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.830
like how high are you don't even know I

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.510
we were talking about I literally

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.120
couldn't move my face couldn't make a

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.680
facial expression other than just like

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.030
being awestruck just being like oh so

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.650
then but yeah then I just watched the

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.770
whole time it was just this like like

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.150
her cousin was DJing her cousin did a

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.200
really good job explaining all these

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.100
really good songs but they had a

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.870
preordained a list that she had to play

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.270
certain songs like dude it was it was if

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.340
I was watching this being like damn dude

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.530
this is very like like a sociological

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.150
study it's think black people start

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.189
dancing like having a good time and like

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:05.420
white people will come out in a pack and

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.160
like they at one point they didn't

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.920
organize like practice dance number

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.180
together which I'm like it's kind what

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.060
the groomsmen yeah all them they didn't

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.530
organize the all like dude it was like

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.630
14 people yeah they all they all goes I

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.860
think almost like a cult they're all in

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.870
this church on time to like put together

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.630
a four-minute dance number and then it's

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.520
like you're watching like white dudes

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.530
who I I can only maybe I'm projecting

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.270
this on them but I think or maybe a

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.370
little on edge about like dancing in

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.050
front of black people but I'm I'm

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.700
slightly nervous too I mean I obviously

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.740
I'm over now I [ __ ] you know it was

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.330
fun but I feel like you because you are

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.010
getting judged I'm at the table watching

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.510
them watch white people dance and I'm

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.010
like laughing it's hilarious to watch

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.230

I don't know white people lost the

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.370
ability this bothers me I have a very

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.540
Apollonian temperament dude I'm like a

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.450
big world world joiner I can't help with

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.410
happened to white people dude why can't

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.700

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.809
were watching that brownie thing I was

00:18:05.809 --> 00:18:07.520

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.080
watching it well white people dance in

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.540
15 second bursts you like dance for two

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.280
seconds and you go you like look at your

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.840
friend in the eye like haha you laugh

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.179
and then jump back into it but it was

00:18:20.179 --> 00:18:21.860
something very Viking like okay like

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.809
white people would have descend on the

00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:25.790
dance floor and start like [ __ ]

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.370
moving and these really short hard like

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.290
stiff powerful movements that I was like

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.000
I'm watching like dude this is kind of

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.710
like weird and they kind of intimidating

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:35.570
circus they were researchers they don't

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.309
desert me and then you'd watch like and

00:18:37.309 --> 00:18:38.450
then the black dudes would go out and

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.380
you know the black lady or whatever

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.750
they'd all go out and start dancing it

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.610
was like like one to her one cause and

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.960
went out and danced like they kept doing

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.730
that circle [ __ ] where they like circle

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:47.840
them do like the Soul Train line I'm

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.700
like this is crazy but he like [ __ ]

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.990
killed it's like a straight minute and a

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.880
half and you could tell they killed the

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.120
morale in the dance floor everyone kinda

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.830
stopped it was just like and they hit

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.630
the chicken dance dude and it was over

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.970
that state of Texas came and wrapped the

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.710
chicken - a convincing item I was

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.230
getting elbows from 360 degrees big man

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.490

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.660
what your people do and I'm gonna doing

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.460
the chicken dance pretty much nobody

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.010
feels it I'll start standing in it

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.330
dude they were like the people were

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.190
genuinely like upset watching white

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.420
people do the chicken dance being like

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.710
what that is an off-putting someone do

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.240
the chicken is like alright we these

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.540

if your groomsmen do a dance or I mean

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.470
bridesmaids I'll forgive because women

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.260

visibly visibly when I mean you guys are

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.299

00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:52.960

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:08.740
like she definitely looked at you it was

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.559
like the [ __ ] here we go yeah food was

00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:12.789
that we won in that waitress was really

00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:14.019
nice but everyone in there was on

00:25:14.019 --> 00:25:16.360
eggshells dude it was bizarre I was like

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.409
damn dude there are a lot of black

00:25:17.409 --> 00:25:18.880
people in that town though there are

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.010
yeah there are so I mean but they keep

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.380
it I think they keep it segregated kinda

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.299
yeah I mean well that was the other

00:25:25.299 --> 00:25:26.679
thing too when I was at the wedding

00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:29.830
I was watching uh there was like such an

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.130
effort to like I don't know man to like

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.039
kind of try to like D racialize the

00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:37.240
situation like I was watching people

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.889
talk to each other and especially like I

00:25:38.889 --> 00:25:40.510
feel like white people want to not be

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.850
racist it's just like yeah if you try to

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.519
like engage other people you just come

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:47.529
off as really weird as a replacement so

00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:48.850
it's like I was watching the guy being

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.889
like couldn't been a better family to

00:25:50.889 --> 00:25:52.539
join in this is just the best and it's

00:25:52.539 --> 00:25:54.580
like so I'm like wow there's some better

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.279
families yeah there's like but it's all

00:25:57.279 --> 00:25:58.720
wait did they separate the tables

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.580
because the tables had to be mostly

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.850
black most look like a checkerboard now

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.490
I know why they did this yeah they did

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:07.539
it assigned seating

00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:08.860
cuz Britney's like why don't the [ __ ]

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.000
when they sign C they should have

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.429
assigned seating all dudes if you leave

00:26:12.429 --> 00:26:14.529
it up to the people typically it gets

00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:17.019
segregated I mean obviously did yeah but

00:26:17.019 --> 00:26:20.820
oh tecnique not me I was [ __ ]

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.429
yourself yeah don't you pat yourself on

00:26:24.429 --> 00:26:27.639
the back a little more dude it was uh it

00:26:27.639 --> 00:26:29.440
was it was interesting on so many levels

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.450
dude I was like the religious level

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.070
there's a weird racial level and then

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.070
there's like everything like normal [ __ ]

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.820
like you know when you're there and

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.230
there's another family at a wedding like

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.390
obviously like his family [ __ ] sucks

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:41.530
you know instantly kind of hate them

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.000
like what a bunch of [ __ ] losers why

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.430
why did they suck I'm it I'm saying

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:46.690
whenever I go to a wedding for I found

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.370
out but in this particular time did you

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.420
see a family that sucked

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.980
no but there's always a tension so that

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.660
was like between the two fee yeah there

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.520
was like that tension became all it was

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.800
also I think our my family the Gillis's

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.960
are the family that sucks really cuz I

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.400
don't think we ever there's never that

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.630
it's always just like let's see who can

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:02.890
get the most [ __ ] up yeah but it's

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:04.120
also you're looking at the other fan

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.430
like what a bunch of [ __ ] I yeah but

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.400

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.170
not that's my family is the same thing

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:16.780

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.369
like right we are there any shortcuts

00:38:14.369 --> 00:38:18.300
this is [ __ ] sick so you sure that's

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.550
what that guy try to take each other

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:21.720
tried to hit the jump and someone put a

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.790
banana some what a fake rocks do you

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:27.660
what do you think about all the deaths

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.970
right now the shooting oh man

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.450
you think they're for real yeah yeah I

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:34.920
think they're real you think I think

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.810
saying otherwise is not a good look for

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.990
us not at all yeah it's just a lot why I

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:41.970
want to know when did this start dude

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:45.060
shootings we've we've been had guns I'm

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.859
not turning this an anti take away gun

00:38:46.859 --> 00:38:49.140
argument but I think we had guns dude

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.619
when I think in Oh for an assault rifle

00:38:52.619 --> 00:38:55.950
ban got lifted in the United States

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:59.130
really I think and people started

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:01.470
shooting and then why wouldn't people

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:02.880
have been like going in with like

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.319
muskets and [ __ ] lightened up the

00:39:04.319 --> 00:39:06.240
town like when did this when do this

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:06.839
starts

00:39:06.839 --> 00:39:08.819
I believe it's pharmaceuticals you

00:39:08.819 --> 00:39:10.170
thought so I think so too I think

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:14.400
without a doubt that's a [ __ ] yeah cuz

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.170
it's like there happened now they're

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.000
like one a week once or all kiwis that

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.530
were they're all like dudes that were

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.230
you know 90s kids that were given

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:25.319
ritalin [ __ ] their whole lives [ __ ]

00:39:25.319 --> 00:39:26.790
your brain chemistry oh yeah

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.349
taking always like antidepressants

00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:30.540
anti-anxiety things well who's on the

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.480
books making people like Isis liver

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.000
people more suicidal yeah so it's like

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.190
if and that's been established like

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.150
you're saying there's no link between

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:41.400
like homicide allottee what sucks about

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.819
it is even having that discussion people

00:39:44.819 --> 00:39:46.530
are like you're making an excuse for

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:48.990
white men like terrorism it's and it's

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.390
like dude we're not making an excuse for

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.040
it it's just let's let's figure out why

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.869
unless you believe the answer is that

00:39:54.869 --> 00:39:57.089
white men are inherently evil then in

00:39:57.089 --> 00:39:58.829
that case we can stop searching for a

00:39:58.829 --> 00:40:00.270
problem well there's no there's people

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:01.530
who are saying it's literally Trump

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:02.490
Trump

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:05.580
has like emboldened there's like dormant

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.740
shooters who like I need to go to the

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.720
mall and light people up but like Trump

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.940
finally came and they're like now I go

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.860
now it's time yeah well that's what the

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.860
Sandy Hook guy said he said he loved The

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.470
Apprentice he was a big Trump guy even

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.950
back then

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.840
Sandy Hook Sandy Hook was like in his

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:22.920
manifesto he was like The Apprentice

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.580
[ __ ] rules what about what about the

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:27.260
okay

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.810
trying to prove that they preceded Trump

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:34.260
daddy yeah it's true a second I was like

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.730
I mean I guess these guys probably write

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:36.990
some wild yeah well it's weird

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:41.340
I bet Trump doesn't help I don't know

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.930
because I don't I'm just trying to

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:45.360
figure out like when do these dudes

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.740
start do it like this if this was just

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.590
like an organic response to just like

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:51.869
some sort of political ideology it's

00:40:51.869 --> 00:40:54.180
just it's weird that's where everyone

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.460
says they're like this is terrorism he's

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.750
not calling a terrorism and it's like

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:59.070
whatever yeah sure you call terrorism

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.470
but like dude yeah was is there a

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:02.940
collective cause and are all these

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:07.170
shooters citing a similar thing that's

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:08.880
that's I think a lot of them are are

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.470
being like took a lot of them are like

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:13.410
4chan type really yeah Alaska I'm in

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:14.970
Christchurch and then this El Paso guy

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:18.720
both of those two she fired up on some

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.880
4chan they were on that [ __ ] there on

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.710
that billion spud tip well being a girl

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:24.330
be any conspiracy theorist now is

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:27.750
recognized as being a FBI like terror

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.040
attack a terrorist gang if you identify

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.900
is like if you like start talking Q

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.200
there they basically put a thing in

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.520
basically they're gonna treat that like

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.210
I'm like being like Isis [ __ ] rules

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:43.800
well if people from Q and all that [ __ ]

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.240
are queuing on and like all that [ __ ]

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.760
are shooting up places I think they

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.580
should look into it yeah but keep an eye

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.320
on those [ __ ] chat boards but if ever

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.150
in q and ons like do this is a clear

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:56.700
[ __ ] conspiracy there's no there's no

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.020
one they're not telling it you know

00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.190
they're the last thing they're doing is

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:00.450
telling people to go shoot people up

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.160
there like they keep setting up mass

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.080
shootings so the last thing a hardcore

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.820
conspiracy theorist q and on is gonna do

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.640
you just gonna verify the government

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.590
narrative that like crazed white

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:12.720
supremacists are shooting people up yeah

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.490
but I think crazy white supremacist are

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.079
shooting do you think there's lurkers or

00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:20.849
the queue thing her dislike sorry guys I

00:42:20.849 --> 00:42:22.410

well yeah the protest against the

00:43:12.509 --> 00:43:13.049
government

00:43:22.049 --> 00:43:23.339
give a [ __ ] that's one brand of

00:43:23.339 --> 00:43:25.229
terrorism being like hey guys Robin Hood

00:43:25.229 --> 00:43:26.729
terrorism the hey guys don't be in this

00:43:26.729 --> 00:43:28.289
building I won't blow the [ __ ] up little

00:43:28.289 --> 00:43:30.209
Robin do you think McVeigh was more of a

00:43:30.209 --> 00:43:31.739
Robin Hood you tell people to get out

00:43:31.739 --> 00:43:34.199
that's the Lisa Kudrow daycare did he

00:43:34.199 --> 00:43:36.140
yeah who'd even tell him to get out

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.390
maybe the boys didn't get that memo like

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:41.369
hey kids yeah you blow up a daycare so

00:43:41.369 --> 00:43:43.469
who did he tell to leave I don't know ok

00:43:43.469 --> 00:43:45.599
so he's a bad boy yeah I didn't know

00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:48.089
that yeah yeah it's pretty bad pull up a

00:43:48.089 --> 00:43:51.809
[ __ ] daycare yeah yeah and these guys

00:43:51.809 --> 00:43:54.539
shooting this thing up even if they're

00:43:54.539 --> 00:43:57.630
on yeah you gotta look into it I'm not

00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:59.999
saying [ __ ] bog everybody that's on

00:43:59.999 --> 00:44:01.680
[ __ ] and not like looking up

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.660
conspiracy theories cuz it's fun yeah

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.089
cuz there's kind of fun some of them are

00:44:06.089 --> 00:44:07.979
true that's other so I'm worried yeah

00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:09.509
but the whole you know what it is weird

00:44:09.509 --> 00:44:12.630
I will say this Billy this is [ __ ]

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:15.539
weird yeah Billy called me I probably

00:44:15.539 --> 00:44:17.309
called him but we were talking and he

00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:19.589
was like the tape of the Clintons is

00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:21.569
gonna surface anytime something bad

00:44:21.569 --> 00:44:22.949
happens to the Clintons there's a

00:44:22.949 --> 00:44:24.869
shooting before it he told me that like

00:44:24.869 --> 00:44:28.920
three days ago yeah yeah so that was a

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.030
little like Oh

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.850
Billy's on to something here but I don't

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:34.140
think that has anything to do with it

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.720
I think there's a real [ __ ] issue

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.370
with dudes I think it's pharmaceuticals

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:40.920
again and I think the reason it's mostly

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.590
white guys is because they're usually

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.690
the ones with access to like you know

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:47.580
they're from suburban homes that they

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.230
were taken to the doctor as a young kid

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:50.640
because they had mental they're probably

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.260
like [ __ ] in school mm-hmm so they

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.180
got loaded up with pills yeah I think

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.280
that's why it's a white guy issue true

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.900
cuz were the only ones [ __ ] injecting

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.610
our kids with so much [ __ ] not true now

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.410
they're not true exactly that's why I

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:04.650
pumping Y years ago I prophesied that

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:05.700
there would be some black shooters

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.680
headed through the pipes yeah although

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.060
there were three black shooters in

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.190
Harrisburg what no one's chatting about

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.220
oh that's yeah yeah they're more yeah

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.060
that was just kind of running and

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.710
gunning that was just classic as it's

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:17.820
running that's just a different type of

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.110
[ __ ] you know don't even get me started

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:21.780
on do two different uh people do

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:22.980
separate that they're like it's not an

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.390
act of terror this is an active and it's

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:27.300
like yeah it's pretty [ __ ] either way

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.560
I hear you but but I was watching

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.420
[ __ ] CNN about it and they were just

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.960
like will Donald Trump call it white

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.820
terrorism it's like dude shut up yeah

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.800
are you guys making this Democrats

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.320
Republicans both sides it's [ __ ] down

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.630
that's my problem I always do that

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.160
that's that and this is where this is my

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.410
beef this is this is my little stake in

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:49.080
the sand it's like why are we examining

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.370
this to a political lens we should be

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:52.410
like oh hey we have people at more and

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:54.420
more yeah who are freaking the [ __ ] out

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.950
to the point where they're just shooting

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:58.350
at malls and it's just we're just like

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:00.150
ah [ __ ] like another one happens and

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:03.900
it's like damn GOP it's [ __ ] crazy

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.330
dude think I damnit my political enemies

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.730
keep doing this yeah it's [ __ ]

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.430
bizarre man that does like free that's

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:12.660
the thing that freaks me out about it

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.760
I'm like this this is your guys content

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.290
point if this is your beef being like

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:18.810
yeah you know the fact that I mean it's

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:19.950
one thing if people are coming and

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:22.740
shooting up the mall with like I don't

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:23.880
know I mean I guess some of them haven't

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.350
clear agenda so what was the DC sniper

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.770
on I don't know exactly a lot of you and

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:30.120
a lot of these dudes to me at least I

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.380
don't I don't dig in I'm gonna start

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:33.300
digging into these actually but a lot of

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.980
them to me are just like dude you just

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.720
[ __ ] shoot and stuff up I don't I

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.920
don't get my hands on them that's kind

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.470
of what the CNN thing was interesting

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:42.310
because there was an author that wrote

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:44.530
Columbine a book about Columbine and

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:47.349
then a book about parkland and he was

00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:49.000
like on air he was like these guys are

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.090
just dip shits it's like they're not

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:54.430
writing political manifestos yeah

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:56.619
scribbling down gibberish and then

00:46:56.619 --> 00:46:57.609
shooting things up

00:46:57.609 --> 00:46:59.710
there's no while everyone was like this

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:01.630
is if these were Muslims we'd be calling

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:02.859
it terrors it's like shut up

00:47:02.859 --> 00:47:05.800
that's need to make it racist now yeah

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.840
if it's already a [ __ ] horrific I

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.980
don't know I mean obviously there's

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.410
truth to that but shut up no I said it

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:13.210
once let's not spend a whole weapon they

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:15.160
did call McVeigh domestic terrorist yeah

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.810
so or that would be that's the inverse

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:22.570
logic though of being like like I shot

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:24.220
people obviously terrorism is like well

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:25.570
you got to give it a second like even

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:27.670
[ __ ] the Saudi Arabian dude shoots

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:29.140
people you give back terrorists it's

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.670
like actually he wasn't you're like [ __ ]

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:33.040
sorry yeah so you know whatever but

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.290
either way that was to me I'm like dude

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:37.780
I need to know what I would love to like

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.990
follow the lineage of mass shooters yeah

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:42.849
cuz I I it's like dude guns have been

00:47:42.849 --> 00:47:44.650
around like I don't have you I would

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:45.700
love to know if that happens in history

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.500
or dudes just started like rolling

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.450
around or like boom boom boom boom I

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.190
guess every now and again someone you

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:52.630
get a sick dog he'll go through like a

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:54.490
wild west town have to be put down

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.580
yeah you get like the belltower guy in

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.580
Texas that was in like the 60s 70s he

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.140
went he won him yeah went a little wild

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.940
Danny really got from the bell tower at

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:05.980
the University sorry sniping people

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.950
started wrecking people okay what was

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:10.990
his deal I think he got hit in the head

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.359
a lot he was yeah I think he had PTSD

00:48:13.359 --> 00:48:17.080
okay who's a wild boy there's a lot of

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:20.200
those I mean that's kind of there was

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.270
two this weekend yeah there's a lot on

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:26.020
my head mmm I think 30 net 42 people got

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.780
killed this weekend really yeah in both

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.599
shootings yeah man that's there that's

00:48:31.599 --> 00:48:32.800
where I get a little like I don't wanna

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.480
get washed by the [ __ ] FBI but I'm

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.609
like dude there was two of these this

00:48:36.609 --> 00:48:41.020
weekend and it's like I mean I I'm gonna

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.160
have to dig into it I just want to know

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.200
dude what's the source isn't like a

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.240
false flag I don't think it's false flag

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.619
thing but it's like what's the central

00:48:47.619 --> 00:48:51.160
source like is it centralized like what

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.530
is for chans ideology and what about it

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.240
would be like I'm gonna shoot people are

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:55.660
they I'm

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.900
well I so you get it it's just [ __ ]

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.310
people latching onto something it's a

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:01.990
lot like terrorism yeah it's like

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:05.110
[ __ ] guys latch on to Islam and then

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:06.310
they're like all I need to do this you

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.630
know a lot of again a lot of the 14

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.360
people are super like considering and

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.740
[ __ ] around and they can spirit a lot

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.210
of the conspiracy theorists and [ __ ] but

00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:15.400
then guys are like yeah here's my

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.080
manifesto if I kill a bunch of people

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.310
they're gonna see it now I'm gonna you

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:21.280
know I have to go on yeah I guess so I'm

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.710
yeah I have to put a pause on that cuz I

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:24.160
don't know

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.600
I don't not gonna say it's total

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.330
conspiracy theory but it's like dude

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:30.250
look man they're making it so if you

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.170
even think about something like that

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:33.820
you're all you're all of a sudden

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.460
shunned that's what I don't like to be

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.720
like there's gonna be a building thing

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.220
where people who question the operation

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.510
of the government are terrorists it's

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:41.590
like yeah that's insane

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:43.690
yeah I see that I'm like well you can't

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:44.890
just you can't just call it that because

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:46.450
then it's like now it's free season

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.120
there yeah well there I think there's a

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.380
glaring difference between question in

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.740
the operation of the government and

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.860
these conspiracy theories that are like

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:59.160
Obama had children in the White House

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.020
you know yeah yeah for sure I think

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.190
that's where it gets a little Clinton

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:04.720
cut off a mask and put on it but that

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.160
was dude I've read an article about how

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.740
now we're like people are so afraid of

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.260
getting like manipulated by the

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.820
government and now like we're up to like

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:14.200
make our own narratives up with the

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.670
internet like all the different topics

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:34.480
right now where it's like people are

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.070

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:11.499
privilege point of personal privilege

00:51:11.499 --> 00:51:14.170
could you please stop using pronouns or

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.710
gender specific pronouns please the

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:22.599
whole like dude it is nuts yeah that's

00:51:22.599 --> 00:51:24.130

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.920
watch that that's a whole thing we're

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.900
like you have to have some sort of

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:33.700
affliction or even perceived deflection

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.499
through race in order for your words to

00:51:35.499 --> 00:51:36.940
mean anything so like the meaning of

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.200
what you say doesn't mean anything

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.729
otherwise what how you present yourself

00:51:39.729 --> 00:51:41.920
and like the more you could I'd tap into

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.569
a victim thing people were like well

00:51:43.569 --> 00:51:44.950
that's right the way they were all

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:46.839
raising their hands was by screaming

00:51:46.839 --> 00:51:50.229
point of personal privilege what's that

00:51:50.229 --> 00:51:51.970
I have no [ __ ] idea what that was and

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:53.400
they're like okay comrade go ahead

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:57.160
there's a I could you please stop using

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:01.390
gender specific pronouns please yes yes

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:03.160
they'll wave their hands and [ __ ] so

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.529
this is what and this is my beer my beef

00:52:05.529 --> 00:52:09.130
isn't to you know be like obviously I

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:11.140
dude I'm watching people so drowned in

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.729
propaganda that it just gets worse and

00:52:12.729 --> 00:52:14.019
worse yeah I was like more and more

00:52:14.019 --> 00:52:16.299
shootings but again it's like and this

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:17.799
is the anger this is where you're I'm

00:52:17.799 --> 00:52:20.140
teetering on the deep end but it's like

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.450
do I think the United States the

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:24.489
mechanism it is would ever stage a

00:52:24.489 --> 00:52:26.769
shooting do I think the people could do

00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:28.599
that it's like I mean dude the

00:52:28.599 --> 00:52:30.940
assassinated JFK and like that's pretty

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:32.769
well known that they did that so it's

00:52:32.769 --> 00:52:34.420
like I don't know dude it depends on how

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:36.279
but again it's also like and watch the

00:52:36.279 --> 00:52:38.710
politicians and the debates I'm like

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:40.630
these are just dude that's they're not

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:42.160
that smart like it think that they're

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.599
putting together like that yeah

00:52:43.599 --> 00:52:45.400
then again if they've had hundreds of

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.140
years of put it together it's like it's

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:49.989
like who knows who knows but I think you

00:52:49.989 --> 00:52:52.150
know these people they're not did that

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:54.150
wasn't the government didn't set that up

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.769
no I don't I think people are now really

00:52:56.769 --> 00:52:58.479
losing their minds and going off but

00:52:58.479 --> 00:53:00.759
again it's like maybe they throw one in

00:53:00.759 --> 00:53:02.200
I don't know dude how did you know and I

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.880
mean who the [ __ ] knows I don't think

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.069
yeah I think it's very you're not

00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:07.660
allowed to think that anymore you must

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.160
say that's why even if you were allowed

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.900
it for sure very safe to say that these

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:13.269
these for sure it is for sure safe to

00:53:13.269 --> 00:53:15.640
say yeah definitely safe what would they

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.170
have to gain by this taking people's

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:18.940
guns away yeah it's like

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:20.289
it's like I think they would come up

00:53:20.289 --> 00:53:22.869
with a new plan they've tried school

00:53:22.869 --> 00:53:25.780
shooting in public shooting uh 238 times

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:27.369
this year true and it still hasn't

00:53:27.369 --> 00:53:29.319
worked true I guess people didn't come

00:53:29.319 --> 00:53:30.430
up with that would be kind of annoying

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:31.960
if you're like dude I got a swine

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.670
awesome plan bro the public's can be

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:35.260
outraged we're gonna shoot 30

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.869
kindergarteners don't tell anyone but

00:53:37.869 --> 00:53:41.770
we're doing that Alex people believe

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:43.539
Alex Jones you're like [ __ ] yeah

00:53:43.539 --> 00:53:45.099
everyone's like they're not touching my

00:53:45.099 --> 00:53:45.460
guns

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:52.930
I knew I was evil that's gotta be

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:55.210
infuriating like dude please the guy's

00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:56.980
like please I cannot stage another

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.390
school shooting like shut up

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:00.789
yeah the folks are at stake and the 911

00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:03.369
the guys who you know just put together

00:54:03.369 --> 00:54:05.619
911 they didn't need to do that they

00:54:05.619 --> 00:54:06.549
could've just been like yo we're

00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:09.490
invading Iraq [ __ ] yeah everyone be like

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:12.099
hell yeah no people are way against it

00:54:12.099 --> 00:54:14.589
they were like no way evading Iraq yeah

00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:15.970
people did not they were trying to go

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:17.230
over there forever and everyone's like

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:18.670
no we do not want to go there coming off

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:20.680
the Vietnam War so they do like George

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.329
we already did Desert Storm oh they did

00:54:22.329 --> 00:54:24.279
the Gulf War and all that's it go did

00:54:24.279 --> 00:54:26.230
that yeah but that was like that was

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:28.270
like they didn't even do anything I was

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:31.059
to come and equate the sentiment around

00:54:31.059 --> 00:54:34.029
before 9/11 was like no we do you don't

00:54:34.029 --> 00:54:35.740
want to go at all I think it was just

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.720
that Desert Storm they were just there

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.119
well that was like a fake victory yeah

00:54:40.119 --> 00:54:42.130
but no to get there everyone was like

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:44.770
you say yeah so you're wrong about I

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:46.089
don't know dude I think it was I know

00:54:46.089 --> 00:54:47.799
you are there was polls that said it was

00:54:47.799 --> 00:54:49.960
like the United States was not about

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:54.250
going over to Iraq pre 9/11 yeah there

00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:56.260
were polls that were like no I that's I

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:57.730
could have sworn they didn't want a

00:54:57.730 --> 00:54:58.779
people didn't want to go they were there

00:54:58.779 --> 00:55:00.579
like seven years before that I mean

00:55:00.579 --> 00:55:01.890
maybe they don't want to go back again

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:04.480
yeah I think just there I watch a thing

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.010
they say like the Gulf War was kind of

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:07.390
like everyone was so against going to

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:09.430
war after Vietnam they did the Gulf War

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:11.170
and that was like a fake victory that

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:13.089
got morale up again people like yeah we

00:55:13.089 --> 00:55:15.010
are the [ __ ] best I watched a

00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:16.240
documentary you know that's all I'm

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.010
going off of again could be wrong I

00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:20.260
don't know it was it like a 911 was a

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:22.180
conspiracy documentary not at all it was

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.700
just kind of was just talking about how

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.010
terrorism came about in the middlee like

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:28.990
how that like spread and they were

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:30.520
saying like people there's a lot of

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.230
people who are like did we not

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:33.700
to go over there and then I don't

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:34.570
haven't happen and pretty much

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:36.700
unanimously every oh yeah let's [ __ ]

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.830
roll yeah yeah I know you're right they

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:40.150
can just go do this well they could have

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:41.800
done what they did to get into Iraq and

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.240
just be like hey he's got weapons of

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.800
mass destruction we're gonna go kill him

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:45.850
yeah we're gonna do that they wouldn't

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:47.470
even need to tell us yeah that's the

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:48.730
other thing till the words need to fake

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:50.619
911 worst comes in word what I'm saying

00:55:50.619 --> 00:55:54.750
yeah but they sank Lusitania

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:58.690
they didn't sink it exactly I'm saying

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:01.540
they sent it out and they're like what

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:05.200
had arms on it yeah so they were trying

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.390
to sneak arms into England yeah disguise

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:10.119
with a bunch of people yeah so you're

00:56:10.119 --> 00:56:11.470
talking about a government body

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:13.690
who's gonna sacrifice civilian life well

00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:14.920
they do what I call manoeuvre I don't

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.140
think they knew the Lusitania was gonna

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.790
get hit they tried to hide those weapons

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:20.230
as like they're like this is just a

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:22.150
civilian transport still did imagine

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:24.190
imagine if you put like 10 kilos of coke

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.570
in your mom's car like dude I didn't

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:26.770
know you're gonna get pulled over I just

00:56:26.770 --> 00:56:28.780
figured you could drive it for me well I

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:31.330
bet what if your friend needed 10 kilos

00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:35.260
of coke to fight the Germans didn't

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:36.850
[ __ ] and be like alright we're in it

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:38.230
we're gonna get in you know what I mean

00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:40.060
yeah so that was like yeah then again if

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.230
you have like billions of dollars at

00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:46.210
stake you're like yeah we win dude all

00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:47.560
I'm saying like I said all I'm saying is

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.700
I don't know I'm not pretending to be

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.020
the source of like definitely that's

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:52.210
definitely that now I'm watching it like

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:54.580
dude like imagine from the time you're a

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.800
little kid the political narrative what

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.180
was going on like they wanted lower

00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.160
taxes they want to raise taxes now it's

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.390
like into this thing where it's like

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:04.210
they're a [ __ ] Nazi you worship of

00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:07.359
satanic cannibalistic cabal yes still

00:57:07.359 --> 00:57:08.770
like a bit of a fringe but like do that

00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:10.180
stuff starting to bleed into like more

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.859
and more people and it's like what I

00:57:11.859 --> 00:57:12.880
just watched that uh

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.520
that's show time to show on Roger Ailes

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.070
yeah Fox News check it out that's like

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:19.960
that's like we're all so that all this

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.340
[ __ ] how Fox News start it you're saying

00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.530
yeah all this [ __ ] about news is now

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.410
just entertainment and you need to rile

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:28.720
people up constantly to make it

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.460
watchable it's like that's where we're

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:32.980
at and it started in like 97 with like

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:35.320
Fox News yeah and shit's just spin out

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.900
of control well it's also with Q the Q

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.790
stuff is such an ease I think there are

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:41.170
people who are smart enough in

00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:44.250
Washington DC because they're polling

00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:46.510
literal like Internet

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:48.010
so they're like how do I reach you know

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:49.750
these they're like geezers are dying so

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:51.940
you constantly need to like come up with

00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:53.770
new strategy to lock people into your

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:54.250
party

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:55.780
yeah so like if they're doing the

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.520
there's like think tanks being like how

00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.050
are you gonna get 20 to 30 year old

00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:00.970
dudes to start back into the GOP like

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:03.580
this the dads or GOP people we want to

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.380
get like young white dudes in back into

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:07.350
the GOP I don't think that's hard I

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:10.600
think they use queue to do that I think

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.150
you all use an inside job now for sure

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:14.440
dude all you know I think all this stuff

00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:16.240
is political propaganda the two-party

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.830
system is the enemy that's that's my

00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:19.600
ultimate yeah that's my ultimate point

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:20.770
it always gets lost because whenever I

00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:22.450
navigate either side I get lost in the

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:24.850
[ __ ] you know whatever party I'm

00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:27.010
talking about I'm looking at the [ __ ]

00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:29.080
the two-party system is the you know the

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.940
Technotronic turtles you're walking

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:33.880
around so it's like I think Hugh is the

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.790
GOP being like all right we you know we

00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:39.010
can get like they don't trust like young

00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:40.840
23 year olds a lot of them don't trust

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.220
the media sirs there's other polls that

00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:43.990
do say like 75% of people don't believe

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:45.520
what they read in the media you're like

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.810
at least don't trust it even though my

00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:48.430
front person I talked to was like I read

00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:50.560
in the newspaper therefore it's true but

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:53.020
in order to do that they're like what if

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.580
we put it together a thing we're like

00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.170
obviously we're political insiders with

00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:58.300
a lot of power and obviously we kind of

00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:59.260
know what's gonna be in the newspaper

00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:01.150
two weeks beforehand so whatever you

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:02.500
like send little pictures out and

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.630
convince them that like we're the inside

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:06.160
track trying to save people so you have

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.170
like people saving people from Nazis and

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:10.360
you have like this inside Cairo if you

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.180
believe that there's all powerful things

00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:15.130
out there not a single thing is gonna be

00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:16.870
a conspiracy not out not all pair of it

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:20.230
every single thing like now cues in on

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:23.170
cue is some form of conspiracy like

00:59:23.170 --> 00:59:25.320
they've had they've sent pictures of

00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.300
people months before a person got

00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.860
arrested so I think there's people who

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.720
know people in the meat and it's this is

00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.460
a novena conspirator conspiracy the real

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:35.800
conspiracy is that it's like a [ __ ]

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.080
military cue who's about to arrest

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.910
Hillary Clinton for like eating kids

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:41.920
this is saying is just talking about no

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:43.330
I know what you're saying but if the

00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:44.830
people pushing all that crazy [ __ ]

00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:47.020
haven't they're getting like pictures of

00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:48.370
people like of like prominent political

00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:50.020
figures getting on a private flight so

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.160
it's like where are you getting those

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:53.350
pictures from so again I think this

00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:54.680
could be a

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.740
a way to kind of steer voters in to just

00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.450
like come up with this wild ooh that's a

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:02.090
wild [ __ ] thing that there's like a

01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:03.890
secret online person who's dropping

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:05.570
breadcrumbs of people and then like yeah

01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:08.240
well it's that it doesn't he get stuff

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.340
wrong constantly sometimes but like even

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.650
to get those pictures I don't know about

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:13.910
the pictures there's like there's

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:14.960
something again you have to get into it

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.250
but it it is a bit like you're saying

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.810
there's so many things and it's a bit

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.730
horoscope cool that you can kind of like

01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:21.650
analyze it but there if you look into it

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:23.600
you will find people who think well this

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.890
thing happened and this was like two

01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:26.540
days before so some of them line up a

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.890
little and like you said not saying the

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:28.760
person's right all the time

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.410
and if it's like if it was spot-on every

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:32.600
single time it would get blown they the

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.970
other party but who the [ __ ] is dishing

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:36.860
out the goods do this is too much you'll

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.570
get [ __ ] for espionage so you think

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:39.470
he's getting it wrong on purpose

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:41.420
sometimes keep the heat off I don't know

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.830
I don't it could this could be a team

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:45.200
dude of literal people trying to steer

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.880
people over just to get people to vote

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.980
Republican yes so there's a lot of money

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.090
there's billions of dollars at stake

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:51.440
that's the other thing too okay and

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.990
these are built like dude if you

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:56.000
navigate any sort of like help system

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.740
phone system any company they're set up

01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:59.060
in a way that's like clearly run by

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.680
sociopaths so like they try to [ __ ] you

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.180
out of insurance I'll try to [ __ ] you

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.320
out of like your life insurance like

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.300
that's built into the business so the

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.920
political machine that's beholden to

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.470
those that business it's somehow people

01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:12.080
like I was hanging in a coffee shop and

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.060
I want these boys I was down there it's

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.790
like I don't know I I'm I just seem like

01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:18.830
I think it's somewhere between all of it

01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:19.730
I think there's some people who are

01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:21.530
doing a couple people pull little capers

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:23.210
here and there there's a bunch of people

01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:24.170
who are idiots and they [ __ ] just

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:25.730
unfolds but there are people I think you

01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:28.220
were like not successfully all the time

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.690
like people say but there's there's

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:31.070
stuff happening that I think is like

01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:33.290
totally kind of a scam and I think queue

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.660
is a way to get people to vote it was it

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.340
was a way to pull young voters back into

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:41.000
the - so you think the GOP backed queue

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.790
yes they start they were like hey how

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:45.440
can we reach these kids let's create a

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.140
conspiracy theory board yes okay it's

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.310
possible I think they'd I think they

01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:50.900
looked at like Internet metadata and

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:52.790
like well they don't believe any of the

01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:54.200
[ __ ] in newspapers but know what they do

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.930
believe conspiracy theories which is

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:58.040
funny because that's kind of what

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.740
happened to like Alex Jones where he was

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.240
like a conspiracy theory guy and then

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.830
they were like he's controlled by the

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:04.490
CIA

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:06.890
oh yeah they say he's well Trump talks

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.570
Alex Jones Trump's been like

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:11.210
show your gray he was yeah any guys not

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:13.310
talking I think he cut ties yeah I think

01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:15.020
he'd I think he complimented them post

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:18.230
sandy hook though he did is that you

01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:19.400
talked to him during the away whatever

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.050
what you're doing supported he was

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:22.400
talking to him like during the election

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.440
which was way after he claims Sandy Hook

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.960
was fake yes I'm saying yeah so but he

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.400
could always be I didn't know I knew the

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.080
people Sandy Hook great people yeah

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.930
sorry but it's funny that all these like

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:35.000
conspiracy boards or like conspiracy

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.190
people end up be one I mean dude

01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:38.600
everyone that reads it or listen to it

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.090
is like wait you're a conspiracy oh

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.070
they're all she'll Alex Jones the shill

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:44.390
for the Zionists they all that's like

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:46.400
the ultimate within the Constructors

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.070
user show a lot of people's I think I

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:50.810
think you a show there's people calling

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.190
this out way back when I know it's just

01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:53.750
funny that no matter what if you're a

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.910
conspiracy theory person if you write

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:57.530
conspiracy what is the opposite though

01:02:57.530 --> 01:03:01.190
you're gonna be being accused of being a

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:02.960
conspiracy yourself for sure for sure

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.940
funny but what is the opposite being

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.400
like we live in an ordered society where

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.540
like these are just people they're

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:10.340
setting it up and everything's operating

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.200
within the bounds of a like there's no

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.700
that's the opposite the I'm sort of

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.470
Hillary Clinton cutting a nine year olds

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:16.820
face off and wearing it isn't

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.890
everything's working is exactly how it

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:20.450
should know but a lot of people who so a

01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:21.950
lot of people those really obviously

01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:23.390
yeah that sounds crazy but if you even

01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:25.070
question a little bit of stuff they just

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:26.240
shut that down because they don't want

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.250
to be ally allied with conspiracy theory

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.600
whatsoever so they're like that's all

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.490
ridiculous that's my that's my whole

01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:33.530
point where it's like yeah that shit's

01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:35.030
there's a wild [ __ ] in there and if

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:36.020
you're you know if you're walking around

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.580
like crossing your fingers like here it

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:38.900
comes it's like dude don't hold your

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.700
breath yeah and also if you're a kid

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.740
who's by yourself all the time you're

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:43.990
you're on a ton of [ __ ]

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:46.010
antidepressants or anti-anxiety things

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:47.360
and you're on a message board every

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.130
night that's like the reptiles are

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:52.850
taking over you know you get an ar-15

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:55.370
and go to Walmart that's true it's wild

01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:56.510
yeah I mean that's there's a whole other

01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:59.090
sub world of that guy's life what's got

01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:00.410
what else is going on in that world but

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:01.880
it's also like dude when you're watching

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.010
your youtubes and all your political

01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:06.620
informations coming from like one-second

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:08.150
clips of the person owning the other

01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:09.680
person you're just like yes they're

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.320
right again yes yes yes and you're just

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.300
watching this being like [ __ ] yet you

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.650
will get pissed off some people get

01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:17.360
really pissed when they watch that so I

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.190
don't think it's as conspiratorial as it

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:21.290
is just totally profit-driven like

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:22.580
that's the auger

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.620
people keep watching it so we sure for

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:26.750
sure for sure I can't think it says evil

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:30.110
force you know Netflix is Netflix is

01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:32.750
questionable yeah but I bet they're the

01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:34.460
numbers is all they're after

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.190
true so like maybe if it starts to fail

01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:39.050
they'll stop putting liberal [ __ ] out

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:41.000
but until then they're gonna keep doing

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.380
I think they're stop I think it's

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:43.820
stopping lawfully I was watching I was

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:46.130
watching SNL and I was going but then

01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:47.900
again you get into the and this is where

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.100
the conspiracy stuff does get annoying

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:51.590
because it's almost an endless thing of

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:53.420
like all it doesn't even matter at this

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.740
point they get there just purely trying

01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:56.240
to propagandize and it's like no others

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.560
people are trying to make money off of

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.620
like a lot of i also i remember i

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:02.750
remember when i was studying propaganda

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:04.220
in school and i was just like Oh

01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:06.560
everything's propaganda like as soon as

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.880
i heard about is like i'll [ __ ] I didn't

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.380
know that like literally every single

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.540
thing is propaganda then yeah in terms

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.480
it is advertising but everything if what

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.860
it's like where does the line if it's

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:18.770
like like Nick Nick juniors as was made

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:21.290
to sell toys to little kids like the

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:22.850
purpose of Nick jr. is from an

01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:25.400
advertising think tank to get the whole

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.880
purpose is it's called a engage a nag

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.750
yeah okay goes nagisa my mom so like

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.910
that's the that's where Nick jr. is made

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:36.650
so it's like that's kind of sinister to

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:38.560
turn a kid into like a weird little like

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.090
mom mom the mom might not have enough

01:05:41.090 --> 01:05:42.770
money and the kids like kids starts

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:44.210
crying just because like it wants some

01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:46.490
dumb [ __ ] play-doh and it's like

01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:47.930
you're down that's a kind of an evil

01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:50.210
thing to do so it's like how evil does

01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:52.460
the how you know what can someone live

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.320
with if you're doing a business we're

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.300
like I'm gonna get kids to cry and have

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.190
their parents yeah yeah that's [ __ ]

01:05:58.190 --> 01:06:00.350
crazy yeah I'm gonna create a product so

01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:02.900
good that people cry to get it or not

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.460
even yes it's not even that good it's

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.750
like I'm gonna create a product and

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:07.310
target it to away and a four-year-old

01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:09.080
the way like they're I'm gonna tell me

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.570
to use experts insight cotton child

01:06:11.570 --> 01:06:13.790
psychology to craft a message that's so

01:06:13.790 --> 01:06:15.980
undeniable to a kid that if it doesn't

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:17.540
get it it'll be such a little miserable

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.340
[ __ ] that his parents will go [ __ ]

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:20.720
it and use their money and buy this

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.790
thing to shut their kid up that's an

01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:25.310
evil Enterprise it's capitalism baby

01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:27.050

damn but yeah I do that's my my problem

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:58.950
is now it's set up to where like I'm in

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.620
between just two total extremes dude and

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.600
there it's advantageous to like kind of

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.940
like you know you can cater to either

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.260
one of them that you I'm out that game

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:10.020
baby I heard I dabbled for a while and

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.300
all this what and catering to like just

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:14.550
all the like I don't know all the

01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:17.730
politics all the [ __ ] reddit and [ __ ]

01:08:17.730 --> 01:08:20.490
okay I can't do it what do you mean by

01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:21.750
that I just can't even be involved in

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:24.270
politics for sure I can't it's it's I

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:26.970
don't know anything I'm dumb I'm out my

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:28.170
thing is the people who are like

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:30.060
purporting to study this stuff closely

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.220
gets so sucked up on a one of the sides

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.140
that it's just kind of like I did like

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:36.030
you're gonna sit here and tell me all

01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:37.650
the good news like Ben Shapiro Cheryl is

01:08:37.650 --> 01:08:39.060
just like here's all the things that's

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.500
sick to be a Republican about and it's

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.170
just like you know you're not any point

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.430
your argument are you like yeah well

01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:45.810
this is one kind of weird part well

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:47.089
guess who it is mark

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:50.000
it is yeah Republicans it's gonna go and

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.380
be like hey you guys are great the other

01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:53.210
side's bet that's what all these people

01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:55.369
are doing every single time no matter

01:08:55.369 --> 01:08:56.869
what the network is too much of an

01:08:56.869 --> 01:08:58.909
Apollonian dude it's my face my downfall

01:08:58.909 --> 01:09:03.290
maybe but sure all of these are doing

01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:05.359
the same thing Fox News every for sure

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:07.339
they're like our sides good other sides

01:09:07.339 --> 01:09:10.009
bad if a shooting happens our sides good

01:09:10.009 --> 01:09:10.520
yeah

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.900
look at what the other side even the

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.549
Republicans are like or the or Fox News

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:14.960
is like they're trying to take your guns

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.449
true anytime there's a shooting like

01:09:17.449 --> 01:09:19.159
instead of you know praying about it

01:09:19.159 --> 01:09:20.389
they're making it political and trying

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.279
to take your guns and the other side's

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:23.900
like Trump won't call it white terrorism

01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:26.659
yeah white terrorists he meanwhile China

01:09:26.659 --> 01:09:28.609
setting up like a social Curtis social

01:09:28.609 --> 01:09:33.020
credit system China's like where the

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.969
media don't worry about the [ __ ] two

01:09:34.969 --> 01:09:40.730
parties ahead [ __ ] cut off give me

01:09:40.730 --> 01:09:42.349
the heebie jeebies and we're controlling

01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:44.119
the entire world while the United States

01:09:44.119 --> 01:09:45.980
rips itself apart tell me People's

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.810
Republic it's on doing its own doing

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:48.830
we're doing this to ourselves

01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:50.179
there's no I know that everybody's like

01:09:50.179 --> 01:09:53.349
Russia all these other things it's us

01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:55.699
that's dude that's what the literally

01:09:55.699 --> 01:09:57.020
exactly what the article in the Atlantic

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.730
said that it turned into like the

01:09:58.730 --> 01:10:00.110
Atlantic with the Atlantic does is like

01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:03.050
shreds it'll like build up arguments to

01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:04.880
talk about stuff on the left for the

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.320
most part they like mix stuff in here

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.090
there but this guy wrote an article in

01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:09.260
he's just shredding like Trump

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.730
supporters and then another data and

01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:13.040
then it like the last page is him being

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.750
like and also like this applies to left

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:16.730
and hold like sneak that it'll sneak a

01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:17.900
whole thing and basically about that

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.639
we're just now left to our own crazy

01:10:19.639 --> 01:10:22.280
devices to interpret just like all these

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.750
mixed messages and all you can do is

01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:25.130
either jump aboard to one of them and

01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:27.110
just live in a little vacuum or you just

01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:45.200
England America drops a nuke on them or

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.240
something we're like Anglican but hey

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.710
guys you owe us wonder I don't know I

01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:50.900
bet if someone bombed England we'd have

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:53.050
to be a bet if something happened to

01:17:53.050 --> 01:17:55.280
some of these countries Trump is

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.710
vindictive enough to be like remember

01:17:57.710 --> 01:18:00.020
when you called me fat Oh remember when

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:01.700
you guys would call me fat maybe the g20

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:04.600
not very funny now sand the best deleted

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.590
you have to sand the best and then we'll

01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:10.700
blow them I mean good lord imagine if

01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:13.730
there was World War 3 and our our FDR

01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:16.790
was [ __ ] Trump he's so embarrassing

01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:18.920
all the history books just pictures of

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.230
that guy just like we did it we won

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:23.510
we're the best that's this is something

01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:25.310
I really do get into and I wonder about

01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:27.530
if they could would you follow any of

01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:30.470
these world issues full-scale the

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:33.140
overpopulation is like a looming serious

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.180
problem and I and this is like this is

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:36.290
like Jones talks about breakaway

01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:38.570
civilization [ __ ] yeah I do wonder if

01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:40.100
people just like people who have lots

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:41.570
and lots of money or like due to all

01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:43.340
these problems go away if we just kill

01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:46.640
like five billion people so they could

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.430
engage World War three hit the bunks

01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:51.500
live it out and then just really come

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.300
out like you know have their like have

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.770
their ancestors come out and do like

01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:57.290
totally blank slate but I don't know if

01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:58.880
we know nuclear weapons house Hiroshima

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.890
holding up no I doubt great like I

01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:02.240
wonder if they dropped a bomb on

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.100
Hiroshima just to see like how long it

01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.330
takes how long back there and you can

01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:08.420
chill cuz that was pretty uncle I mean

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:10.340
there were being bad boys do know that

01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:13.460
was called for bomb anything bomb and

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.500
now they're sitting Aki they hit like a

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.390
day later you think they did one or like

01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:19.100
do it again that would do do look we got

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.680
another one [ __ ] it they need to get the

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.070
point

01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:23.780
so can you people live in Nagasaki now

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:27.920
right probably so you if you were to be

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.050
like look we got places we can live

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:32.180
we're gonna start World War three let's

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.520
all be dead in fifty years people that

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.110
would control so maybe they're waiting

01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:37.910
for the medical technology all the

01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:39.770
transhumanism and [ __ ] yeah well that's

01:19:39.770 --> 01:19:40.910
what they're saying what's-his-face was

01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:43.100
in the UH I mean who's the [ __ ]

01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:45.110
pedophile Epstein apparently that guy

01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:47.270
this is the near town that's why they're

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:48.980
taking the faces off those kids and

01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:50.180
Hillary was wearing them and dancing

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:51.680

losing his mind yeah [ __ ] like that

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.840
guys they threw him in there on a wing

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.910
and a prayer being like people know who

01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:59.740

do it he's not gonna leak it's gonna

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.420
have to be Elizabeth Warren I do i

crusher Gabbard he's gonna crush any of

01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:17.230
these people he have a camera there's a

01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:18.400
spud there's a fair point

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.320
flood said Gabbar is like a hot young

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.240
chick with in her fertile years kind of

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.340
and he was all this is his point he said

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:26.740
she was fertile it's all he's talking in

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.390
biological terms he said a lot of old

01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:31.390
men don't like another man like being

01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:32.980
nasty to i but then again I wouldn't

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:34.120
really just that wouldn't really it

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.770

of crushed pretty hard no no yeah

01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:38.590
everyone was pretty high so you can

01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:39.940
flatten that theory although their

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:43.210
theory I like it but yeah man I don't

01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:44.830

01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:10.580
well the only thing you can do is like

01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:13.610
get like a million people standing

01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:14.660
somewhere together and then they're like

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.550
ah [ __ ] cuz that's the main thing like

01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:18.140
at any point you could just half a

01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:19.640
million people like [ __ ] this you could

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:21.290
scale the White House and just totally

01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:23.360
kill everybody but it's like you know

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:24.380
they're not kind no one's gonna do that

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:28.070
cuz it's like don't be a terrorist guy

01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:30.500
[ __ ] terrorists a [ __ ] evil dude

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.890
tears are gay yeah but it's like dude

01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:35.360
everyone it's just you know I don't know

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.010
I don't think it's gonna stop it's not

01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:39.620
he's not like people it's I think it I

01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:41.390
not dude I just talked about over two

01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:42.980
hours I think it's a spinning wheel dude

01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:45.260
to be like and then if we do this and we

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:48.110
do this it's like I created it's like I

01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:52.010
agree yeah true dad I can't again I when

01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:53.510
we started that's all I talked about was

01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:55.040
like gender politics all this [ __ ] I

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.960
can't I literally stopped doing that

01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:59.450
because it's just it's fine that now of

01:25:59.450 --> 01:26:00.890
course you going to school [ __ ]

01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:03.290
brings you right back into it and and

01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:05.120
with stand-up it was really [ __ ]

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.840
annoying because all that it was how is

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.580
it now people stop that I don't deal

01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:12.530
with it yeah so it's good what about the

01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:15.080
people's materials it's still like I'm

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.450
starting to see a bit of a flip back to

01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:19.310
just whatever's funny yeah people trying

01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:21.050
to see people making fun of liberals you

01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:24.260
know really yeah but we were only seeing

01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:26.270
it at a local level of just [ __ ]

01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:28.400
everybody here was just jockeying to be

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.410
cool nobody here was trying to make a

01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:33.020
career out of stand-up I disagree I

01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:34.669
think a lot of people were actually

01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:37.010
in their head thinking that a were and

01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:40.959
that's how you okay well everybody like

01:26:40.959 --> 01:26:43.820
it's not very realistic sure yeah but I

01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:45.380
think dude if you were to tap those guys

01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:47.479
make your time they wouldn't be like I

01:26:47.479 --> 01:26:50.119
can't maybe like alright but everyone I

01:26:50.119 --> 01:26:51.760
think most people doing stand-up are

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.229
diluted in some sense thinking like it's

01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:55.820
going to happen for me all I have to do

01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:58.159
is continue like it's always hard for

01:26:58.159 --> 01:27:00.469
you it's rare to meet somebody and stand

01:27:00.469 --> 01:27:02.059
up that's like no I just do this for fun

01:27:02.059 --> 01:27:05.090
it's very rare it's rare everybody like

01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:07.010
I remember the first like a couple times

01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:09.110
I wrote a set I wrote it like I was in a

01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:14.659
theater and I was like pause for a beer

01:27:14.659 --> 01:27:26.649
for a giant applause Orientals yeah but

01:27:26.649 --> 01:27:30.050
yeah all that [ __ ] all that social

01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:31.429
justice [ __ ] I don't see it in New York

01:27:31.429 --> 01:27:34.999
at all good not really I mean definitely

01:27:34.999 --> 01:27:38.510
not Brooklyn Mike's at someplace I like

01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:40.130
so you see it yeah once you're out of

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:43.729
open mikes and into just who's good you

01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:45.380
that shit's irrelevant yeah because I

01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:46.969
was an open mikes you're jockeying to

01:27:46.969 --> 01:27:49.369
have somebody like you somebody that

01:27:49.369 --> 01:27:51.079
runs the mic like you chances are it's a

01:27:51.079 --> 01:27:52.939
chick that runs the mic so you get on

01:27:52.939 --> 01:27:55.760
stage women were powerful oh was that

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.469
good yeah you know start calling you a

01:27:57.469 --> 01:28:01.639
friend of the room yeah one of them then

01:28:01.639 --> 01:28:04.880
she accuses you or something wow that's

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.519
that's the path of an open mic er yeah

01:28:07.519 --> 01:28:09.079
that's the typical life cycle that's

01:28:09.079 --> 01:28:10.669
like that could be related to one of

01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:11.929
like you know if you're [ __ ] if

01:28:11.929 --> 01:28:13.550
you're on your quest dude that's like a

01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:16.159
Medusa head siren thing to get stuck in

01:28:16.159 --> 01:28:18.380
local SJW yeah that's something easy

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:22.579
turn you in a stone no no I'm 35 and I

01:28:22.579 --> 01:28:24.019
still live here and I'm still doing that

01:28:24.019 --> 01:28:32.449
yeah dude yeah yeah I'm Tony that's well

01:28:32.449 --> 01:28:33.559
there was a there were some quote I

01:28:33.559 --> 01:28:34.880
forgot who said it they're like culture

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.189
is a intelligence test and if you like

01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:39.829
fully abide by it you fail so if you

01:28:39.829 --> 01:28:41.119
like if you're in a surrounding you're

01:28:41.119 --> 01:28:43.699
like yeah this is perfect yeah you just

01:28:43.699 --> 01:28:45.829
tapped out mentally congratulations but

01:28:45.829 --> 01:28:48.020
it's also that's kind of what your

01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:50.210
supposed to do on some level yeah sorry

01:28:50.210 --> 01:28:51.980
bribery I've been following all of that

01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:53.390
dude that book all thinks shiny is the

01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:54.950
best really it takes you through the

01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:59.300
whole thought process of like like Homer

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.070
the Greeks I talked about all that then

01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:04.760
they talk about how when so they the

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:06.440
Hebrews that we're like ah right dude

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.450
you got a [ __ ] beat there's ten laws

01:29:08.450 --> 01:29:10.430
Ten Commandments as long as you don't

01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:12.830
break these you're cool no matter what

01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:14.480
and then JC came through it was like

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.950
well you gotta give money to the

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:17.240
homeless yeah exactly

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:18.410
well his whole thing was like if you

01:29:18.410 --> 01:29:20.720
want don't don't kill me if you want to

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.700
[ __ ] someone's wife and all you think

01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:23.900
about [ __ ] their wife they're like

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:26.690
that's kind of [ __ ] up bad don't no no

01:29:26.690 --> 01:29:27.740
as long as you don't [ __ ] their wife and

01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:29.150
then Jesus is basically being like no no

01:29:29.150 --> 01:29:30.830
no don't forget about the law it's all

01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:32.780
about how you feel inside so that's what

01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:34.280
yeah there's a start-up post-modernism

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:35.750
dude it opened up all right now it's

01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:37.160
like no you're gonna you can interpret

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:37.970
it yourself

01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:39.560
like you know what it means and now it's

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:40.790
like yeah that's spun off through

01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:42.410
thousands of years and here we are dude

01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:43.250
what's that called

01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:45.410
in Catholicism I was taught like if you

01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:47.500
even think of sin you're doing it yeah

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:51.590
geez horrible would you ever say that

01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:53.810
that was obviously you think of the

01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:55.640
worst [ __ ] that was the JC revolution

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.140
cuz it was like you had these guys who

01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.820
had just held themselves on these rules

01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:00.170
and had everything structured so it's

01:30:00.170 --> 01:30:01.130
like alright follow these rules

01:30:01.130 --> 01:30:02.630
everything will stay exactly the same

01:30:02.630 --> 01:30:05.300
and JC was just like yeah but you also

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:07.190
can be kind of a nice guy like if I heal

01:30:07.190 --> 01:30:09.050
somebody's blah you know whatever it was

01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:10.370
they were like then they were basically

01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:12.200
like well you did that but it was Sunday

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.430
and you broke the law and he was like

01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:14.540
yeah but this guy can't like walk I

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:15.890
think that was like a symbolic parable

01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:17.720
but he'd be like yeah but this guy can

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.090
walk and you're crying about what it was

01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:21.890
Sunday dude [ __ ] you yeah that's why

01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:24.230
they're like oh we're gonna kill this

01:30:24.230 --> 01:30:24.820
guy

01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:27.350
I wonder if while he was talking to a

01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:28.640
guy guy was like smiling and nodding

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:33.680
like I'm allowed to kill this guy we're

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:35.450
gonna kill him yeah for sure

01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:37.370
dude that's uh but they walk through

01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:38.990
that and all the way to like then it got

01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:41.000
to the point we're like Gucci stuff

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.320
where it's like you know it's like

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.900
religion yet religions dead you have to

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:46.550
fully come up with your own code and now

01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:48.020
here we are and like people being like

01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:50.180
in charge of their own me look I don't

01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:51.920
trust the media like I know what's going

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.930
on you so you don't have any idea yeah

01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:55.190
no one has any idea besides what's going

01:30:55.190 --> 01:30:56.450
on in their life and they don't have any

01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:58.790
idea about that for the most part so my

01:30:58.790 --> 01:31:01.370
things like dude just [ __ ] wake up go

01:31:01.370 --> 01:31:01.790
to work

01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:03.710
try to be nice everybody knows [ __ ]

01:31:03.710 --> 01:31:06.530
relax try not to watch the news yeah try

01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:08.000
not to get in a political argument with

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:08.630
your friends

01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:10.580

01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:14.270
that shit's useless sucks yeah

01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:18.290
so either way but yes that was like that

01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:20.030
but I'm a big solution head dude so my

01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:21.950
head it's like what is the what is the

01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:24.050
way out of this there's give me a sound

01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:26.030
bite of you doing all the things that

01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:31.460
you are I'm a fighter I'm a Texan well I

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:33.560
was man I'm a solution I mean I'm not

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.080
gonna say I'm a pull-up Apollonian again

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:39.260
do your very own I mean is what it is

01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:41.330
dude I'm an INFP it's like 1% of the

01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:43.010
world's nobody deal but like either way

01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:45.470
you're special you believe you're

01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:47.600
special I have high arches that's 1% of

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.510
the population Green is very rare I'm

01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:54.140
not bragging no no I think it's gonna be

01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:55.430
I think it's nice for humans to believe

01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:56.600
that they're special like that well

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.460
statistically I am but I don't want to

01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:00.200
talk about it high arches that's a very

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.850
low percentage green eyes low presenting

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:04.370
giant fe even lower but again I don't

01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:06.260
I'd rather be in every man rather be a

01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:08.300
common man that's that I think is your

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:10.070
biggest dilemma what you just wish you

01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:11.450
were [ __ ] everyman but instead you're

01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:13.130
just this unicorn I'm trying to dissolve

01:32:13.130 --> 01:32:15.290
into the fabric of society wish you were

01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:16.790
[ __ ] donkey but instead you're a

01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:19.010
[ __ ] stallion you're a unicorn you

01:32:19.010 --> 01:32:20.990
wish you're in the mud like a dirty mule

01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:23.720
or I'm just a dirty mule with like my

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:28.040
head I'm like with a head injury it

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:29.780
could be one of those I read about five

01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:31.520
pages of blood written this week it was

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.550
pretty good yeah we can at this rate

01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:36.710
I'll finish it in 2038

01:32:36.710 --> 01:32:38.720
Hill real riff there now I know it'll

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.070
hook into you eventually I actually just

01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:41.840
I refinished I put it on putting out a

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.910
second edition my book nice fixed all

01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:46.910
the typos plain throws in bro no no no

01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:49.130
well that'll be in first a dish fixed

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:50.600
all the typos made the font bigger a

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.940
little easier on the eyes also was

01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:54.530
minuscule well I wanted to make it as

01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:56.210
cheap as possible for people but I like

01:32:56.210 --> 01:32:57.590
thought I was hooking people up I'm

01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:58.820
making it super cheap

01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:00.260
every other book on Amazon it's ten

01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:02.330
bucks I make literally 50 cents on every

01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:05.450
book so I you know whatever I've made

01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:07.310
thirteen dollars from Kindle royalties

01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:12.860
since I I don't even care about that IOU

01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:14.420
I like to be able to read it big that's

01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:15.590
awesome which people on the same

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:17.540
but I'm going through it I'm like dude

01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:19.280
there are so many [ __ ] tight I was

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.960
I'm embarrassed I mean this is horrible

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:23.630
so I fixed it tweak the ending to I

01:33:23.630 --> 01:33:26.180
finally finally came through and was

01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:27.530
like second edition is a different

01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:30.140
ending now slightly it aims a similar it

01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:31.670
ends the same for the most part but

01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:33.650
there's a final climax of one of the

01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:35.510
people that I I feel like I just like

01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:36.860
got to the end of it it was like my 10th

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:39.110
time writing and I'm like well this is

01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:41.060
just when it has to be finally figured

01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:42.440
it out it came full circle I was like oh

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:44.480
I'm excited about that nice and then you

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:47.390

01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:51.560
it's out now in the same cover yes

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.510
there's like a few covers so fun people

01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:54.890
made fun of me it's a Google image cover

01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:56.570
highly pixelated sorry about that and

01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:58.550
[ __ ] you know I was gonna spend more

01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:00.890
artists now I have someone wouldn't pay

01:34:00.890 --> 01:34:02.120
someone to do a little cover art someone

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.410

01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:05.060
art so it'll be a second edition it's

01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:07.550
it's fixed now technically but the

01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:09.050

01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:23.510
be great psychedelics for squares the

01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:26.690

01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:30.710

psychotic Karen teaming up with a

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:33.470

01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.210
hallucinogenic voyage I think I

01:34:50.210 --> 01:34:51.440
personally feel a little more secure

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.780
when I have a manhood anka so I don't

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:56.270
see why I would hurt so we'll say dude

01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:57.770
but I got do I got my sleep tent set up

01:34:57.770 --> 01:35:01.010
so I have been inside my black outboard

01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:04.280

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:06.440
black outboard dude it's literally it's

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:07.640
it's pure darkness

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.840
that's incredible I mean there at

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:10.700
nighttime I literally I went I was like

01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:12.110
actually really tired than one night and

01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:13.460
Britney was down with her friends and I

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:15.050
was like alright you guys do your thing

01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:17.270
Britney come get me I laid in this thing

01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:19.310
dude it's like when you hit pure

01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:21.560
darkness and you go to sleep it feels

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.240
like you're just like literally being

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.980
separated out of your body is like oh my

01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:28.400
god yeah like you just pass out it's so

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:28.909
nice

01:35:28.909 --> 01:35:30.800
easy she came and woke me up and I was

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.889
like oh so yeah man I got the full sleep

01:35:33.889 --> 01:35:34.519
tent setup

01:35:34.519 --> 01:35:37.999
I'm fully done the first book I'm free

01:35:37.999 --> 01:35:40.400
from propaganda dude fully and are you I

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:43.189
think so dude I think so that's what

01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:46.369
everyone thinks no one's free I mean at

01:35:46.369 --> 01:35:49.340
least me I never recite a media thing as

01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:51.260
fact I always say this is what I saw

01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:53.269
oops you have to take it in the way you

01:35:53.269 --> 01:35:55.159
know I don't ever take it I try not to

01:35:55.159 --> 01:35:59.419
at least yeah which is bad but Korean

01:35:59.419 --> 01:36:00.619
we're careening towards something dude

01:36:00.619 --> 01:36:02.209
the fact that like you can't really

01:36:02.209 --> 01:36:04.340
trust the media you can't be you can't

01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:05.900
say a bad thing about the government but

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:06.889
you also there's a bunch of weird

01:36:06.889 --> 01:36:08.150
conspiracies that make it like really

01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:11.570
dumb to do that it's like we're in a bad

01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:12.860
spot we're in a tough spot it's a weird

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:14.630
spot for sure you can definitely say bad

01:36:14.630 --> 01:36:18.050
things about this government that's true

01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:20.419
but it's but not about the operative

01:36:20.419 --> 01:36:22.849
day-to-day operations you can't you can

01:36:22.849 --> 01:36:25.249
say Trump's government is the most evil

01:36:25.249 --> 01:36:27.679
trouble still there but if you say the

01:36:27.679 --> 01:36:30.079
government set up a thing and then you

01:36:30.079 --> 01:36:33.409
know maybe yeah well yeah if you say the

01:36:33.409 --> 01:36:35.749
government did Sandy Hook who said Trump

01:36:35.749 --> 01:36:38.289
did Sandy Hook I feel like [ __ ] yeah

01:36:38.289 --> 01:36:40.820
Bush knocked down the towers I mean dude

01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:47.179
that was a Jadakiss song I know people

01:36:47.179 --> 01:36:48.499
were just trying to live their lives man

01:36:48.499 --> 01:36:51.110
you know what's it what's that Fox News

01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:53.119
you'll like it I mean I love it you

01:36:53.119 --> 01:36:55.669
already know this but it's just the news

01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:58.880
is entertainment see like that's where I

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:00.709
think you and I have like I don't think

01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:06.039
it's as you know calculated a

01:37:06.039 --> 01:37:07.969
manipulative but I don't think it's like

01:37:07.969 --> 01:37:10.309
this like I mean I don't think it's a

01:37:10.309 --> 01:37:11.959
global collective thing I think it's

01:37:11.959 --> 01:37:13.849
very easy like Roger Ailes at one point

01:37:13.849 --> 01:37:15.739
calls Dick Cheney cuz there being that

01:37:15.739 --> 01:37:17.389
while they were in the office they were

01:37:17.389 --> 01:37:19.369
being [ __ ] and Roger Ailes was like

01:37:19.369 --> 01:37:21.919
do you want to invade Iraq cuz I can

01:37:21.919 --> 01:37:22.579
make that happen

01:37:22.579 --> 01:37:24.139
or I can make that not happen so you

01:37:24.139 --> 01:37:25.489
guys better start [ __ ] treating us

01:37:25.489 --> 01:37:26.269
with some respect

01:37:26.269 --> 01:37:28.880
yeah and he was like alright we'll do

01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:31.639
whatever you say the defano guy said

01:37:31.639 --> 01:37:33.530
that yeah Dick Cheney was like yeah

01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:35.949
we're gonna invade Iraq so let us and

01:37:35.949 --> 01:37:39.079
foxnews really okay how they get this on

01:37:39.079 --> 01:37:40.900
the phone it's Fitz

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:42.699
it's not it's I mean it they're fine

01:37:42.699 --> 01:37:44.409
there's [ __ ] around alleged phone

01:37:44.409 --> 01:37:47.920
call sales was pissed at that

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:49.449
administration he was like let me talk

01:37:49.449 --> 01:37:51.850
to [ __ ] Dick Cheney right now I mean

01:37:51.850 --> 01:37:54.130
which makes sense Roger Ailes controlled

01:37:54.130 --> 01:37:55.449
half the country

01:37:55.449 --> 01:37:57.909
you control the Fox News he controlled

01:37:57.909 --> 01:38:00.780
the entire Republican base every day

01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:03.310
yeah and you're saying that's immune to

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:05.500
being tweaked by business interests and

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:06.850
political no that's exactly what it is

01:38:06.850 --> 01:38:08.469
okay but I don't think it's this like

01:38:08.469 --> 01:38:10.750
Illuminati satanic [ __ ] you know to me

01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:13.239
that I think just clearly just like hey

01:38:13.239 --> 01:38:15.580
worry we need to make more money don't

01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:17.050
[ __ ] with us again if you guys want to

01:38:17.050 --> 01:38:19.210
do something I control what everyone

01:38:19.210 --> 01:38:21.280
thinks so don't look don't [ __ ] with me

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:23.080
so how is that not bleeding into a like

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:25.360
an Illuminati conspiracy land it's not

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:28.230
Illuminati it's just not the Illuminati

01:38:28.230 --> 01:38:29.980
[ __ ] people who believe in the

01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:31.659
Illuminati think the Illuminati is you

01:38:31.659 --> 01:38:33.489
know there's some sort of satanic cult

01:38:33.489 --> 01:38:35.199
with dudes and hoods and candles that

01:38:35.199 --> 01:38:37.239
show newest morph of it the loominatee

01:38:37.239 --> 01:38:38.800
is exactly what you just described and

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:39.880
that's what I've called the Illuminati

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:42.130
since we started talking about it now we

01:38:42.130 --> 01:38:43.330
never say you don't believe in the

01:38:43.330 --> 01:38:46.630
Illuminati no no dude see you it's not

01:38:46.630 --> 01:38:48.429
some dastardly like all the Rothschilds

01:38:48.429 --> 01:38:50.469
or do it's just like here's the most

01:38:50.469 --> 01:38:52.300
rich people and they're gonna try to

01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:55.030
stay rich yeah exactly

01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:56.860
something like oh let's set up sandy

01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:59.890
hook okay but what do they do to stay

01:38:59.890 --> 01:39:01.540
you know to keep a billion dollars a

01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:03.580
billion dollars and make sure people

01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:04.960
don't like [ __ ] with your things that

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.219
are keeping on the money come up you

01:39:06.219 --> 01:39:09.730
have to do things like if you have tons

01:39:09.730 --> 01:39:10.960
your hands and all they're gonna

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.489
disagree on anything if you have your

01:39:12.489 --> 01:39:14.260
hands in a bunch of foreign interests

01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:16.210
and you're just like pulling in money

01:39:16.210 --> 01:39:17.949
here and there and almost on some guy

01:39:17.949 --> 01:39:19.150
uprising in that country

01:39:19.150 --> 01:39:21.670
you call fox and go like yo dude i don't

01:39:21.670 --> 01:39:23.560
like this new leader here sure follow of

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.090
life you can pull that off which i think

01:39:25.090 --> 01:39:28.449
people can in have that is the stuff of

01:39:28.449 --> 01:39:30.429
the illumina now exactly now the new

01:39:30.429 --> 01:39:34.000
thing about like sano satanic corpse is

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.190
i mean they're doing I don't know

01:39:36.190 --> 01:39:38.679
shootings and shooting a movie I doubt

01:39:38.679 --> 01:39:39.010
it

01:39:39.010 --> 01:39:41.710
I doubt it - I agree with that but now

01:39:41.710 --> 01:39:43.210
does that mean they're not putting foot

01:39:43.210 --> 01:39:44.770
they're not doing coos and [ __ ]

01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:47.739
Panama sure they are doing that but

01:39:47.739 --> 01:39:50.020
maybe they're funding like weird fringe

01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:51.820
political groups so like maybe be like

01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:54.370
agent provocateurs at other people

01:39:54.370 --> 01:39:55.750
rallies like yeah I think they do that

01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:57.730
is there so where does it stop that's

01:39:57.730 --> 01:39:59.110
the thing that's me that's where I'm

01:39:59.110 --> 01:40:02.380
like I don't know you know I don't know

01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:03.760
where the line where the line would be

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.640
for someone who would go disrupt like

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.830
the food in a third-world country

01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:10.360
yeah and it's like totally cool with

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:12.760
basically having slaves is gonna be like

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.080
well we're not gonna [ __ ] like you

01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:15.730
know we're not gonna kill kids it's like

01:40:15.730 --> 01:40:18.190
that's where I'm like it's plausible

01:40:18.190 --> 01:40:21.490
but it's also so hard to have a massive

01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:23.170
the other word stops is like to have a

01:40:23.170 --> 01:40:25.630
massive organization that's constantly

01:40:25.630 --> 01:40:27.730
shooting up malls in schools that's

01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:30.040
impossible to pull off yeah I think

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:31.600
that's kind of like I said I think they

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.070
would have been like I listen we gotta

01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:34.060
come up with something different

01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:35.860
exactly the school shootings not working

01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:37.870
people ordinary people are on to us

01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:40.570
people know we set this out I'm kind of

01:40:40.570 --> 01:40:43.390
nervous about this so we've done 50 of

01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:46.510
them yeah I mean that's let's just see

01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:47.560
everything to think about if there's

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.150
people who could stay the course and be

01:40:49.150 --> 01:40:51.760
like hold though eventually a few more

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.500
shootings and they'll give us their guns

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:57.040
and then what yeah I mean that would be

01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:00.100
the most epic I told you so dude if

01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:01.720
you're like alright fine enough school

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.250
shootings here's our guns like social

01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:06.250
credit systems like a half god [ __ ]

01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:06.790
told you

01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:08.920
yeah that would but again I don't think

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:11.440
it's like Fox News I don't think a gun

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.990
so we can enslave them it's like no

01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:16.300
we're we're just trying to make the news

01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:18.130
entertaining yeah so we're gonna stir up

01:41:18.130 --> 01:41:20.590
controversies and conspiracies non-stop

01:41:20.590 --> 01:41:23.220
so that people are watching you can sell

01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:26.080
advertisement yeah I mean dude this is

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.330
it is weird to even get like I don't

01:41:28.330 --> 01:41:30.700
care about guns I don't really give a

01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:31.780
[ __ ] about them I think they're cool I

01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:33.340
can't last time I had a guy was shooting

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:35.140
a gun I was walking down the parking lot

01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:36.520
I dropped it accidentally so I shouldn't

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:39.520
have definitely can't have one I don't

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.380
yeah I went [ __ ] shooting I drop the

01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:42.730
gun dude whatever somebody deal but the

01:41:42.730 --> 01:41:49.150
[ __ ] I got what do you do with that

01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:51.040
let me hold it I'm like no [ __ ] I can

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.810
hold it I can hold it shut up I can

01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:54.370
while you're off to it dropped on the

01:41:54.370 --> 01:41:55.690
way out you know I was even paying

01:41:55.690 --> 01:41:57.340
attention literally like a dog I just my

01:41:57.340 --> 01:42:02.170
hand release nothing so yeah there's

01:42:02.170 --> 01:42:03.940
like they needed the government needs to

01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:04.840
take your guns away

01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:06.670
they sure do I should well they

01:42:06.670 --> 01:42:07.830
literally did because I've a mad

01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:09.540
card not allowed to have a gun oh nice

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:11.700
yeah so like if you have a B although

01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:13.770
it's a get constitutionally I could make

01:42:13.770 --> 01:42:15.330
a case and go there's like I talked to a

01:42:15.330 --> 01:42:16.410
gun store guy the one when I was

01:42:16.410 --> 01:42:17.430
shooting I was like what's the deal with

01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:19.050
that he was like amen

01:42:19.050 --> 01:42:20.730
anyone's right to bear gun so like

01:42:20.730 --> 01:42:21.870
they'll sell you a gun but you're

01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:24.000
technically not allowed to whatever some

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.770
weird it was a loophole for the same

01:42:25.770 --> 01:42:28.680
base really to be Leia whose people have

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.330
read can't have guns can they or like we

01:42:30.330 --> 01:42:31.620
won't give them guns and you own a gun

01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:32.550
store like we won't take your

01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:36.570
constitutional right yeah but yeah dude

01:42:36.570 --> 01:42:39.270
be like we need more AR v we need people

01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:42.120
to have ar-15s as a bad but dude it

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:43.890
it'll all get so that's where I started

01:42:43.890 --> 01:42:45.870
yet propagandize I'm like I can't have a

01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:47.430
[ __ ] ar-15 then in my head I'm like

01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:48.810
I'm gonna have only a gun

01:42:48.810 --> 01:42:50.340
yeah I'm like see I like walk with my

01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:55.440
kitchen knives my careful yeah yeah baby

01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:57.660
cool to have an hour fifteen it'd be

01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:01.380
[ __ ] cool to have but my water yeah

01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:02.760
be awesome but it's also dude imagine

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.530
the [ __ ] being the dudes who sell

01:43:04.530 --> 01:43:06.120
guns and you see school shootings and

01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:08.040
you're just like we got to spend this

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:09.540
dude that's a whole that's the thing no

01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:10.950
one else talks about now everyone so I

01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:13.020
think the NRA yeah but I'm saying if

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.430
you're like a hardcore conspiracy

01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:17.240
theorist why would you think the NRA

01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.440
wasn't being like I'm pretty sure

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:21.000
[ __ ] someone set these school

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.740
shootings up if you throw that out in

01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:24.570
the river it's like it Matt that's a

01:43:24.570 --> 01:43:26.070
whole other part they could fully be

01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:27.450
like dude you know you don't want this

01:43:27.450 --> 01:43:28.710
country taking your guns dude what are

01:43:28.710 --> 01:43:30.060
you a [ __ ] [ __ ] and you're like yeah

01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:33.210
dude I'm not a [ __ ] I want guns because

01:43:33.210 --> 01:43:35.820
the [ __ ] state this sales skyrocket

01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:38.130
yeah everyone gets scared that like

01:43:38.130 --> 01:43:39.510
they're gonna take this is the one

01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:40.740
they're gonna take them and this [ __ ]

01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:42.540
concept so if you really want to get in

01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:46.950
a conspiracy land it's like okay I mean

01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:48.300
they're too Christian apparently they

01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:49.770
wouldn't but do you think retards are

01:43:49.770 --> 01:43:50.910
shooting up school these are just

01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:52.290
shooting up schools in the NRA is like

01:43:52.290 --> 01:43:56.580
yes I know that maybe they do sell

01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:59.240
enough guns like the dictators and stuff

01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:02.190
so weird dude no yet you live in a

01:44:02.190 --> 01:44:04.730
[ __ ] up world 143 34

01:44:04.730 --> 01:44:08.370

think you should you can talk about

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.300
conspiracy stuff I'm talking about

01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:32.650
conspiracy stuff on a middle-level

01:44:32.650 --> 01:44:34.480

01:44:42.670 --> 01:44:44.409
of this man's death what's the point of

01:44:44.409 --> 01:44:45.750

run by the Republicans possibly de saucé

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.110

bombs people out who are sober it's like

02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:35.410
the alternative of not being high is

02:10:35.410 --> 02:10:38.110
being sober and then you're like at

02:10:38.110 --> 02:10:39.940
McDonald's with like nine people you're

02:10:39.940 --> 02:10:41.200
