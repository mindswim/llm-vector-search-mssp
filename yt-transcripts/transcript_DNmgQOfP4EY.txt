[ __ ] I'm acting weird well no I knew I

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.020
was [ __ ] up I was like like almost

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.289
laying down like everybody was enjoying

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.849
it yeah that I was doing it but then the

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.120
night took a horrible turn had some

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.910
false rumors come out about me and

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.000
people I care about and just ruined of

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.470
the night and then you know you told me

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.660
you told me when you picked me up after

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.669
I told you I took half you're like well

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:39.690
you're not gonna be able to sleep really

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.150
mm-hmm took the whole thing and I did

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.970
not sleep didn't sleep just later time

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.410
it was like yeah it was like 11:00 when

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.419
I took the other half mm-hmm so that was

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.880
a long [ __ ] night and then I had to

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.250
do the one thing that is definitely true

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.940
about ecstasy is the hangover of

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.120
depression

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.440
yeah his that was dude Friday was brutal

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.140
I was going on no sleep I had to drive

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.960
to Baltimore to do a [ __ ] show I had

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.090
to do two shows and I got bombed two

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.740
shows just bomb actual bomb or like not

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.289
an OK set crowds definitely sucked but

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.030
also it definitely didn't help that I

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.140
was not happy true like I was just up

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.360
there like like normally stand-up like

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.890
with a hangover from booze

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.409
stand-up will cure that yeah there's the

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:33.180
adrenaline and like this is fun it gets

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.039
you out of a hangover this was a

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.950
different type of hanger serotonin

something and I went there Hemis I

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.490
remember my first blood pill yeah it was

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.900
instant like holy [ __ ] I'm dying

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.550
yeah my insides are bleeding this like

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.790

as I saw the blood on my chain yeah it's

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:37.040
real bummer honestly I the only I had

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.380
one ever that like hurt

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.630
yeah like hurt like I felt like I was

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.070
gonna puke while I was taking a [ __ ]

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.260
like it hurts so [ __ ] bad and had

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.000
that that was tough I've never had a

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.620
hemorrhoid that like hurt though like

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.440
that

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.810
I wonder where the [ __ ] my like may have

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.130
definitely had should be able to feel it

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.410
let me feel your butt oh I can fight you

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.710
if I if I like squeeze and contract my

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.330
butthole I can feel a little [ __ ]

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.190
sting that that's not usually there but

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.410
oh yeah it's probably I've been beating

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.790
the bag up dude it's probably me he

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.320
probably hit the bag too hard I think

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.760
what kind of hemorrhoid comes from

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.380
throwing like a super hard left hook at

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.210
a bag I have that I think I have that

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:20.280
one it was a lot of it was did you ever

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.000
take action I told my momma took it well

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.860
she says really what me because it was

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.120
my sister Katie's birthday happy

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.250
birthday Katie a beat we went out to

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.770
lunch me my mom and my sister and I was

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.630
like mom I [ __ ] took ecstasy less

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.430
she's like you know you better not get

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.860
addicted you know our family is prone to

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.400
addiction that's what I'm saying I gave

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.870
honestly if I get addicted to ecstasy

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.330
they be the sickest [ __ ] ever actually

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.170
be cool I know a lot of people who got

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.760
like real world into it for a while and

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.980
amazingly yeah it eventually the effects

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.620
just kind of wear off not my one friend

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.330
I will tell you this I never really got

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.010
into ecstasy I didn't I didn't it was

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.330
nothing that ever really drew me and I

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.130
don't think I'll ever do it again maybe

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.860
I'll do it but one of my boys took I

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.960
think he said hundreds of V bombs in

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.480
like the early 2000s and he said he was

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.740
like it's not that big of a deal but he

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.600
goes I have noticed now that like I

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.370
don't really ever get that happy or that

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.820
sad I'm just always kind of like that's

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.520
alright I'm saying eliminates the sad

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.200
part I can do without happiness he just

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.000
goes I'm kind of dislike he said he's

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.310
just kind of like a steady steady man

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.540
that might have just been him maturing a

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.270
might now that's a decent trade-off I'm

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.440
not very happy that often you get it

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.000
it's usually me like driving and

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.710
laughing about something [ __ ] dumb

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.870
yeah for like 10 minutes and then it's

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.900
back to just like oh man I [ __ ] sick

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.520
the thing of all your happiest moments

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.050
in life is in the wheel of the rolls if

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:56.070
you like where you're going like [ __ ] I

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.440
gotta [ __ ] work [ __ ] do stand-up

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.480
the one thing I ever actually like I'm

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.580
still like this is too hard

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.990
I was actually laughing the other day

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.970
thinking about uh that time I was

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.620
driving and called that kid a [ __ ] on

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.290
his bike oh my god I was driving home

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.330
from helium and my windows were down and

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.680
this kid was riding his bike I just had

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.090
a good set I was feeling good this is

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.430
actually one of my happier moments this

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.720
literally made me happy telling about it

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.940
and this kid was riding his bike he was

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.500
wearing like khakis he was coming from

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.770
work and he had his pant leg rolled it

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.530
was like highly believable Oh totally he

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.450
was like yeah he was just like he was on

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.770
like wall he was you know he was wearing

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.120
a button-down rolled-up khakis

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.010
definitely like a barstool sports fan

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:35.610
mm-hmm

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.850
so I Dryden by and I was just like [ __ ]

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.980
for no reason I was by myself I was by

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.650
myself got to a red light I saw him just

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.750
paddling hard and I was like oh [ __ ]

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.280
he's gonna catch up he's gonna get me

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.670
and then when he got close I was like he

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.620
might spit on me or punch me but I think

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.000
I got a I got to leave the windows down

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.310
hmm you gotta let him [ __ ] hit ya let

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.830
him get his [ __ ] rebuttal [ __ ]

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.170
pulled up bags to be like panting it's

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.700

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.440

and or if it's you've gone out so many

00:13:16.449 --> 00:13:17.709
times that I finally get guilted into

00:13:17.709 --> 00:13:20.230
coming up I just dude I just don't like

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.179
going to bars I don't unless like I'm

00:13:22.179 --> 00:13:23.889
gonna unless I decide like I'm gonna

00:13:23.889 --> 00:13:26.199
drink today's a day I'm gonna drink and

00:13:26.199 --> 00:13:28.989
go to a bar if I'm just reckoned to just

00:13:28.989 --> 00:13:31.179
like be at a be present at a bar without

00:13:31.179 --> 00:13:33.489

that's a nightmare that's a nightmare

00:13:34.749 --> 00:13:36.730
dude it's not fun so yeah my head I'm

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.689
like yo you know I have a but what

00:13:40.689 --> 00:13:42.730
you're saying is if it starts being like

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.610
a every three days forward you know what

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.559
I'm saying is I think the only times

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:49.119
I've really experienced that is it like

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:53.399
if a girl has plans and I'm not invited

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:55.749
then it [ __ ] like I'm like what the

00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:57.100
[ __ ] I I'm fun

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.670
I'll have fun at the bar yeah [ __ ] you

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.809
don't want me there it's not like I'm

00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:03.100
like worried about like getting cheated

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.769
on it's something I'm just like yeah if

00:14:05.769 --> 00:14:07.299
I knew I would invite you I would have

00:14:07.299 --> 00:14:09.040
invited you I don't care if you suck

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.079
around my friends still invite you my

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:13.389
thing is I am my main concern be worried

00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:14.739
but if she started going out all the

00:14:14.739 --> 00:14:16.839
time I'd be like oh all the time yeah

00:14:16.839 --> 00:14:19.149
that's a [ __ ] problem but my from my

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:22.089
fave might say mine is uh yeah like she

00:14:22.089 --> 00:14:23.079
was supposed to go out for lunch with

00:14:23.079 --> 00:14:24.670
her like her girlfriends and then she

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.649
was just like oh it turned out like all

00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:27.579

a good time really it's just kind of

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.329

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:45.830
possessed by dark energy because he like

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.660
focused there's a root chakras like I

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.070
guess underneath were like your balls

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.590
are your taint he went below that to

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.440
like a real primordial chakra dude below

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:58.580
his taint his taint eat ever yeah I must

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.230
be like I like the tip of a pimple on

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:01.460

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.110
chakra that it's like hovers around like

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.590
a butt pimple dude and he opened up dark

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:08.720
energy to the point where now he got

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.090
admitted into a psych facility and it's

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.040
got diagnosed with schizophrenia so now

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.920
balance the chakras shut down there's

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.440
malevolent force he's trying to settle

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.110
his chakras to beat schizophrenia yes I

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.750

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.210

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:27.380

being like you got to use your heart

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.580

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.170
of this beware because you're opening up

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:43.580
were you afraid

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.830

you were seeing people with

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.560
schizophrenia yeah I talked to him with

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.690

too a lot of them say that weed helps

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.930
them but it's like which probably is the

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:04.160
case cuz then they get stoned and they

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.540
can just be like I'm the stone having

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.650
weird thoughts and it's like not like

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.310
just coming from talking to yourself

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:12.080

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.820

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.320
a crazy breakdown yeah and hindsight

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.030

like it was [ __ ] it was banana and

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.930

mad [ __ ] pounds of be stirs and he

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.280

younger and [ __ ] he uh he started

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.679
like thinking like feds are after him

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:23.970
and all the [ __ ] he would literally

00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:26.010

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:49.139
housing agreement with this dude this

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.480

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.679
eating them but he just went in the

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:53.879

I'm up you know I'm not [ __ ] coming

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.790
out people hate me in the podcast but a

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.430
lot of the people a huge percentage of

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.470
the population there's yes men so when I

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:53.760
hear about people like going and doing

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.560
weird [ __ ] like it legitimately rocks

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.660
them at their at their foundation like

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.760
this guy set up a social experiment

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.790
where it all started by people thought

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.349
they're on some like casting thing for

00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:07.290
TV and they go into a room and so

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:09.030
there's like six chairs there's like 10

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:10.260
chairs and there's three people already

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.240
in the room and they're sitting down and

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.099
I get the hits a tone it goes beep and

00:37:14.099 --> 00:37:16.410
then everyone stands up and then you're

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:17.430
the fourth person in the room you're

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:19.109
watching people people send down beep

00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:21.180
stand up and then the person we go

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.950
whoever would like just start joining in

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:24.180
without asking any questions and start

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.980
joining in on this behavior he would

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.210
keep them if you didn't do it he would

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.099
get rid of you so then he filtered these

00:37:29.099 --> 00:37:30.540
people who are just naturally obedient

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.550
to like whatever was going on and put

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.800
him in this setting where I beg you know

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.240
we're gonna get back to you

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.310
and then he contacted them feel like

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:40.020
another way saying like you found out

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.130

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:42.390

sort of political affiliation but dude

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.370
when he goes in the end the guy thinks

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:25.810
he's going to Vegas and it's like this

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:27.010

Mexicans and dude I do not think it was

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:34.030
acting as you see the guy in there after

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:35.140

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.950
like when he's just sitting there he

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:40.510
like watches him leave and he's like all

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:43.300
right I'm getting and then like you know

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.740
at the end like the crazy should happen

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:47.290
what happens he ends up like they take

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:49.000
they chase the guys down like we got

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.310

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:52.540
kill they like we're gonna [ __ ] shoot

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.640
this guy and then they've been playing

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.500
this conditioning response part of the

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:57.430
thing where he thought he had a chip

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:58.870
implanted in him that like increase his

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:00.820
bravery and he does these meditations

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.500
where like a tone goes off and he's like

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.870
feel the like feel the energy and he's

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:06.550
like doing this and the guy was telling

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:08.620
him that like if you tap your head three

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.750
times you can like you know you're like

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:12.160
lose feeling in your hand he's like he

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.680
doesn't hypnotic tricks so the either

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.600

secretary she runs for demo demo

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:59.010
Democratic presidential nomination in I

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:01.130
believe that was oh seven oh eight

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:03.180
appointed Secretary of State right

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.610
Clinton Foundation money goes from

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:08.130
between oh four oh eight goes from fifty

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:11.100
million to like two hundred and fifty

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.780
million dollars when she gets appointed

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.820
Secretary of State then while in

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.350
Secretary of State goes up to three

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:19.170
hundred million dollars right sepsis

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:20.760
Tepes down from Secretary of State in

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.910
2012 and then when she's gonna start

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:25.590
running again for Democratic

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:27.960
presidential candidate it drops when she

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.330
steps down then goes back up to like

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:31.680
three hundred twenty five million

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.210
dollars when they she was running as

00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:35.580
Trump dude when she lost the election in

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.500
2016

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.080
back in 2017 the money that was going in

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.730
the foundation dropped it back to fifty

00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:44.220
million dollars its skyrocketed two

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:46.080
hundred million dollars while she was in

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.750
office so the the allegations are that

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:50.430
she was running like a pay-to-play or

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:53.100
like a pro quo thing and there's a [ __ ]

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.810
you know there's this the outside

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:56.100
numbers without even going through the

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.020
internal dossier yeah which is like

00:52:58.020 --> 00:52:59.610
every time he gets into office the

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:01.740
[ __ ] money comes in like crazy and

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:03.150
when she leaves it dips and then when

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:04.710
she finally lost it like totally

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:06.480
plummeted Trump finally [ __ ] put the

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.830
nail in the coffin I do

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:10.290
I mean it's a whole edit but they're

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:11.430
like apparently a bunch of people are

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:12.660
coming through or coming forward and

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.760
being like yeah like we [ __ ] around

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.250
so what I'm hoping is that we can kind

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:19.020
of capitalize for the patreon you know

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.070
if there's people out there and don't

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:37.180
if they were if our founding fathers

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:38.380

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.330
pretty sick now yeah I love that

00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:42.580

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.920
they used to found it on a revolution of

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.340
violent revolutions like not even close

00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:53.320

[ __ ] a couple of white guys joining

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.450
the cause dude wasn't his [ __ ]

01:01:07.450 --> 01:01:09.220
light-skinned did this guy looks like he

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:10.720
was like blond hair he literally looks

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.340
like he's in like oh god that's a

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.500
[ __ ] yeah do you live to two bolts on

01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:21.340
wrong room you guys got me the wrong

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.290

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.310
those guys I don't know what this is but

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:29.530
these guys Isis is for sure the losing

01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:31.900
team right now yeah they put up a

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.970
[ __ ] wild ass fight though yeah man I

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:35.920
mean they got barking they never really

uh they've never really everything ever

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.870
since Paris they really never did

01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:42.610
anything but when they went up and got

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:45.460
that there's cartoonists no they shot up

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.710
Paris attacks they shot them Bulls

01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:48.030
didn't

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:49.500
attack of cartoonists and powers did

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.690
Charlie Hebdo yeah and then they came

01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:53.580
out with a and they the Paris attacks

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:55.260
we got the cartoons that you did general

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.730
was like still we shut down the cartoons

01:01:56.730 --> 01:02:01.020
I'll get to this a little bit lacking

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:05.060
military tactical rock concert cool [ __ ]

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:10.530
attack cool [ __ ] a second way to war on

01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:12.720
cartoons and music yeah awesome dude

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.060
such a sick all right we got a cartoon

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:16.500
shut down let's go down like how about

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.940
the bridge make the bridge can stay for

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:19.860
now attack the rock music okay well the

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.630
the bridge would be a very important

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:23.640
strategic position for us general is it

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:29.250
nah cartoons and music are you sure yes

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:31.680
a lot wills it dude as a [ __ ] dude I

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.280
uh my latest audio audiobook right now

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.950
is um it's about IQ and how like this

01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:39.330
whole country's just built all the

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:41.310
singing technically theories that it's

01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:44.040
an IQ meritocracy this guy argues like

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.440
not a good idea to build a whole society

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.740
of IQ and but this guy came under fire

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:52.710
charles murray he came under fire way

01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:55.230
back when because he was doing studies

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.780
about race and IQ yeah I remember this

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.690
guy yes his teacher's aide got like hit

01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:02.160
in the face and sent to the hospital he

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.550
was on he fasted he was on roadies was

01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:06.900
he on regular stand yeah he was on Sam

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:07.860
Harris I'm sure he probably was on

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.600
roadies too oh well you know what it was

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.800
cuz the same here and maybe I was

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.510
listening to it on sam Harris yeah you

01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:14.280
might even on Rosi I forget but

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.110
basically they did studies and you know

01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:17.790
whether they're valid who knows but they

01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:20.760
did study saying that only race and IQ

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.780
and they're basically saying that like

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:24.360
Asian dudes had like the Chinese one

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.000
standard deviation higher 15 points and

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.830
white dudes and white Jews were one

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:30.360
standard deviation higher than black

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.850
dudes on these tests but they're saying

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.770
like on the individual level you don't

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:36.120
have to worry about it like because it's

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.010
there's so much overlap with in there

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:39.660
there's they're like this is aggregate

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.340
data and they're also saying like

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:42.780
people's IQs have been growing steadily

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:44.130
so they're saying like white people had

01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:45.420
more time basically to be like

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.740
unfettered and learned and all that

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.140
stuff so it's this this guy is like dude

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.340
these are what the [ __ ] studies found

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:52.110
all I'm saying is we shouldn't build

01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:54.060
[ __ ] like a whole society around this

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:55.680
cuz is inherently unfair according to

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.430
these huge tests

01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:58.050
dude people attacked him like you're

01:03:58.050 --> 01:03:59.600
[ __ ] races yeah

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.400
but here's the thing here's what spud

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.720
brought up it's a good point it's like

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.910
hey man if you start talking about dick

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:06.950
size nobody's [ __ ] calling anyone a

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:08.600
racist like it you know what I mean so

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.030
it's like well that's easy for spot he's

01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:12.350
like the Neil deGrasse Tyson the white

01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:16.850
dudes dicks Tyson is the smartest this

01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:19.700
smart black man's a neil degrasse white

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:24.260
dude when it comes to dicks dude I mean

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.850
I'm sure Neil deGrasse Tyson super-smart

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:27.290
but like you can just talk about outer

01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:28.910
space and make [ __ ] off of people like

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:31.280
wow really is that like yeah dudes

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.050
pretty crazy you wonder how far away the

01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:37.220
Sun is if you put a baseball at the top

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:38.720
of the Empire State Building I mean

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.130
they'll be tight of people like the best

01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:41.600
people at math are like all right we're

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.130
obviously the best people in math no one

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:44.450
has any any of the [ __ ] we're talking

01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:45.800
about let's just combine letters with

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.060
numbers and just trick people into

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.010
thinking this is real meanwhile geniuses

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.510
like me are in high school like none of

01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:51.380
this makes sense

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:53.150
yeah you figured the fact that I knew

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:56.900
algebra is fake tested you sit there and

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.280
I'm really good at algebra or the real

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.040
mathematicians way everyone knows the

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.960
times tables and long division or math

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.130
ends and I'm struggling with long

01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:08.930
divisions but I'm stable as I could get

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:10.880
I've ever raced to love getting to the

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.680
end of that long division problem find

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:15.130
out like remainder three [ __ ] yeah dude

01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:17.720
what's next and the teacher big totally

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:27.110
wrong and that a like multiplication

01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:31.340
that's like there's a procedure that all

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.230
you have to do is follow it every like I

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:34.450
would [ __ ] it up

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:38.720
every single time oh [ __ ] it up good I

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.870
could I like for the life of me as long

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:43.460
as I've been alive and they start

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.380
teaching me math it's like you know

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:47.150
times tables give me them to memorize

01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:48.980
I'll memorize them division memorized

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:50.870
soon as like all right you can't do

01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:52.220
these numbers in your head here's how

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.840
you do this and carry it out I'd just be

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.480
like oh god oh god I start I start dude

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:57.740
all the numbers get scrambled I have

01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:59.870
shitty handwriting so like I'm like is

01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:01.610
this in this column here and I'm like

01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:03.080
gonna forget and see how it goes and I'm

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.690
like I think this is a [ __ ] hated it

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:06.710
man yeah math sucks

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:09.230
[ __ ] that [ __ ] sucks I was good at

01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:13.010
geometry but not good I was horrible

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:14.600
I was horrible at every form of math

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:18.080
dude he like seventh grade divorce em I

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.750
come to all the math came out of me all

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:22.340
the numbers shot out of it when they hit

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:27.500
me with sine cosine tangent have any fun

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.880
when you just said to me do but if you

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.670
say it again I'll [ __ ] you up cosine I

01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:33.320
don't like it the curve do you remember

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.150
the foil method that's where I stopped

01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:39.500
soil first outer inner last they start

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.300
adding pressure in there and there's

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.560
different why are we even worried about

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.420
that my whole thing is I'm I'm gonna

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:45.740
[ __ ] multiply and divide by whatever

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:46.700
the [ __ ] I want dude

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.650
yeah you can [ __ ] know what I told my

01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:50.290
math teacher when I was in grade school

01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:52.790
no I said literally I said look all I

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:56.020
need to do is know how to count my money

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.780
you actually said that that's [ __ ]

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.430
awesome I was like all I need to do is

be able to count money oh yeah if I do

01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:04.460
the math that I can count my money I'm

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:06.290
fine and the lady was just like you need

01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:07.250
to learn how to do this I'm like we're

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:08.750
getting calculated so sick you

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:12.160
definitely heard that orange instructor

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.380
say that cuz he was also [ __ ] he was

01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:17.600
it he was on a backhoe you know what I

told my teacher I said this [ __ ] all I

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:22.220
need to do is count money that's our

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.530
need to learn how to do it I'll be fine

01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:25.790
you're [ __ ] ass showed up to school

01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:30.070
like I need money

that's a proverb in the McCusker that's

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:37.609
my dad's property wanna talk to me about

01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:40.070
math I don't need math by debt one dad's

01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:42.260
profit my one day my dad's one proverb

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:45.020
is a life's like a [ __ ] life's a [ __ ]

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.490
sandwich the more bread you have less

01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:49.190
[ __ ] you have to eat so that's the [ __ ]

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:51.050
out sound the trash yard I was just like

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:52.760
[ __ ] yeah dude [ __ ] school dude I'm

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:54.890
gonna be a trash man she had rules dude

01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:56.119
I would go down there when I was younger

01:07:56.119 --> 01:07:58.280
and it was like I would just [ __ ]

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.800
shoot rats and like they would like grab

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.570
a TV with a machine and drop it from

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:04.250
real high and I'd be like [ __ ] yeah dude

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:12.500
rules schools gay the thrown TVs

literally go to it was a transfer

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:16.190
station warehouse and it's in the if

01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:17.630
it's dark you go there early in the

01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:19.220
morning hit the [ __ ] lights and it's

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.219
just a [ __ ] rat faster you got a gun

01:08:21.219 --> 01:08:23.859
yours [ __ ] light and rats up

01:08:23.859 --> 01:08:25.630
who they used to keep it on the toilet

01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:27.580
they should keep a nine-millimeter on

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.810
the back of the toilets and when you're

01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:32.149
taking a [ __ ] if you keep the door open

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:35.639
[Laughter]

01:08:35.639 --> 01:08:38.469
and then like I would just ride around

01:08:38.469 --> 01:08:40.029
the truck if I'd ride around the trash

01:08:40.029 --> 01:08:41.230
truck with my dad and then let you'd

01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:42.969
hear the CB radio and it was I just

01:08:42.969 --> 01:08:45.130
learned all the racial slurs like I was

01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:46.569

the trash truck just here and everything

01:08:51.369 --> 01:08:53.350
was just like I mean that's the world of

01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:55.810
the trash man that the average person

01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:57.940
sees the trash man is like what the [ __ ]

01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:58.630

01:08:58.630 --> 01:09:03.609
well here you have it yeah shoot rats I

01:09:03.609 --> 01:09:05.409
would sit in the trash truck and drive

01:09:05.409 --> 01:09:06.580
around with my dad and he would eat

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:08.770
peanut M&Ms and bite the chocolate off

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.409
and hand me the peanuts I think that's a

01:09:11.409 --> 01:09:12.040
nice memory

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.480

Frank's house and then somebody said it

01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:21.580
young age like not bring up anything

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.989

Alien movie incubation things and just a

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:14.130
gay dude reaches through with one of

01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:16.950
those like biological like clothes and

01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:18.420
it's just projecting a hologram of a

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.010

the blueprint for every episode it's

01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:47.940
like I say all bad at a shitty weekend I

01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:51.420

01:15:57.630 --> 01:15:59.990
sex

01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:10.890
the VW symbol if you spin it real fast

01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:16.160
becomes a sois it does not it does dude

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:24.030
oversight did they forget do they not

know they might not have known it might

01:16:25.710 --> 01:16:27.210
have been they definitely weren't in on

01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:27.510

years later you're gonna Chuck a little

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.500
Nazi symbol on there not 20 years later

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:50.310
they had it really change the symbol

01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:52.770
yeah the Volkswagen vote yeah it's like

01:16:52.770 --> 01:16:55.050
the people's car the Volkswagen yeah

01:16:55.050 --> 01:16:57.270
dude check out the video there's a video

01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:59.370
where they there's a video out they spin

01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:00.810
it and dude it just literally turns and

01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:02.160
you could see how it would become that

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.720
so I give you a tagine unit spinner of a

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.150
Volkswagen symbol yes

01:17:06.150 --> 01:17:07.740
yeah the necklace of the junior spinner

01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:08.520
yelps spinning

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.800
yep and it would be so I saw so I saw

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.420
the video then I saw one drive-by and I

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.650
was trying to assess the tires with the

01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:18.390
tire shop but you have it on a lift you

01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:22.440
can spin it and probably see it just

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.370
like in the only look at is not right

01:17:26.370 --> 01:17:28.920
dude the own lookout don't fall in these

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.720
people are so brave I I want to see

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.370
someone to demonstrate Illuminati's just

01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:33.900
brazenly throwing it in our face no I

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.920
think it might've been something they

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.480
set up where people never realized and

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.620
now people are like oh [ __ ] when you

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.180
spin if you spin it at the right speed

01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:41.400
it actually does look like a it could be

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.110
like kind of coincidental or it could

01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:45.120
have been like check out the six there

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.830
like check this out spawning it was like

01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:48.780
ancient aliens like the Nazis infused

01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:50.160
that technology into it they're like

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.860
we're not gonna tell anyone but the

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.630
Volkswagen symbol is actually a secret

01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:57.720
secret swastika maybe they could it

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:58.800
could have been something that like the

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:00.930
original logo designer was like check

01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:02.670
this out back when like Nazism was like

01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:07.230
hot it's [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah just

01:18:07.230 --> 01:18:08.850
only brought it up at one presentation

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.170
though and then they no one ever

01:18:10.170 --> 01:18:11.580
remembered maybe only like two founders

01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:13.410
saw it and then the [ __ ] everything

01:18:13.410 --> 01:18:14.550
happened they're like we're not changing

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:17.070
the symbol and then some [ __ ] lone

01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:20.370
youtuber as I check it out it could be

01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:25.380
fake checks out hey exactly what do we

01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:27.630
add time was our 18 I'm sorry I've

01:18:27.630 --> 01:18:30.480
checking out there yeah I'm [ __ ] big

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.950
time checking out dude

01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:34.110
I suck we're done I just do that thing

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:35.970
about uh well not checking out I was

01:18:35.970 --> 01:18:37.470
just curious as to where we were and now

01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:40.320
we're now I knew we were this is bonus

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:43.200
time dude this was the IQ thing was cool

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.090
I feel better now but the baguette I was

01:18:45.090 --> 01:18:48.240
I was asleep before you got here ten

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.570
minutes took a 10-minute nap after not

01:18:51.570 --> 01:18:53.400
even enough dude I was so excited I was

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.110
like I gotta lay down I can't wait what

01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:57.300
do you think about the IQ dude yeah I

01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:58.650
think that makes perfect sense I don't

01:18:58.650 --> 01:18:59.730
think there's anything wrong with saying

01:18:59.730 --> 01:19:02.760
that this guy's wrong protested of

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.700
course he is this guy he's like these

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.290
are the tests if anyone even said like

01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:09.030
if anyone has tests that prove otherwise

01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:10.800
what would love to see him he's like all

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.330
I'm saying is this is what's going on

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:14.310
and this is what we're basing we're

01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:15.930
running a meritocracy that's based off

01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:18.570
of IQ and it's like it and then do you

01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:20.820
have college now or high IQ people find

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:21.730
each other

01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:23.500
kids and segregate themselves more from

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.239
the population it's like it's just it's

01:19:25.239 --> 01:19:26.680
bad it's as bad thing people got to

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.970
figure out ways to reorganize everything

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:30.400
yeah [ __ ] racist he's like I'm not

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.570
saying that like if you're black you're

01:19:31.570 --> 01:19:32.890
dumber than all white people's there's a

01:19:32.890 --> 01:19:34.900
huge huge overlap on the individual

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:36.160
scale where it's not like a predictor

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.230
individually but he was like it's

01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:39.640

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.200

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.000
