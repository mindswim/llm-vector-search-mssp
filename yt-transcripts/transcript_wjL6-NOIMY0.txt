WEBVTT

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.129
I'm here today with my [ __ ] dog

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.859
I am under a blanket to ensure sound

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.509
quality because this is my first time

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.580
using zoom audio and I should be using a

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.650
headphone some sort or some sort of

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.590
microphone but I'm not yeah so the good

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.240
news is that that blanket will protect

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.680
you against Corona as well

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.500
true safe yeah that's true I kirlyam

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.510
I've never felt safer with a blanket

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.880
before but it might have been another

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.500
time private meetings listen man I'm in

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.739
my basement again I mean like I don't

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.540
know if I'm coming at it this time

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.250
things are getting pretty sketchy out

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.590
there yeah so what's up you said you got

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.120
you said you got a bit of the in on the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.739
coronavirus or the rest of us are

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.300
dependent on the news and you know I

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.670
don't know I'm in the trenches man I'm

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.039
from Lyons so you know way because if

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.090
Brogan put that why don't you talk about

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.570
that Rogan put that one out yesterday

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.899
yeah nearly that freaked everybody out

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.350
yeah I think I may have been an alarmist

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.369
Michael osterholm is a an epidemiologist

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.710
and has an interest in getting people

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.750
worried right that's he's selling books

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.290
but I don't think it's far off to start

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.720
you know I would just offer a bit of a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.670
disclaimer so it would be important if

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.189
you have concerns to talk to your doctor

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.600
contact the Public Health Unit but yeah

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.570
the contrast that that I would offer to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.509
you no discussion of big numbers and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.930
sort of munching bats is the chaos in

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.390
the front in the front lines right so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.040
these these epidemiologists and ID docs

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.189
and they're sort of ivory towers that's

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.170
not to say that some of them are

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.740
swapping people but you know aren't

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.009
having first first hand experience first

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.090
line exposure and you know she's getting

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.880
a bit scary I want to be under a blanket

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.880
I want to be in a basement yeah so what

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.090
so what uh what do you what like what

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.649
kind of what would you know about the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.149
coronavirus that maybe people don't know

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.420
or is that do you know stuff about it

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.459
sure I mean long and short it's a it's a

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.720
SARS virus similar to the 2003 pandemic

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.739
but this one seems it has a higher full

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.010
velocity so they there's this sort of

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.280
esoteric value called R naught and that

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.180
number represents the individuals that

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.800
can be infected by a contact so for

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.459
example if the R naught value is 3 an

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.680
infected person tends to on average in

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.709
fact three others okay so for different

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.610
reasons

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.269
this this bug is more aggressive it's

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.640
it's more difficult to contain the the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.610
number of people that require

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.100
hospitalization is higher and that's

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.780
that's sort of the crux of the problem

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.000
is the the overburdening of intensive

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.769
cares emergency departments which are

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.870
you know working at beyond capacity and

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.549
we've got these old folks with the

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.120
corona on vents and we're having more

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.940
difficulty addressing other sick people

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.370
they're on like ventilation [ __ ] yeah so

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.780
roughly you know the population that's

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.790
infected maybe 20% will end up

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.030
hospitalized

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.120
okay so 80% you know they're the the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.430
verbiage that's used like we'll have

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.820
mild symptoms but that's from China and

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.980
they're tough [ __ ] and mild

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.840
symptoms you know can include things

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.829
like pneumonia

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.780
being sort of completely knocked out

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.840
right and then there's maybe a fifth

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.510
even that end up at hospital and the

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.000
data from Wu hen suggests that of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.079
hospitalized patients up to 50% of them

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.190
will die sort of the mortality rate for

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.580
for all comers and it varies by by

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.900
country but in what's sort of

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.139
interesting so the the

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.319
the the best news is out of South Korea

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.680
where they're quoting 0.5% but what's

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.210
sort of concerning for me is Italy so

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.219
Italy obviously is a you know

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:42.060
industrious westernized nation Lombardi

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.729
is the Providence where the things are

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.770
most severe and they're quoting numbers

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.830
of like like six percent five six

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.979
percent so quite a range yeah it's

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.680
pretty nasty so that's that's worse than

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.580
Spanish flu for example yeah I mean what

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.169
was that it's no what was the bubonic

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.539
was the bubonic plague like a 30 percent

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.060
er yes and I mean of course you know

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.909
that's when we were you know sitting in

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.189
our own [ __ ] yeah yeah it was a

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.819
different story but even like so like

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.460
Spanish flu the demographics were a bit

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.840
worse in that the folks that died from

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.740
Spanish flu tended to be younger because

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.629
it was related to sort of an over

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.330
response of the the immune system or a

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.509
cytokine storm whereas this is this

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.449
tends to be wiping out geezers so the

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.300
majority of people dying are over the

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.750
age of 60 does not explain that again

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.879
Spanish flu is ramping up people's

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:47.219
immune systems too hard yeah it's and

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.319
that's that's the mechanism so the idea

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:54.719
is in fact people are more likely to die

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:58.439
when the the viral titers that is the

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.710
number of these [ __ ] in our blood

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.729
starts to drop off and so the the

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.370
thought is is that your your body which

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.939
is responding usually to necrotic cells

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:15.110
in the lung epithelial cells in the lung

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:22.259
creates a so called a RDS which floods

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.770
your lungs with with fluid and you is

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.110
sort of drowned on your own [ __ ] puss

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.969
it's pretty nasty way to go

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.969
so the and fight that and then the

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:34.589
mechanisms to fight it off end up

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:37.199
killing you because it's so strong yeah

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.730
that's the idea

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.760
a RDS or acute respiratory distress

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.790
syndrome is end-stage for the majority

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.630
of people dying of Corona and that's why

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.420
everyone is being vented right so in

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.040
terms of criteria that we're using for a

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.840
hospitalization when they when they

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.430
start to to desolder lose oxygen in

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.070
their blood they're going to end up in

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.190
these high acuity settings and the

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.000
capacity is so limited so you know in a

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.810
reasonable you know a midsize town

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.480
wherever the [ __ ] I might be let's say

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.720
that we have you know a hundred vents

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.550
and and the issue is is that those can

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.980
become saturated so quickly right so

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:28.620
they the sort of horrifying narratives

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:34.500
out of Italy our hospitals with that our

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.780
triaging people pastes on their [ __ ]

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.420
age so it's like save the women and

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.580
children you old [ __ ] are gonna die

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.620
in the hallway and that's not that's not

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.440
an exaggeration so like the geezers are

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.420
just so it's basically geezer men it's

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.040
like Titanic status we're like the only

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.680
so many ventilators and the geezers the

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.020
Geezer men they're just kind of like you

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.460
know going down we're going down with

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.990
the ship damn yes exactly play the

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.500
violin I mean it's not funny I mean if

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.210
you can go it's a good moment and terms

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.370
with a geezer lifetime be able to like

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.800
stoic Lee died in your 60s that's not a

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.890
bad way out nah man and and you can

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.460
exactly like they you know sort of the

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.910
most heroic people right now are the you

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.890
know the frontline workers and these and

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.960
these older folks that are that are

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.440
taking taking the hit and sort of making

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.740
selfless decisions it's not so I can

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.510
just just to cut the mustard it's not

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.190
[ __ ] you know there's there's a lot

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.450
of Korona think and being like that's

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.220
[ __ ] [ __ ] the flu killed a hundred

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:38.849
thousand people

00:08:38.849 --> 00:08:41.190
Crona killed what like three thousand

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.800
this is nonsense yeah well I mean flu

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.070
seasonal flu so influenza A and B tend

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.600
to kill about like you know on the order

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.260
of 40 to $70,000 $50,000

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.560
thirty thousand people in a given year

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.300
so yes we're you know recording maybe

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.790
you know five thousand and that's likely

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.890
underreported right now but this is

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.950
early days brother the shit's the shit's

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.680
not even hit the fan yet like this you

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.530
know this others there's optimism that a

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.950
warm respiratory epithelium is less

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.580
susceptible to infection yeah well the

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.820
idea is that your lung lining is less

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.390
likely to get infected by virus in the

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.610
warmer weather and that's why you know

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:32.910
the season is oftentimes in the colder

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.850
months but you know for example stars

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.700
like MERS which is a SARS virus a

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.010
related virus and that's the Middle

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:47.100
Eastern respiratory virus is year-round

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.130
in the [ __ ] deserts and this [ __ ] is

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.000
literally like camels coughing on people

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.860
spreading it yeah yeah global warming is

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.990
saving us from coronavirus which is

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:14.580
pretty tight I guess yeah big deal you

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.140
listen to the Rogen one yesterday and

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.820
you you know a lot of people are saying

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.950
you know it's kind of like oh they're

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.110
just hyping this up so you're you know

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.690
this isn't some like well first of all I

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:25.830
don't know if you want to get on to this

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.330
but there's a lot of people there's some

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.640
people I know claiming that it's a it's

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.590
been like created like this virus it's

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.480
synthetic in some ways is that you

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.500
believe that's true at all or do you

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.660
think this is just a super boy yeah I

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.310
mean so I don't pretend to be an expert

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.410
as relates to that but I it's been

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.020
debunked it's not it's yeah it's not

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.180
it's it's not a thing so I mean there's

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.910
a there's two level for virology labs

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.000
that they were worried about one is in

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.530
Winnipeg and one is actually in Wuhan

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.660
which is sort of the suspicious feature

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.250
and they were especially

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.800
paranoid about a protein sequence that

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.370
is very closely analogous to something

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.390
found in HIV but they've done you know

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.390
they you know to some extent you have to

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.060
trust the science there so from

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.230
everything that I've read there's

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.670
there's no evidence that this is

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.250
man-made and probably as it's almost

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.020
like a like Huber it's almost sort of

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.650
the the humans do not have the ability

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.900
or the capabilities to craft such an

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.630
exquisite [ __ ] killing this machine

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.840
like it this thing is so evil dude that

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.470
you know you can't even dream of you

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.950
can't think this up in a lab fair enough

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.340
I mean I I like to I looked into gay

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.140
frogs you know what I mean like I like

00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:01.800
to do you have yet so we would be like

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.960
you know that makes sense that it would

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.750
be like 90 times more complicated than

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.520
the most complicated computer program to

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.920
try to engineer a virus that would

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.080
spread rapidly and only kill geezers and

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.610
you know it does I hear what you're

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.950
saying it seems to be they'll be kind of

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.570
like you were saying who'd ristic to

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.550
think like us humans could could or at

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:21.840
the point again I don't know where bio

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.310
weapons are currently but okay so

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.810
basically the in in terms of the Rogen

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.060
episode do you feel like they were

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.130
spot-on with that or user stuff that you

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.630
heard that was kind of conflicting or

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.880
what did you think well that's the thing

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.700
you know I'm sure like I I'm sure I'm

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.660
gonna put my foot in my mouth at some

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.410
point but you know like yeah it's

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.500
important to listen to these experts and

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.850
but there was some things like right off

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.360
the top that are discrepant from what

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.920
we're being taught and what we're being

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.590
counseled around and that is importantly

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.770
like the airborne nature of the virus so

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.170
this guy was going like osterholm was

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.080
going on about you know in 95 switcher

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.410
leg respirator masks that are designed

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:15.050
to protect against airborne viruses i

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:19.050
the the data you know and all the guide

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:23.089
and suggest that droplet precautions are

00:13:23.089 --> 00:13:26.880
sufficient and in fact you know there's

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.800
no evidence that this is airborne unlike

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.950
you know for example measles or other

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:37.380
more virulent or other more airborne

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.130
contagions contagious viruses so that

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.560
was a bit funky to be honest like a you

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.000
know obviously it doesn't discredit him

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.640
he has a crazy resume and has done a

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.110
whole lot of [ __ ] that being said I

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.959
don't know that he's not an MD not give

00:13:51.959 --> 00:13:54.660
a [ __ ] but what is he then he's a virus

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.240
detected that's all yeah he's got a

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.200
degree in virus detection no I think

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.730
he's like he's like an epidemiologist

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:07.079
I'm sure he has a PhD but it's just

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:09.000
interesting and you it's it's you know

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.310
what it is it's unsettling because it's

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.200
like what the [ __ ] like why is this

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.230
world expert this is this is basic [ __ ]

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.750
like you know biology 101 is a

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.000
discussion of droplet spread airborne

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.970
spread because that dictates the type of

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.380
personal protective equipment that you

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.839
use in interacting with patients and you

00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:33.360
know this is basic stuff so the fact

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:38.360
that this world expert doesn't have a

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.890
view that's in line with with like a

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.360
local authority for example is

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.850
disconcerting and and that's what I

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.860
think is jarring and again it's not

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.589
meant to be it's not meant to be

00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:51.810
alarmist or anything like this but no

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.279
one knows what the [ __ ] going on man

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:58.380
like yeah they think it's not airborne

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.730
you're saying though you think it's more

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:00.990
of like like it's like it being like a

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.930
sneeze break off spread contagion yeah

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.699
you got it so that's exactly right so

00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:08.550
the the corona viruses are these [ __ ]

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.959
as far as as far as Mike microbes go or

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:15.839
these are these massive viruses and just

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:18.870
by virtue of their size they you know

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:24.420
they quote like six meters of spread via

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.670
droplets and there's not a whole lot of

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:30.660
evidence for so-called fomites spread

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.150
which is like the virus serve

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.300
for a long time on on a service or

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.100
anything like that but yeah like you

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.680
know it's as far as as far as I'm aware

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.490
there's there's no concerns around

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.140
airborne spread so that was like oh this

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.630
is some basic [ __ ] that is inconsistent

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.110
with with certain like absolutely

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.760
inconsistent with with local guidelines

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.500
local teaching and it throws you off so

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.310
you start like questioning any sort of

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.020
expert guidelines and as a person the

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.290
public especially when you see all of

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.800
these you know conflicting people that

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.630
are trying to de-escalate things and

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.560
then people that are a little more

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.780
alarmist you're like who you believe

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.370
right like I can't imagine being

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:27.120
paranoid schizophrenic right now yeah I

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.790
mean that's again I am I myah

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.920
like whenever stuff like this happens my

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.720
natural reaction is like oh this is all

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.450
[ __ ] we had SARS we had you know

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.890
whatever we had like two or three of

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.990
these things and I can remember you know

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.300
it's always been you know I felt fine

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.250
not jinxing myself this comes and goes

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.130
and I'm like that was weird

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.770
this is like so is this like a new flu

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.540
we have to contend with they're thinking

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.030
or just potentially yeah well hopefully

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.250
not but like they're they're quoting

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.750
kind of six to twelve months so we're

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.220
gonna be dealing with this and I mean

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.910
that's the thing it like public panic is

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.550
obviously contributing but Matt look at

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.920
your [ __ ] portfolio look at not that

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.589
I'm kind of ribbing you a little bit

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.240
look at your investments they're like

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.250
you're you know like everything is you

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.370
know markets drops no on the order of

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.670
like seven ten percent so it's people

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.209
are this is this is this is next-level

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:26.550
shit's hit the fan especially with China

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.530
being affected which is the you know the

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.830
supply chain for you know like my Amazon

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.830
orders are [ __ ] delayed what yeah I'm

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.590
out it's gonna be a lump of coal and the

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:42.990
Happy Meals dude yeah my luckily I don't

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:44.850
have any stocks yet I'm still steaming

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:46.020
on himself

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.940
you know why maybe all the geezers will

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.620
be going obvious by I'm cheap and that's

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.780
well now's the time and make your move

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.770
that's true right might I might take you

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.470
up on that yeah well you know to get

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.460
back to the means of spread though like

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.960
that's probably what's the most

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:09.059
important discussion right now is social

00:18:09.059 --> 00:18:11.580
distancing and that's why I'm gonna stay

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.470
in my basement so the idea is if you

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.429
give yourself a 2 meter perimeter you

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:19.470
should be alright well oh really

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.960
yeah you're gonna be fine yeah I'm in a

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.610
high school right now and I went to the

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.350
high school Monday right I'm teaching a

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.790
grade school and a high school or

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.730
whatever doing counseling and uh yeah I

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.710
just for you knows I just had a kid I'm

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.620
like I'm gonna take off you know I can

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.730
still get stuff done for the podcast

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.620
which is cool too so it's kind of like

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.540
I'm kind of you know cashing in on that

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.000
but I am kind of bugged out I'm like I

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.500
don't know if I'm like you know sitting

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.390
in it what they talk about I'm Rogan was

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.610
like sitting in shared air systems where

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.100
they're just cycling air you know yeah I

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.679
don't I don't know if I buy that man you

00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:54.510
don't buy that I don't know if I buy it

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.070
I don't know where that's coming like

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.550
obviously it you know this guy is an

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.340
authority but I haven't heard a whole

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.429
lot about that in particular but yeah I

00:19:05.429 --> 00:19:07.920
mean they're starting to shut schools

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.070
down I don't know what's going on in

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.620
Pennsylvania but Montgomery Kay yeah

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.750
Pennsylvania they got Montgomery County

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.070
I think they closed schools I don't know

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.290
if Philadelphia did yet I was at a place

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.720
and someone uh someone said like they

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.220
knew someone that had it so they had to

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.750
go quarantined they had to go home they

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.090
couldn't be around anyone so I just I

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.770
just proactively quarantined myself I'm

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.030
like you know I don't I don't want to be

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.580
around the [ __ ]

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.649
I heard that oh so you're so you're

00:19:33.649 --> 00:19:36.499
you're not going into a school is then

00:19:36.499 --> 00:19:38.090
I'm gonna say I'm gonna give it a week

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.419
you know I don't see what else comes out

00:19:41.419 --> 00:19:43.549
and again I'm conveniently building a

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:45.799
studio right now so when it's a good

00:19:45.799 --> 00:19:48.889
time yeah this is actually this is good

00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:51.999
I can broadcast ended days from here

00:19:51.999 --> 00:19:54.919
long so like a long shot there's that

00:19:54.919 --> 00:19:56.360
that's what's scary about it everyone's

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.860
like you know when people say like oh

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.539
you know it's only killed a thousand

00:19:59.539 --> 00:20:01.580
people but there's also in terms of the

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.730
kill rate there's a ton of cases up here

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.379
they think are not being reported so

00:20:06.379 --> 00:20:09.220
that rate could drop pretty severely

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.159
yeah well you know so a couple of things

00:20:13.159 --> 00:20:16.580
to that like one the [ __ ] this is

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.239
hilarious

00:20:17.239 --> 00:20:20.149
the standard that we're using it's

00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:21.320
[ __ ] world

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.799
Oh meters dot info so this is the the

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:27.739
gold standard for tracking global deaths

00:20:27.739 --> 00:20:30.470
like what the [ __ ] like there's no you

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.690
know World Health Organization and

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.059
Association to my knowledge is just some

00:20:35.059 --> 00:20:38.600
random [ __ ] like website but that's

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.749
what yeah that's public exactly it's

00:20:41.749 --> 00:20:45.200
like a Steve's or suddenly no idea it's

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.809
its summary and that's what they the

00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:49.820
demonologist are referring to public

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.190
health are referring to so just to you

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.299
know that's sort of highlights how

00:20:53.299 --> 00:20:55.700
shitty the data collection probably is

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.739
to start

00:20:56.739 --> 00:20:59.299
so we're quoting you know maybe maybe

00:20:59.299 --> 00:21:03.529
5,000 deaths so far and this is super

00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:08.509
super early days right yeah and if it if

00:21:08.509 --> 00:21:12.019
it continues to spread the the deaths

00:21:12.019 --> 00:21:16.730
are proportionate with the ICU capacity

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.249
of the affected nations so for example

00:21:19.249 --> 00:21:22.220
you know South Korea has got their epic

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.539
and they've they've got a really good

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:30.039
health care infrastructure superior to

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:32.960
Italy so that's why everyone was so

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.330
relieved oh yeah you know they're doing

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.639
a really good screening program the case

00:21:37.639 --> 00:21:41.720
fatality is 0.5% and then Italy which is

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.080
still a decent country

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.580
from from an infrastructure perspective

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.380
you know they're they're looking at like

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.010
6% or worse so it's it's proportionate

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:54.940
with your ability to manage it the the

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.049
world economy is getting [ __ ] the

00:21:58.049 --> 00:22:02.350
hospitals are overrun I'm scared I'm

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.919
gonna start swabbing myself potentially

00:22:04.919 --> 00:22:11.890
it's where we all are panicking and I'll

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.059
have yourself what do you mean what do

00:22:13.059 --> 00:22:15.580
you how do you do that you know it was

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.500
so the there's two ways the gold

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.919
standard is a nasopharyngeal swab which

00:22:20.919 --> 00:22:23.019
is like super uncomfortable it's like

00:22:23.019 --> 00:22:25.659
you know I used to like floss or can you

00:22:25.659 --> 00:22:28.210
floss your nose with spaghetti hell no

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.830
dude I went to that your nose throat guy

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.059
and he stuck something up my nose I

00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:32.559
freaked out I don't like it at all oh

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:33.789
well you're [ __ ] then

00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:38.440
so yeah they left though they can do an

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.500
oropharyngeal swab so like a at the back

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.679
of the throat a little less sensitive

00:22:44.679 --> 00:22:46.659
but that's the that's the way that we're

00:22:46.659 --> 00:22:49.840
we're screening folks at this time but I

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.159
I don't like the idea of these like how

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:56.679
are we gonna set up a community

00:22:56.679 --> 00:22:59.169
assessment so are we gonna have a bunch

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:02.889
of suspicious people that you know with

00:23:02.889 --> 00:23:05.200
whom we who we suspect might have the

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.539
illness sitting in a [ __ ] crowded

00:23:07.539 --> 00:23:10.179
waiting room you know coughing on each

00:23:10.179 --> 00:23:13.260
other or are we gonna adopt some

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.279
programs that have been used in like

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:18.519
Germany and elsewhere where they have

00:23:18.519 --> 00:23:21.460
like a drive-through like straight up

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.830
like you know how can I take your order

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:27.100
you roll down the window they swab you

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.330
and you pick up your results and have a

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:32.039
nice day

00:23:32.039 --> 00:23:34.299
yeah it seems like more of the move than

00:23:34.299 --> 00:23:36.100
putting someone in a waiting room but

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.980
just to recap so the the real the real

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.260
problem is the inability to handle it

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.570
it's a very containable disease it's

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.309
just if you there's just the numbers

00:23:45.309 --> 00:23:47.919
that are messing people up numbers are

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:49.389
messing people up yeah there's a there's

00:23:49.389 --> 00:23:55.630
a really the the the our health care

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:56.450
system

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.880
is easily saturated you know what I mean

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.620
like we're constantly working at like

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.100
almost 100% capacity so we don't have

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.180
resources we can't mobilize resources

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.960
like a you know a semi sort of

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.450
dictatorship like like China where we

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:18.590
can be like [ __ ] you stay at home don't

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.780
spread this so there are countries you

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.660
know Israel for example we're all

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.170
returning travelers are at home two

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.920
weeks you know take some time off spend

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.240
some time with your kids play video

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.640
games two weeks suck it up most like

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.720
like CDC level guidelines right now or

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.710
travelers who are returning from

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.630
affected regions which is you know which

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.740
changes on a daily basis and who have

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.960
even the sniffles that means two weeks

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:59.870
at home yeah hunker down yeah even if

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.160
you just get a cold during this time

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.950
it's like that's two weeks two weeks if

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.780
you've if you have if you've had travel

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.240
but a you know what like we don't know

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.100
there's no data in the States in terms

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.560
of community spreads you guys already

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.860
have number of case reports California

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.350
or Washington state of

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.030
community spread so that isn't people

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.840
that have no travel history but our swab

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.540
positive I mean this is a kind of weird

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.610
question but like we gonna have to stop

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.270
like chilling with animals or something

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:34.910
dude I this is it your that's a loaded

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.910
question man you're you're absolutely

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.550
right we we have got to stop munching

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.790
bats yeah so that was munch has that

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.080
been verified in any official capacity

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.610
because they're really fighting that

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.310
narrative right now no they're it's so

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.870
they're it's that and then I forget what

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.310
the other [ __ ] is called there's like

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.960
this armadillo

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.950
other species that is also on these you

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:02.550
know so-called wet markets and Wuhan so

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.110
it was it was almost certainly one of

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:07.040
the two either a bat muncher or a

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:14.490
slipper yeah bat muncher Dillo slipper

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.640
one of the two men that's that's that's

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.820
agent zero if you are like if you're

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.800
just half the much of bat like is there

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.420
a way to boil it or like if you're gonna

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:34.320
like scoop out I'm not an expert on bad

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.510
preparation but really like you know and

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:40.980
like a really formal set of guidelines

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.970
you know hand washing instructions this

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.270
is how you safely prepared bath damn it

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.210
you know so we can show our dog we can

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:52.740
for now chill with our dogs you just

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.530
can't munch any kind of creepy creatures

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.530
ya don't stay away from stay away from

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:02.010
bats stay away from those armadillo

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.990
things don't look at camel in its face

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:10.710
these are the main precautions yeah and

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.800
and China is going to China's gonna as I

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.540
think it's crack is cracking down or

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.230
House crackdown on the so-called web

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:23.910
markets are they call wet markets I I

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.440
don't know that's where you go to get

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.820
wet that's ooh yeah let's but it would

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.230
be nice to thing about like a communist

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.700
regime just like going through and

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.380
stormtrooper gear and it's like slapping

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.850
bats out of hands they will probably

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.230
contain the [ __ ] out of they'll knock

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.410
that off yeah well yeah I like the idea

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.900
of the you know the black market for

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.570
[ __ ] bat wings and stuff like that

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:51.420
and listen like you gotta approach it

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.920
with obviously you know cultural

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.860
humidity we do humility we do all sorts

00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:01.020
of weird [ __ ] but yeah we have blue true

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:01.620
and they have

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.230
you know Tiger penis and various things

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.810
like this but yeah we got to be careful

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.220
about

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.380
about seeing too much from that

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.320
perspective but everyone it's it's it's

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.300
widely sort of accepted that that was

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:23.590
likely zoonotic Genesis is funny though

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.960
to think about like you know especially

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.490
like China there's like they can scan

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.380
your face and recognize you in like two

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.700
seconds and you know they have it's like

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.860
we have always like technocratic world

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.390
regimes and like we have a disease that

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.460
comes and starts wiping out geezers and

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.200
they're like they're reading bats that's

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.320
how this [ __ ] started it the glow a

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.780
man that's that's it's not it's not it's

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.850
not false to say that we have a global

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:48.730
financial collapse because someone

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:53.320
[ __ ] munch Tibet I mean I just wonder

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.480
you know is anyone like scope and this

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.890
might be too far out but is anyway like

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:58.390
you know in terms of time there's anyone

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.250
scoping like the future implications of

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:01.990
this like are we gonna start having

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.690
these superbugs more and more like how

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.520
is this thing is this is it that this

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.870
thing itself is so easily spread or is

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.310
it like is it the conditions we're in

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.020
that do this more like you know I'm

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.630
talking about yeah so yeah I mean I I

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.310
know lots about that type of stuff but

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:24.310
like for example the last SARS was so

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:26.260
this is a service type virus was bad you

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:31.950
know 17 years ago 2003 and osterholm

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:37.690
mentions densely crowded urban centers

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:42.430
as likely you know epicenter for for

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.790
future pandemics because you're you're

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.640
sneezing on each other man like you know

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.230
there was [ __ ] like what capsule

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.870
hotels and stuff like that like that's

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.740
that's what's gonna happen so you gotta

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.780
you gotta keep two meters you got to

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.330
wear your condom you got to wash your

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:04.270
hands mind your own business don't

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.500
sneeze on each other

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.560
no bad so yeah I wanna get one of them

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.730
to start making jackets that like

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.080
measure out two meters so you're like a

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.550
bit of a wingspan you can keep people

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.270
out I like that oh I hate I hate [ __ ]

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.160
clothes sorry so you you accuse

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.250
Canadians of being close talkers

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:26.530
well I resent that my bed this is only

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.390
off of it I went to an all exclusive one

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.490
time and I it was for some reason it was

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:33.250
only me my ex-wife and just Canadians

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.650
there is the most bizarre thing and like

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:36.940
I remember we were all hanging out we

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.679
would drink all day and like dude is

00:30:38.679 --> 00:30:40.900
like at least five times whoever I was

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.490
hanging out with we get so drunk they

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.710
were just like their little problems out

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.330
on me and I'm like what what is it now

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.320
you know I thought it was kind of funny

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.230
I got close talker I kind of my I have

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.360
an uncle who's lean actual genuine like

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.130
two inches from your face close talker

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.480
and I just kind of mixed up the two so

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.440
well this is Corona precautions get back

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.590
the [ __ ] up so what's your feeling it's

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.450
a-you know you're you've done some

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:12.220
reading around mythology and even in

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:18.220
sort of judeo-christian myths the idea

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:24.130
of pestilence and and plagues is an

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.970
important theme so what do you like what

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.830
you know and following on social media

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.100
[ __ ] like how are you seeing people

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.530
react like how are your you know how are

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:39.100
your friends who are skeptical about

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.880
Sandy Hook sort of reacting are they are

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.200
they hunkering down what's the story

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.800
there the story so the story there is

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.760
remembered remember that guy who got

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.440
arrested actually who was like a Harvard

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.720
scientist it was like getting paid by

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.370
the Chinese government to run programs

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:58.270
yeah vaguely yeah yeah so that got kind

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.460
of people are thinking that Corona that

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.050
guy invented or helped invent

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:05.290
coronavirus so that's where a lot of

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.000
this stuff came from and then there's

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
also like you know my my thinking on the

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.160
stuff two more is like this I think what

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.960
happens is this is obviously a real

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.360
thing but it's like the news can hype up

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.950
things as much as they want and they can

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.230
also kind of like slow the flow of

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.850
information a little bit to let people

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:23.620
get a little more hyped let markets

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.390
crash you know to kind of just cause

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.730
some chaos before the election so like

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.320
if you have this virus that is a real

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.540
virus no one invented it but you can

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.320
kind of manipulate information

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.090
a little more fear more chaos around it

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.190
I think that potentially be going on I

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.610
don't know

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:38.840
but if you're telling me like no it's

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.910
legit you know this thing's spreading

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.430
fast as [ __ ] oh but I mean there's no

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:47.120
doubt that panicking sells clicks you

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.140
know I mean like that's that's for sure

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.210
in terms of like a coordinated sort of

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.480
like effort or conspiracy I mean I think

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.740
that well I know I think there's decent

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:04.370
data to suggest that people who feel

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:07.760
imminently threatened or you know or

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.040
their love or they feel their loved ones

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.360
they're threatened tend to lean toward

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.630
the the right so in some ways you know

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.390
there's a couple you know ways to look

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.360
at it obviously they the economic

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.790
collapse is not good for for Trump's

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:28.310
reelection but in in other ways I mean

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.370
as relates to like controlling migration

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.280
and [ __ ] like that

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.980
yeah that falls into this or the the

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.540
rights hands like what do you think

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.590
there's some like like political

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.790
conspiracy like who was behind it who's

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.170
that's a good question because I haven't

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.360
heard I mean you could I mean this would

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.360
be pretty wild but it would be like try

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.220
to engineer well this is the other

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.410
conspiracy that I you know I think could

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.720
be possible of people trying to get a

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.760
global market on vaccines so then you

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.820
have this bug that spreads rampantly or

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.440
at least you portray it to be skirting

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.720
like you know worse than it is and then

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.120
now it's a vaccine maker you get to sell

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.700
one vaccine around the world for this

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.800
virus that you know could never come

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.179
back again for sure you know that's a

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:18.830
trillion dollar you know it's a trillion

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.770
dollar business move but yeah I don't

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:22.760
know man I get like you're saying

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.110
there's more and more people were in

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.300
denser cities and you know it's like I

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.210
don't know like healthy so I guess these

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:30.710
things would that was that was the thing

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.030
the brogan cast I threw me for a loop

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.399
saying we have so many obese people that

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:36.470
mm-hmm it's like an inbuilt that's like

00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:39.230
being a smoker yeah

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.919
well it is weird for whatever well

00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:43.929
problem should know I probably should

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:45.700
know it but I don't but for whatever

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:51.579
reason the comorbidities that worsen

00:34:51.579 --> 00:34:53.950
prognosis include like run the mills

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:56.880
stuff like hypertension type 2 diabetes

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:01.680
not immunosuppression

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.690
suppress conditions so that's that's

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.099
sort of funky

00:35:06.099 --> 00:35:07.780
you know like breath of breast cancer or

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.430
something like that it's sort of funky

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:14.140
but those are the data I don't know that

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.750
we're you know way more susceptible

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:20.440
because we're fat it's kind of I'd buy

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.549
that yes

00:35:21.549 --> 00:35:24.849
that's not body-positive weight so I

00:35:24.849 --> 00:35:26.890
would say that again the things that are

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.270
associated with dying from this disease

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.540
are more like type 2 diabetes

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.609
hypertension run-of-the-mill stuff so

00:35:33.609 --> 00:35:37.200
it's sort of interesting an age that's

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.230
associated that you're right that's in

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:47.710
hand with with extra pounds yeah that

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.119
was funny he was just like yeah we're

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:51.970
fat as [ __ ] so I just actually just

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.730
those like little like mobility scooters

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.470
just like whizzing around the streets

00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:01.210
nobody on them that pilots just

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:05.049
somewhere like miles behind a virus that

00:36:05.049 --> 00:36:07.180
just selectively wipes out fat people

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.670
would be chaotic well it's interesting

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.880
you know they so the in terms of vaccine

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.569
development as well so you know a couple

00:36:16.569 --> 00:36:20.109
things like with seasonal influenza we

00:36:20.109 --> 00:36:22.030
have decent data and it varies year to

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:25.170
year but the effectiveness on preventing

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.579
flu transmission is on the order of like

00:36:27.579 --> 00:36:30.490
a 50% reduction which is huge right so

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:32.740
we can in the states like you know we're

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.720
talking about potentially saving you

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.720
know like 40,000 people like its massive

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.160
that's how that's how many people are

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.470
killed by cars you know I mean those are

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:44.200
those are big numbers now I don't know

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.230
like I you know I looked into the gay

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.660
frog thing you know I mean like it's I

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.450
think you got to keep an eye on anytime

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:53.470
there's big money you got to be

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:54.700
skeptical

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:59.710
but there there's decent decent data as

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:04.710
relates to that so in terms of the the

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:09.339
kovat 19 vaccine one of the potential

00:37:09.339 --> 00:37:11.800
targets is the and I helped him not get

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:17.170
too nerdy here but as the ACE 2 receptor

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:19.180
so you might have you heard of ACE

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.310
inhibitors for treating hypertension I

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.880
have heard of that before yeah so it's

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.859
actually the same or a related receptor

00:37:28.859 --> 00:37:32.220
yeah and in terms of like like

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.510
susceptibility there's emerging data and

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.609
I'm not pretending that I am totally

00:37:36.609 --> 00:37:38.380
up-to-date with this but that you know

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.480
certain individuals have higher

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.390
expression of those receptors and are

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:46.119
going to be more sort of susceptible and

00:37:46.119 --> 00:37:48.880
this tends to include East Asian people

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.030
are going to be more susceptible to the

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:55.270
sort of lung effects and hits funny man

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:58.510
like I follow some some Facebook groups

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:00.369
with with medical people and they're

00:38:00.369 --> 00:38:04.359
like yeah I'm gonna get on [ __ ] cover

00:38:04.359 --> 00:38:06.460
so which is like a a nanny hypertensive

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.349
ACE inhibitor with the thought that or

00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:09.819
an ARB with the thought that it's gonna

00:38:09.819 --> 00:38:11.980
protect them against kovat who the [ __ ]

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:15.490
knows maybe East Asian people or would

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:16.690
that mean they're more likely to

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:18.339
hypertension wouldn't Westerners be more

00:38:18.339 --> 00:38:20.859
likely to experience hypertension so

00:38:20.859 --> 00:38:23.770
it's it relates to the susceptibility to

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:30.190
infection by by the virus yeah and then

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:35.290
potentially like responsiveness to any

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.119
hypertensive so it is true for example

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:41.319
that people of I believe it's just

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:43.750
African American as opposed to African

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:48.220
descent are respond less well to ACE

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:51.040
inhibitors for hypertension so they're

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.079
not first-line so they're you know it's

00:38:53.079 --> 00:38:54.730
caught it's the field of

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.339
pharmacogenomics says that we you know

00:38:57.339 --> 00:38:58.990
we aren't all the same although we'd

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.690
like to pretend to think that sometimes

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.210
and different people

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:06.980
are gonna respond if and differently or

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.680
be more susceptible that's based on how

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.980
they expressed this receptor that allows

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.640
the virus to to enter the cells oh

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.830
that's crazy yeah it's kind of crazy

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.780
if you don't respond well to ACE

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.360
inhibitors you could potentially get

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.180
this virus if anything anything it'd be

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.130
a bit lower but I mean getting getting

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.190
into the weeds a little bit but yeah

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:33.460
it's interesting like you know I think

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:38.830
yeah oh isn't it [ __ ] weeds you know

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:40.850
but that's where the learning happens

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:46.040
you know just so I have this sometimes

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.660
I'll just go on I still have no idea

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.490
what someone's talking about the

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.050
inhibitors is something that treats

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:53.810
hypertension young people can you know

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:55.430
some people they agree with their system

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:56.750
and some people can't take the ACE

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:58.550
inhibitors if you can't really tolerate

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.190
ACE inhibitors then that's associated

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.460
with the contraction of the virus or the

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.380
seconds associated with not like not

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.200
getting but I mean like when and you

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.080
know I don't know more detailed and to

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.010
say that if you have a lot of the ACE as

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:23.810
a receptor that is how the virus enter

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:27.410
cells so you're gonna tend to be well

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:29.480
responding to those types of medication

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.390
because you have a lot of it to block so

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:33.920
that's that's sort of it but it's just

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.610
funny that that these people are

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:41.000
exploring options that are like totally

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.250
not evidence-based like you know medical

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:45.260
people we've got to sort of take your

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.680
[ __ ] you hypertensive who reduce my

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.530
risk of getting infected there are a few

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:55.640
other sort of emerging therapeutic

00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:00.200
options what is it called rim DES aveer

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.890
is a like an A&E retroviral so this is

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:07.130
an RNA virus and you know we had

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:10.550
experience with SARS previously and then

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:12.230
other things like even people are saying

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:13.010
like Tamiflu

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:14.870
have you heard you've heard of Tamiflu

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:17.180
right mhm yeah like some people are like

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.490
saying even Tamiflu

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.650
be potentially protective what about

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.410
good old garlic garlic yeah well you

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.609
know if you hang three cloves of garlic

00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:29.740
above you're above the door above you

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.270
know the entrance of your home

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:33.690
they say garlic has an antivirus

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:39.880
antivirus yeah I mean I yeah probably I

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.869
don't know

00:41:40.869 --> 00:41:45.130
well Tamiflu sucks balls like again like

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.710
this is you know we were talking

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:52.030
previously about effectiveness of from

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.670
therapy for depression so so Tamiflu for

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:58.810
example in terms of duration of symptoms

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:02.109
for influenza A maybe saves you a day

00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:06.339
which I mean it's not not bad nothing to

00:42:06.339 --> 00:42:10.000
to sort of shrug at but it's certainly

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.710
not a cure

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:15.849
Tamiflu does potentially decrease viral

00:42:15.849 --> 00:42:19.570
shedding so the likelihood that that

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:22.570
you'll pass it on to someone else so

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:24.849
there's there's value in that now

00:42:24.849 --> 00:42:27.460
remember that's in the setting of of

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.880
influenza and the data I'm not familiar

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.470
with space out yet I hear I hear yeah

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.060
yeah I mean from you know from the other

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.410
stuff you're talking about from like

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:39.580
your you know you're asking like the end

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.500
of days scenarios and terms like from

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.780
like not even like a mythic perspective

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.490
but for like just people and think the

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:47.109
psychology of it it is interesting to

00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:48.750
think like because we are I think

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.150
especially in developed countries in

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:54.099
incredible bubble in terms of like our

00:42:54.099 --> 00:42:57.190
threats to safety or mostly non-existent

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.480
you know compared to like everywhere

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.660
else from any other a lot of time ever

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.330
for humans know I'll be curious to see

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:06.369
what a little a little brush up against

00:43:06.369 --> 00:43:08.770
potential widespread death does for the

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:11.320
you know for the mine collide yeah the

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.109
collective psyche you man I think it's

00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:15.970
good then it's good - it's good to

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:17.589
[ __ ] remember that you're immortal

00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:20.080
yes and like it I wouldn't be saying

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.060
this but I think for the collective this

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.220
a little inoculation against existential

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:28.000
boredom a little yeah pretty good yeah

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.400
no I heard that I mean

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.390
I think that you know I like with your

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:36.609
with your daughter and congratulations

00:43:36.609 --> 00:43:41.709
daddy that's fantastic you know do you I

00:43:41.709 --> 00:43:44.109
sure leave sort of like reflected on

00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:46.660
sort of like life and death and and you

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.859
know the circle oh do you like how thing

00:43:50.859 --> 00:43:52.599
you know it's probably changed your

00:43:52.599 --> 00:43:54.670
perspective a little bit I wash my head

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:56.709
yeah I wash my hands now he's never wash

00:43:56.709 --> 00:44:00.700
my hands I think I wash my hands I guess

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.709
psycho now on that I used to never worry

00:44:02.709 --> 00:44:04.479
about germs I was very much just kind of

00:44:04.479 --> 00:44:06.430
like I'm just particles from the ground

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:07.959
I'm eventually gonna drop back into the

00:44:07.959 --> 00:44:09.640
ground and dispersed back in now my

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.440
garden I got to keep particle body alive

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.930
for a while wash the hands you know I

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:15.789
play with the dogs and be aware of that

00:44:15.789 --> 00:44:17.920
you know so it's like yeah you got to

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.809
take care of particle body I for sure

00:44:19.809 --> 00:44:20.680
want to go buddy

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.259
and it's present fun yeah you know it

00:44:23.259 --> 00:44:25.719
does me I mean having a kid really for

00:44:25.719 --> 00:44:27.999
me it's just like I'm Tony I was saying

00:44:27.999 --> 00:44:30.279
our podcast last week it's sort of like

00:44:30.279 --> 00:44:32.380
a weird psychedelic experience that just

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.690
never stops it's like you're you're like

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:36.249
oh my god you real there's a weird

00:44:36.249 --> 00:44:37.690
transition thing like everything's

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.130
different now and then it just boom

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:41.440
that's it and it stays and it's just

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.049
like it's weird man I'm still digesting

00:44:44.049 --> 00:44:47.079
it is it's a but yeah it actually I was

00:44:47.079 --> 00:44:48.849
actually in a grade school during this

00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:51.549
thing being like scared to touch it when

00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:53.499
in reality I was never ever ever like

00:44:53.499 --> 00:44:55.719
that and I was like a kid would COFF and

00:44:55.719 --> 00:44:58.359
I'd move away like [ __ ] man so yeah it

00:44:58.359 --> 00:45:00.910
definitely it made me more aware you

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:02.709
know it kind of it feels like it plugged

00:45:02.709 --> 00:45:05.709
me into just society as a whole right

00:45:05.709 --> 00:45:07.779
away I was always kind of you know leuf

00:45:07.779 --> 00:45:09.519
about everything and now I am kind of

00:45:09.519 --> 00:45:10.869
plugged into everything and it was just

00:45:10.869 --> 00:45:12.190
like no choice of mine it just boom

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:14.859
happen automatically yeah all right and

00:45:14.859 --> 00:45:16.509
there's got to be something biological

00:45:16.509 --> 00:45:18.819
from that perspective there's there's

00:45:18.819 --> 00:45:23.140
data that your tea drops after you after

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:27.519
you sire offspring so I read that too I

00:45:27.519 --> 00:45:30.190
read that willfully man yeah my teas and

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:34.449
my [ __ ] boots it's busy I'm gonna

00:45:34.449 --> 00:45:36.009
start working out I do want to get real

00:45:36.009 --> 00:45:37.779
Jack for my daughter just some other

00:45:37.779 --> 00:45:39.519
time she can like finally see me and

00:45:39.519 --> 00:45:41.140
recognize me but Danny's [ __ ] ripped

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.150
but the

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:45.519
yeah I said I know there's a kind of I

00:45:45.519 --> 00:45:47.079
was reading a lot about skin skin and

00:45:47.079 --> 00:45:48.819
like the oxytocin boost of like putting

00:45:48.819 --> 00:45:52.029
it yes that is real it is kind of I mean

00:45:52.029 --> 00:45:53.829
I don't know I can't verify that it's my

00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:56.499
oxytocin but like you you get like high

00:45:56.499 --> 00:45:57.849
from it you rub it like it you put like

00:45:57.849 --> 00:45:59.740
your infant to your bare chest and it's

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.390
like you know her bare chest of yours

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.880
and you're just kind of like it's

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.470
unbeliev the feeling of it's just like

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:07.869
the most ridiculous peaceful feeling

00:46:07.869 --> 00:46:09.369
it's really funny man

00:46:09.369 --> 00:46:12.759
it's primal yeah I mean well Peterson

00:46:12.759 --> 00:46:15.930
what the [ __ ] was it so Peterson quoted

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:18.970
so there was this rat guy pengs kept and

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.519
I might be brutalizing his name there

00:46:21.519 --> 00:46:26.230
but he did lots of developmental studies

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:30.720
on rats and found that there was

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.710
importance in social and physical

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:37.599
development with rats getting tickled

00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:40.359
well like how yeah how [ __ ] up is that

00:46:40.359 --> 00:46:41.950
so like you know in a nurturing

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:44.440
environment like in addition you know to

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.509
remembering to you know supplement with

00:46:46.509 --> 00:46:54.819
vitamin D drops which you know part of a

00:46:54.819 --> 00:46:58.809
healthy diet is is getting tickled so

00:46:58.809 --> 00:47:02.739
it's you ever read the studies about

00:47:02.739 --> 00:47:05.680
like the baby monkeys who give it given

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.299
the option of like a bottle or like a

00:47:07.299 --> 00:47:09.009
soft piece of cloth that like I guess

00:47:09.009 --> 00:47:11.440
would resemble like cuddling their mom

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.619
they've choose to cloth die oh and die

00:47:14.619 --> 00:47:16.509
holy [ __ ] yeah they would choose a cloth

00:47:16.509 --> 00:47:19.960
over food again I you know fact I come

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.220
in my brain spinning that is something

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.259
cool but I I swear to God I heard them

00:47:23.259 --> 00:47:24.700
saying they would choose the cloth over

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.369
food that's how strong attachment so

00:47:27.369 --> 00:47:29.910
that's how strong you know biological

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.019
biologically driven are attachments are

00:47:32.019 --> 00:47:33.249
when we're like you know feeling

00:47:33.249 --> 00:47:35.049
attached to our family like the biology

00:47:35.049 --> 00:47:40.420
that's the same yeah like you can you

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.180
can pick up a [ __ ] car type of thing

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:45.910
super motive super motivated how's mom

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:48.190
doing she's chilling man girls have it

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.650
hard with that because they're like

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:52.509
apparently so we had a c-section because

00:47:52.509 --> 00:47:53.799
the bilkul cord is wrapped around her

00:47:53.799 --> 00:47:56.890
neck so yeah I've heard when the when

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.599
woman gives birth in the vagina like

00:47:58.599 --> 00:48:01.239
fully expands that gives women like a

00:48:01.239 --> 00:48:04.299
deluge of like a hormonal cocktail to

00:48:04.299 --> 00:48:05.619
help them through the postpartum period

00:48:05.619 --> 00:48:08.440
and women have c-sections apparently

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.680
they don't get that what my wife gets

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.349
that once a week of what she say what if

00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:18.630
I uh we talking about vaginal expansion

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:28.539
Dell users are with with but you know

00:48:28.539 --> 00:48:31.210
yeah so so that makes certain is that

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:33.579
like an attachment stimulating sort of

00:48:33.579 --> 00:48:35.170
experience or what's the idea there

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:36.880
that's the idea yeah that it kind of

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.319
like just simulates the like a surge of

00:48:41.319 --> 00:48:43.299
positive hormones to kind of help with

00:48:43.299 --> 00:48:45.299
that postpartum because there is like a

00:48:45.299 --> 00:48:47.170
you know whether they say it or not

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:48.759
there is like a grief and loss thing of

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:50.440
like you were pregnant now you're not as

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.849
much as they don't want to be pregnant

00:48:51.849 --> 00:48:53.559
I'm sure there's like a it's gotta be

00:48:53.559 --> 00:48:55.269
weird to like not have that thing inside

00:48:55.269 --> 00:48:58.329
you anymore and I don't I don't know man

00:48:58.329 --> 00:49:00.609
I think it's just the experience itself

00:49:00.609 --> 00:49:03.339
is so just harrowing and then it's like

00:49:03.339 --> 00:49:05.319
yeah then it's like is my attention is

00:49:05.319 --> 00:49:07.089
my attachment strong enough which

00:49:07.089 --> 00:49:08.739
although you know the very anxious

00:49:08.739 --> 00:49:10.690
there's a self-critical thing and then

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.369
you're critical and anxious about your

00:49:12.369 --> 00:49:14.140
attachment itself and it dude it's like

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.480
it just needs like you know women should

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.519
have off for like six months after they

00:49:18.519 --> 00:49:27.700
have a baby but you guys who could use

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:28.779
it and they'll fight they'll be like

00:49:28.779 --> 00:49:30.730
[ __ ] you know you don't need that

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.369
it's like what are you doing like it's

00:49:33.369 --> 00:49:35.680
the most important like the the brain

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.660
changes made within those first like you

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.220
know really like what is like first like

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.499
six years but still it's like dude it's

00:49:41.499 --> 00:49:43.450
so important to be there and it's like

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:45.999
again this is where like you know global

00:49:45.999 --> 00:49:48.279
you know maybe pandemic or virus and

00:49:48.279 --> 00:49:49.230
everyone's like how the [ __ ]

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:51.849
economies [ __ ] up and it's like but

00:49:51.849 --> 00:49:53.109
then again if we don't have the economy

00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:55.089
right you know it's kind of all one

00:49:55.089 --> 00:49:58.180
thing I guess yeah but they're like at

00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.890
that time off I mean it you know

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:02.769
postpartum depression is a huge issue

00:50:02.769 --> 00:50:05.859
and so you need to you know providers

00:50:05.859 --> 00:50:08.940
like routinely screen

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:13.110
and postpartum psychosis is another

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.970
thing that's not that rare I'm gonna go

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:16.380
with something like on the order of one

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.250
in a thousand

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:20.130
but like Frank psychosis and it's just

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:22.620
this [ __ ] like the the dyad is like so

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.530
powerful and the common theme is it like

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:29.160
with infanticide is the mum trying to

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.580
protect baby from the like the cruelty

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:35.190
of the world right as opposed to like

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:37.410
being you know like I hate this [ __ ]

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.300
thing I can't go out and drink wine with

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.560
my girlfriend's anymore

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:47.490
yes it's like yeah it's [ __ ] yeah they

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:49.010
had the babies of it that's like a

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:51.480
that's a tall order for me like for me

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.070
I'm you know it's like it was a big

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:54.690
change I'm like I'm just like super

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:57.000
stoked went this is awesome and I think

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.160
for women there is this like if you're

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.780
already even if you're not already prone

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:02.520
to anxiety and depression I think they

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.210
all experienced some kind of dip in mood

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.950
absolutely the worst time and then you

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:09.510
know there's you're saying issue of like

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:11.070
that's kind of a critical time for

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:12.750
attachment and bonding and then like

00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:14.700
you're the baby's just something like

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:17.490
Osmo singh you you know like verbal

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:20.190
language emotional cues so like then it

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:22.440
can if you're like all sad the baby can

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.780
like instinctually try to like adapt

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:27.180
their behaviors to suit mom their dads

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:30.060
mood you know shape their personality

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:31.940
for the rest of their life so yeah yeah

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:34.380
yeah I mean there's you know and there's

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:37.050
like there's like a school that that

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:39.000
attributes like all sort of

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
psychological illness to [ __ ]

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.860
delivery trauma and stuff like that yeah

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.720
and and I mean it's so important

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:48.840
obviously for those really sensitive

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.090
sensitive developmental first weeks

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:54.210
months baby blues though like women

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:56.730
feeling bit down is to be 8 normalized

00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:00.270
like you know like 50% of women are

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:02.310
gonna feel a bit shitty I mean they just

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:05.820
had a [ __ ] 8 pound bowling ball

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.530
explode out of their abdomen

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:10.160
yeah or you know I be in a pissy mood

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.470
yeah dude like if yeah either it like

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:16.140
came out just like absolutely wrecked

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.120
the vagina or it was like cut out of

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.100
their stomach and pulled out of them

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.170
while they're like do that that watching

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:25.050
that was horrifying of just like being

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:27.030
just seeing my wife like shivering on a

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:29.670
cold table just like him wild like and

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:31.800
seeing her wince and hearing them God

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.620
you do I was like mm-hmm that was tough

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.140
to watch it's yeah it's it's pretty

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:39.840
intense eh yeah yeah they you know it's

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.930
uh it's such a high-stakes time and

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:45.630
nuchal cord that is the couple raps like

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:47.670
you know I wouldn't get too fussy I'm

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:50.160
sure your your dogs told you that that's

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.020
not uncommon but it's great that she was

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:55.890
delivered by by the section yeah man

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:59.100
like gain not without identifies I've

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.820
seen babies come out [ __ ] dead you

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.190
know form sections and yeah and like oh

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:08.340
my god yeah you know almost it's sort of

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.010
too intense too to speak to too much

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:15.030
right now but it's a it's a it's a big

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:19.280
deal and I'm glad that that your wife

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:23.850
followed her instinct and and had that

00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:26.190
assessment that's fantastic so you know

00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.500
just to kind of revisit the theme there

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.710
a little bit like elective c-sections

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:33.510
now this was an elective c-section but

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.120
it was you know they gave her a choice

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.130
or like we strongly strongly recommend

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:39.870
and she just goes like it you know

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:42.030
unless we wait till emergency time but

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:43.320
you can do it now and it'll definitely

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.510
be good and she was like let's do it

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:48.150
right so she pulled the trigger yeah so

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:50.550
we're you know where is the with with

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:54.240
with the [ __ ] hitting the fan those you

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.530
know especially the vents or the

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:57.660
anesthesiologist like she wasn't put

00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:00.450
under she likely had a spinal but they a

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.010
lot of the staff that are going to be

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:04.230
involved with these you know

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.570
quote-unquote elective procedures but

00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:09.840
probably our you know best option are

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:14.610
going to be busy with dealing with

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:17.910
[ __ ] eight-year-olds with the with

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:21.000
with flooded lungs you know I mean so

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.800
that's that's sort of the real world

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.530
like consequences when the resources are

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:31.050
diverted from from where they should be

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:32.520
yeah I mean if you think about the

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.140
hospitai mean I don't know how it is in

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:36.130
Canada here the hospital on any given

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:38.860
they anytime it's about emergency room

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.300
unless you're like or having a heart

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.220
attack it's about a three to a two to

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:44.860
three hour wait yeah that's normal you

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:46.180
know so then when you like you've said

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.130
you just kind of swamp that system with

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:50.830
a bunch of dying geezers it's like yeah

00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:52.720
you get to you get you know told to go

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.000
home three hours later later and you're

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.040
you're bringing [ __ ] coronavirus home

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:01.030
thanks doc take a Tylenol

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:03.100
you got coronavirus now we're gonna have

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.810
to start doing like whatever I see like

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:06.640
old Asian people doing like Tai Chi and

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.020
[ __ ] like in the morning in the park

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:10.210

there with the disclaimer that you know

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:35.080
for to my best knowledge this was this

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.640
was fairly accurate and this is not a

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.010
[ __ ] public health announcement I'm

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:41.980

00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.890
a bunch of people that like to laugh

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:47.170
that are probably pissed off with all of

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:48.160
the

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.610
the discrepant information that they've

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:53.740
been getting so it would be important if

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.330
you had any questions to talk to your

00:56:55.330 --> 00:57:00.130
doctor or to consult your local Public

00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:04.270
Health Unit to verify information and

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:07.210
what you should do in this scenario ok
