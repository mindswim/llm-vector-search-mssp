00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.729
flying start

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.380
why thinking acres 42,000 square feet I

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.270

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.890
in the last episode there were like his

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.590

that he was writing for back in Ireland

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.509
okay and these are some of the other

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.329
guys that are young that represent young

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.130
Ireland with him there's a guy named

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.350
John Mitchell these are the important

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.270
guys and Smith O'Brien there was also

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.060
this guy named golf Balfe who balfe yeah

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.590
piece of [ __ ] dude he was a [ __ ]

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.159
rebel spies a spy for the British dude

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.820
he like joined up with them and was like

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.710
what's up like I'm part of this and he

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.420
went to school with one of them he went

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.220
to school with Thomas martyr when they

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.670
were younger

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.920
mm-hmm so he was he is by the entire

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.230
time he start to finish when they

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.550
when they were trying to plan his

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.989
uprising I mentioned this a little I

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.269
just say yeah yeah but he was the one

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.970
and then when they caught Smith O'Brien

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.110
they used ball valve to [ __ ] point

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.090
him out to finger him in the jail cell

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.250
but it was dark on the other side of the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.549
cell and both was in a cloak he was like

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.190
yes that's him and they had no idea it

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.150
was him but well we get to this later

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.560
but I mean this is a lot of this is

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.569
gonna be not very chronological both

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.549
[ __ ] followed them down to Van

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.450
Diemen's land and kept like tabs on yeah

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.879
but he wasn't spying on them really but

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.769
he was like it was this weird like I

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.230
don't know why he did it he just bought

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.329
a bunch of land in Van Diemen's land and

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.000
went down and lived around them but

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.690
didn't he like bought cattle in Tasmania

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.989
he had been payed a lot by England for

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.760
what he had done by being a spy with

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.890
them it's almost like he defined his

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.299
life by like it was like a weird

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.950
obsession with these dudes that he went

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.239
down and lived with them when they were

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.310
down there but they didn't they they

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.260
didn't know he was there they thought he

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.269
escaped during the rebellion was it

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.669
guilt you think was he like I don't know

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.349
eventually one of them ran into him in a

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.310
bar it was like in Tasmania they found

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.419
him and right when they saw him they

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.880
were like you were the [ __ ] spy you

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.010
piece of [ __ ] why were they like what

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.880
are you doing down here

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.799
what's that once they even saw him down

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.889
there because they knew he had been they

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.120
knew he hadn't been arrested otherwise

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.579
he wouldn't be at that bar hmm on that

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.560
land yeah they just instantly saw him

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.840
yeah you're the [ __ ] one it was back

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.430
then there's no way else he had been

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.590
sent there yeah other than with England

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.230
and then you know he feared for his life

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.660
because most of Van Diemen's land now

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.900
Tasmania was Irish prisoners and so like

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.150
all the people that lived on the island

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.190
either got there by being a convict like

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.260
a father and their family was or

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.669
something like so they all kind of

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.340
[ __ ] hated England so this guy word

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.500
got around who he was and he got he

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.419
didn't get murdered he got promoted by

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.390
England to be like the head jailer and

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.010
Port Arthur which was like their worst

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.310
prison there

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.790
yeah no justice but maybe he'll get his

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.710
who knows

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.500
Port Arthur Jean Port Arthur Jean it has

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.250
me yeah

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.440
and that was like where you went for

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.530
like hard labor and it was like a rough

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.850
really rough [ __ ] prison like blood

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.139
all that like the way they describe is

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.030
like blood on the walls they had the cat

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.610
of nine tails web they would use yeah

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.020
just hit me like it was [ __ ] crazy

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.330
but so so that's where we left off is

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.330
Thomas Mars down in Tasmania yeah 1850

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.010
it was about I mean we're good this

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.900
isn't again gonna be that college but

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.690
1850s about where we're at which was the

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.240
year Zachary Taylor died he was a

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.200
president okay Zachary Taylor died his

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.050
first year in office because he ate

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.140
fruit and iced milk at a 4th of July

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.360
party at the Washington Monument and he

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.660
got hit too many sweet treats what to me

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.950
that's how he died he had too many sweet

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.650
treats he got diarrhea that was it and

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.419
he died five days later [ __ ] holy [ __ ]

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.250
what's the deal with that like you just

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.260
they couldn't just like the dysentery

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.300
and stuff I don't know I'm a bunch of

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.800
other people at that party had also

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.260
gotten sick it's crazy you hear people

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.840
like big big time people died it's like

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.690
yeah just got caught in a cold rain yeah

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.220
it was it yeah I forget what President

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.660
was it might be Harrison uh died because

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.700
he got pneumonia giving his inauguration

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.590
speech yeah and he wanted to do it in

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.180
like a thin jacket or something like

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.490
that yeah that's hilarious

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.919
you know his was the shortest presidency

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.740
yeah he died giving his inauguration

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.370
like a month later so the president dies

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.289
Zachary Taylor's dead and in comes

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.860
Millard Fillmore hmm so he picked up his

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.690
term that finished and you know that

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.130
term ended in 1853

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.490
but the reason that's important is cuz

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.720
Millard Fillmore was looking for

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.419
re-election from the start so like right

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.700
away he was very Pro Irish like the

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.960
whole country like if you wanted to win

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.910
in office you were you would do stuff

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.940
like a measure was introduced in the US

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.409
Senate calling for the immediate release

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:38.140
of all the guys on in Tasmania

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.570
the US was very Pro like well at this

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.040
point all those people from the potato

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.600
famine in the forties right we're like

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.560
here yeah between 40 and 50 about

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.260
800,000 Irish people came right just in

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.490
that decade yeah yeah and they

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.690
immediately made

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.910
yeah and they made a lien each of them

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.200
yeah so like a quarter of the population

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.920
in Boston New York Philly and Baltimore

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.720
were all Irish born people in one

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.420
quarter of each city damn yeah like all

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.470
Irish so like a lot of these politicians

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.200
like Millard Fillmore was doing [ __ ]

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.610
like we need to free these got these

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.460
free these young Ireland like so the US

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.210
was very Pro like he issued a statement

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.340
the President did that if Thomas Moore

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.780
and his friends every were able to

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.940
escape Tasmania come to the United

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.770
States they'd be pardoned like they

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.210
would never send them back to England

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.720
gotcha

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.030
not like Russia they were snowed in yeah

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.110
[ __ ] like that yeah

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.840
so was it also good politics to just

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.960
like kind of be like [ __ ] England they

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:50.620
can get excited but also yeah hold on

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.180
sorry um so these so they were holding

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.580
like rallies and [ __ ] in New York for

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.710
like for Irish but like they were trying

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.650
to raise money and guns to send Ireland

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.020
for this like you know always they did

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.090
that forever yeah but now all that was

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.670
diverted into sending money for an

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.860
escape for all these guys instead of

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.180
arming them it was like we need to get

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:17.840
everything

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.760
yeah like nomadic criminals yeah there's

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.110
a bunch of Marauders and [ __ ] just

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.200
everywhere damn yeah whoa so this guy

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.770
ran off and was like kind of lone Desert

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.290
no but there's Australian colonies and

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.030
then in unties mania they would you know

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:36.800
they'd have the same jungle I don't

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.230
think Tasmania is that jungle there's

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.910
some jungle down there but I think it

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.339
might be more desert I honestly like I'm

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:45.830
basing this off of like the Tasmanian

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.370
devil up to the island and it's just

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.050
it's all jungle and there's a good

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:56.660
volcano yeah yeah the drawing of his

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.110
house it looked like pretty dusty like

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.060
area of mountainous yeah probably lost

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.680
[ __ ] it was like a prison place they

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.970
probably tried to pick like a shitty

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.449
place to send them yeah so that guy

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:09.740
showed up at the wedding and was like

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.670
hey I'm gonna [ __ ] leave Tasmania I

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.410
think I'm getting the [ __ ] out of here

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.510
it was good to see you congratulations

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.240
on the wedding and we take my dog you

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.890
gave him his dog it was a greyhound

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.579
named Brian

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:32.080
so McManus actually escaped in 1851 by

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.880
sending a dying man this guy that was

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.110
dying this Irish dude that was dying

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.360
that kind of looked like him was gonna

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.250
go report to the hospital because he had

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.660
been on the lam the whole time yeah they

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.040
have no idea they didn't know where he

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.020
was

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.400
then he just sent his dude that was

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.050
definitely dying to the hospital to say

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.630
it was him and they went to arrest that

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.220
guy and that's when he skated they all

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.480
had to do like a trick

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.520
you have to like trick the English to

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.370
escape honorably yeah but he could have

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.230
just left but instead he had he had to

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.830
pull one last prank yeah how could they

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.530
excatly what was the means of escape

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.560
so what McManus did was he went and met

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.650
with this trading you pay you have

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.540
someone on the outside pay a captain of

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.460
like a trading vessel and then you go

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.880
out and meet them what's up and yeah he

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.940
actually got on this boat called the

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.540
Elizabeth Thompson

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.530
I think sailed it was like trading wool

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.690
from Australia to the UK but it would

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.520
have to stop because it would go through

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.940
the Pacific around South America and

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.920
then stop in Brazil and he would just

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.060
you would just get on a different ship

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.100
that was going to America went back to

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:45.250
England so he escapes and Marr finds out

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.080
about it and McManus when he gets to

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.230
California is met with like a huge like

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.020
a parade the [ __ ] senators they're

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.820
like all the judges and say it like they

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.590
all are like yeah like he's just met

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.640
with all this mmm

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.680
fanfare and Maher finds out about it and

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.800
is like if they liked him that much the

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.000
[ __ ] am I doing here

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.060
yeah smart was depressed the whole time

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.610
until he met his BAE yeah 18 year old

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.670
[ __ ] Catherine he'll turn the frown

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.560
upside down dude yeah nice little 18

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.080
year old he had a nice Shack picture

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.260
Catherine Bennett I bet yeah it also

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.780
goes to show you just how like the power

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.240
of like a young bay yeah being exiled

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.890
and [ __ ] Tasmania and you just start

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.440
[ __ ] an 18 year old really yeah

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.910
there's also something extra hot that

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.280
it's like you know yeah yeah diamond

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.350
yeah it's like a prison colony thing and

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:36.940
you're all trapped there they built like

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.100
an ice house as a dog he's got a patch

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.230
of land that he's farming on he's right

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.190
on a lake

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.330
it's where its houses who would go on

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.030
sale every day on the Esperanza that was

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.830
the name of his boat Wow named it after

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.000
his old bay Wow

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.340
I don't know I don't know I'm sure she

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:57.590
knew actually maybe so he slips into

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.230
this like he's content going four months

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:01.520
after the wedding he's still he's like

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.110
very [ __ ] like life's pretty good

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.850
this is sick everything's all right they

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.140
said he was in the best shape of his

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.880
life he's jacked he's out farming every

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.160
day he's getting he's getting tan he's

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.100
looking good yeah he's [ __ ] hot the

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.630
timing sounds about right about four

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:21.770
months and he was like exactly so free

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:25.130
to caliber that was back then that was

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.430
nice too back then it's not yeah nice so

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.080
he's [ __ ] killing it he's happy then

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.500
like his biological bay clock kicks in

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.170
he's like this is the bit yeah

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.910
especially that's what really helped him

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.980
was all his all his boys on the island

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.180
were pissed that he was marrying her

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.800
they're like you're marrying beneath you

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.020
dude you're [ __ ] got the blood of

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.580
kings in you and you're gonna marry some

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.390
[ __ ] idiots daughter yeah so they're

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.340
all upset about that which also led him

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.680
to be like [ __ ] you guys I love her true

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.840
he was fully he was abused under the

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.000
posad also it's also as I look around

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.770
you idiots we're gonna find dudes

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.500
daughter's dude that was a high offense

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.630
back then if you got lowly snitch people

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:06.890
were like dude what the [ __ ] wrong

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.390
with you yet no they were like act like

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:10.100
everybody was upset that he married her

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.580
yeah dude but yeah four months in of

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.590
like a good life he starts to be like

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.470
what am I doing here dude [ __ ] out here

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:22.070
so he starts to like plan an escape he

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.720
tells his BAE she's gonna have to chill

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.470
because at this point she is pregnant

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.210
which that probably helped the reason

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.230
why he wanted to escape he had a

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.260
pregnant bay and he was like listen you

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:36.050
stay here you guys wait here until I get

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.510
to America and then I'll send word we

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:39.890
might not see each other for like two

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.920
years yeah that's the plan she's

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.750
pregnant he's like I when I can see each

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.090
other for a while so what the [ __ ] can

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.730
she do anyway what do you mean back then

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:50.960
if you told your wife and you lived on

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.720
70 acres of land you're like yo I'm out

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.190
I'll be back it's like what you're gonna

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.320
[ __ ] write a letter to somebody yeah

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.910
and it's like you know you just had to

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.640
sit there and wait for you then there's

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.220
well yeah she wasn't a criminal so she

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.080
could leave okay yeah but she was

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.850
pregnant in the plan was for them for

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.799
her to go to Ireland to stay with his

00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:11.169
dad and like their nice place Scott you

00:22:11.169 --> 00:22:13.570
got because the dad's still rich that

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:17.019
makes more sense yeah also it didn't

00:22:17.019 --> 00:22:18.940
last the last episode I said it would

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.830
take like 11 months to go from Ireland

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.600
to Australia which was wrong

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.690
it takes like five or six months that's

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.850
still crazy long the reason I was

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.679
thinking that was because Mitchell that

00:22:29.679 --> 00:22:33.340
guy I told you about his ship when he

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.169
got shipped out stopped in South Africa

00:22:35.169 --> 00:22:38.139
for like four months on the way because

00:22:38.139 --> 00:22:39.460
they were gonna try to drop him off in

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.260
South Africa this is right when South

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.870
Africa was having like a kind of an

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.039
uprising and they were like no you're

00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:46.600
not you can't put prisoners here like

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.159
that was a big thing for them so they

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:51.220
his ship stayed in port for like four

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.809
months and they didn't let him off

00:22:52.809 --> 00:22:54.789
mm-hmm he stayed on the [ __ ] boat in

00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:55.960
the cell it sucks

00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.700
she sucks so Mars planning his escape

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.450
which is crazy because the letter like

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.789
he's sending a letter to the United

00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:09.429
States and then to his dad in Ireland

00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:12.070
from New York gets the letter and then

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.990
that's how he's communicating via letter

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.510
to set up an escape and each letter

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:19.179
takes like from the New York to Ireland

00:23:19.179 --> 00:23:21.399
to send that letter you could mail it at

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:23.139
Christmas they said and you wouldn't get

00:23:23.139 --> 00:23:24.850
it until April [ __ ]

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.070
like Jesus communicational it's just a

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.750
handwritten letter whose house it was

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.600
mail out it's just I think you're a lot

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.000
of nail things no one's like check in

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.019
yes I know on your word you promise you

00:23:38.019 --> 00:23:40.480
my word also the chance of letters being

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.330
lost or probably lost all the time just

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:52.659
a ship [ __ ] sinking like arrange this

00:23:52.659 --> 00:23:55.149
escape is [ __ ] insane

00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:59.740
January 3rd 1852 is when Marr makes his

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.070
escape also in 1852 interesting the

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.529
Australian Gold Rush there's a ton of

00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:08.320
gold in Australia really yeah yeah who's

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.539
getting that gold the Irish prisoners in

00:24:10.539 --> 00:24:12.399
England but yeah that's there's a huge

00:24:12.399 --> 00:24:14.950
rush of people to Austria

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.830
non prisoners so now regular people are

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.750
starting to move in and they're like we

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.370
can't have any more prisoners down here

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.380
so that starts the beginning of people

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.990
being like I know more you can't make

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.210
this a penal colony yeah yeah cuz now

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.500
regular people are moving down there and

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.970
now a lot of regular people are moving

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.710
down and getting rich and then being

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.960
like no I make rules now yeah makes no

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.370
more [ __ ] prisoners so yeah it's

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.009
pretty funny how he escapes to he right

00:24:43.009 --> 00:24:44.659
he writes a letter to the governor

00:24:44.659 --> 00:24:47.019
saying that I'm escaping today at noon

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:49.129
because you had to have your honor

00:24:49.129 --> 00:24:51.620
yeah you couldn't break your word yeah

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.360
you gotta give'm you have to have like a

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.240
trick yeah you like the way McManus sent

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.649

00:24:57.649 --> 00:25:01.450
like it's me just kidding I'm leaving

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.929
why why I don't know what is that then

00:25:05.929 --> 00:25:07.279
you'd have to go around like people

00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:08.929
thinking you're like a weasel yeah yeah

00:25:08.929 --> 00:25:10.279
yeah cuz they're you it's like rather

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:11.720
than you breaking your word you kind of

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.610
like a mastermind more than like just a

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:16.039
liar yeah so his daring escape was he

00:25:16.039 --> 00:25:17.360
wrote a letter and said I'm gonna escape

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.879
today as soon as like the first patrol

00:25:19.879 --> 00:25:21.649
got into his house to look for him he

00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:23.389

away you'll never get me yeah yeah I

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.110
respect that

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.779
yeah pretty funny yeah upon word of his

00:25:32.779 --> 00:25:35.149
escape the governor announced in the

00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:36.649
newspaper that he was gonna send him to

00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:39.440
Port Arthur that that work camp and make

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.110
him the bottom Sawyer under a very good

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.529
top one in the paper he was like I'm

gonna make sure he gets raped by a big

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:51.950
guy a Sawyer yeah yeah he must have had

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.990
a lot of like rapists on the payroll

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.789
down there there's a ton of rapists

00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:57.409
you think that was like well then that

00:25:57.409 --> 00:26:00.440
was a cool thing to do what just be like

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.870
a rapist I don't think it was cool I

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.250
don't think it was ever cool but it was

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.009
just like hey we got these guys this

00:26:07.009 --> 00:26:10.129
kind of juice yeah they also they were

00:26:10.129 --> 00:26:11.539
sending people down there for [ __ ]

00:26:11.539 --> 00:26:13.940
nothing true so you get I mean in the

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.490
same area of like paroled rapist there

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.889
was also like you got caught stealing a

00:26:18.889 --> 00:26:21.350
goose they were trying to get rid of

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.940
poor shitty people in London

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.250
yeah shipping them off any reason for

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.440
anything [ __ ] if you were a debtor

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:27.970
like if you

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:35.740
in debt alright so this is uh when he

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.600
rides off cuz he like gives them a

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.980
chance to catch him he like goes and

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.200
stay he rides north up to the top of the

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.110
island and he's staying like on the way

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:45.910
everybody there hates the British so

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:47.350
they're like it stay at our house like

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.570
everybody's with him he's he's never

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.100
gonna get caught

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.600
was there like an underground railroad

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.090
for dudes getting off the island yeah

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.950
except it was just every single house

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:01.990
yeah yeah what hide you help you but the

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.850
plan was he gets up to the north where

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.160
he finally meets these two brothers that

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.800
and they have a small shitty raft that

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.930
they built like something you would

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.510
escape Cuba from and they're gonna take

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.880
him to this shitty island that's two

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.770
miles off the coast where he's gonna

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:18.730
meet that ship

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.680
he actually meets the exact same ship

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.960
that McManus cotton that's pretty well

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.160
yeah well I guess there's only a couple

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.200
of players in the stowaway game yeah

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.520
yeah yeah so it's uh he goes to this

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.320
island that's on it's it's in the Strait

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.350
between Tasmania and Australia it's

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.910
where the Indian Ocean meets the Pacific

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:41.500
Ocean in the water because of the

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.270
current like is it's like a river like

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.420
it's it's very [ __ ] wild [ __ ] so

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.680
they're on this shitty bow he's got

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.650
these two [ __ ] brothers leading the

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.780
brothers are [ __ ] away there's sharks

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.170
everywhere there's so many shark runs of

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:57.700
sharks that the brothers are just

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.100
hitting with oars because there's mako

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.810
sharks like smaller's these guys are

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:03.850
just [ __ ] whacking them but they also

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.040
said you could see giant [ __ ] shadows

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.230
underneath you all great white sharks

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:09.820
would just as soon as a boat was on the

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.230
water sharks were falling waters my

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.410
crystal clear here then they said any

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:15.940
time there was like a calm because

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.130
normally it was like waves and [ __ ] is

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.170
this straight but like anytime there's a

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.600
calm you'd look down and see took two

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.290
hours to get out the side two miles

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.780
pretty well yeah I can't on the two

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.220
hours of just like oh we're definitely

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.350
gonna die I can't imagine how many

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.390
[ __ ] sharks that were in that area

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.460
before like they even started hunting

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.640
and killing them pretty much just as

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.740
many do they're probably better

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.150
you know oh that's what I'm saying I bet

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.740
there was all your owns and tons and

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:49.330
tons yeah so then they get out to this

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:54.340
[ __ ] Island and they they start to

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.410
realize like oh [ __ ] maybe we're [ __ ]

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.490
because this plan is just from letters

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.290
like was it Tuesday the one that's

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:03.309
supposed to cut like they didn't know

00:29:03.309 --> 00:29:05.920
yeah brothers also trying to get out

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.210
over they know the brothers were staying

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.440
yeah they're just like trans brothers

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.500
were just telling them so they had

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.720
enough food for like a day which they

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.970
instantly obviously run out of and the

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.070
next day the brothers like we got to get

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:21.910
out of here like just write down on a

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.390
piece of paper that we didn't kill you

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.600
so everyone knows we're not traitors so

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.130
Mar writes down like they the Bennett

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.890
brothers are good dudes stop there was

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:34.690
also a dog on the island like a stray

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:35.980
dog was just on there and the brothers

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.110
were horrified like that's a pirates

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:44.710
ghost he's gonna get the idea of

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.660
surviving the Sharks and then being

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:54.400
afraid of a dingo crazy um so now it's

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.770
like a day later they're the the

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.870
brothers leave Mars just on a [ __ ]

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.640
desert island

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.410
there's no food he has to like climb a

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.110
cliff everyday to steal eggs from these

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:08.020
birds and he just keeps eating there's

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.679
snakes everywhere and then he's on that

00:30:11.679 --> 00:30:14.559
[ __ ] island for ten days before the

00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:16.809
ship comes on the tenth day he's like

00:30:16.809 --> 00:30:18.640
starving to death just sitting there in

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.970
a ship of pirates lands and they love

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:22.300
him

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.580
they know who he is they start giving

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.080
him [ __ ] Romney it's partying with

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.100
these guys

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.440
then he finally sees the ship and they

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.850
give him a rut the Pirates give him a

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.140
ride to the ship because he can't swim

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:35.590

engines yeah well about the Pirates were

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.110

straight just picking off whoever comes

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:07.530
yeah yeah like a rubber raft so also the

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.600

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.460

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.470
skinned them and then addressed all dude

out of Port Arthur that prison and a

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.390
guard just [ __ ] shot it because he

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:29.730
thought it was a kangaroo guard in the

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.890

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.400
a big meeting

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.250
they formed a militia against what they

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:17.630
called the bloody hand of the Pope

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:21.560
called the wide awakes there woke [ __ ] I

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.750
started saying woke wide awakes they had

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.660
a huge rally in Kensington that's where

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:30.800
they held their rally in [ __ ]

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.570
Kensington and they all freaked out

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:33.770
during the rally and just went around

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:37.310
burnt all the Irish churches Jesus [ __ ]

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:39.620
they killed 40 people yeah there was

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.060
like a nun that tried to stop them they

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.180
just hit her with rocks she had a huge

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.310
book burning what was pissing them off

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:49.420
about the Pope they hate the Pope dude

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.900
the Catholics know they're saying that

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.490
this was the Pope's like army to try to

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:57.140
ruin to make the rest of the world

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.910
Catholic and listen oh man [ __ ] ms

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:04.370
[ __ ] repeats itself yeah I mean

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:09.680
entirely rapists so they yeah they

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.750
burned like a Irish library and fire

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.520
stated they just you know went while

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.990
yeah but that's how they got their name

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.000
that know-nothings because whenever

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.710
police would ask him what happened they

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.510
don't like I know nothing about that so

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.770
there's literally a political party

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:23.150
called the know-nothings so it was

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:27.640
bounded off of that just lying perjury

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:33.430
pleading the fifth we're getting there

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.650
it's at this point at the Irish sort of

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:38.390
taking over the police in Philly

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:39.920
were they like yeah and then no nothing

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.230
was started to try to put together laws

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:43.220
of like

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:44.869
you know Irish people can't be cops

00:39:44.869 --> 00:39:47.750
Irish people can't be firefighters yeah

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:49.130
Irish people definitely can't be in

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:50.960
office [ __ ] like that then I was like a

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.840
reverse psychology it's named a bunch of

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.849
like hard shitty jobs like and you guys

00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:58.630
can't be lame

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:03.310
[Laughter]

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.440
so they also they also started making

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.170
like laws to try to limit immigration

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.570
and they tried to build the wall yeah

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:15.080
yeah they would make like the the the

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.270
dimensions of a ship that was carrying

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.460
people over it had to be like really

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.109
small so it couldn't fit a lot of people

00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:22.460
which just resulted in them just

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.910
cramming people in yeah dying on the way

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.210
yeah

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.920
while Maher was in New York he was

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.750
giving he was giving speeches that's how

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:33.830
he was making money he was like

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:35.510
traveling around he's do he was he was a

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:36.260
rogue comic

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.369
yeah who's going around giving speed

00:40:37.369 --> 00:40:38.720
he's getting paid a [ __ ] ton to do

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.650
that

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.990
finally Katherine Bennett does show up

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:44.869
with Mars father she had been sent to

00:40:44.869 --> 00:40:47.180
live with the father over in Ireland and

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.339
everybody was like confused as to how

00:40:49.339 --> 00:40:50.599
they were together cuz she was like real

00:40:50.599 --> 00:40:53.780

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.380

birth to his son okay who lived but then

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.510

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:01.220

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.510
depression and he was still going all

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.630
over the country in giving speeches he

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.160
was like this is this isn't what I'm

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.940
built for but eventually he met this

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.190
lady named Elizabeth Townsend it was

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:30.650
like a rich wasp like the Townsend's

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:35.360

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.090
side was like if you marry him you're

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:45.830

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.260
whoa and he like he wrote like a pretty

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.120
sick letter to her that was like you're

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.710

be part of your life - pretty cool

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:58.820
pretty neat stuff that is pretty firm

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.300
and so what so she married him yeah he

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:07.520
marries her so now his boy Mitchell all

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.860
the all the other all of young Ireland

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.620
has escaped Tasmania

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.760
yeah they all just not really good for

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.610
the governor here is it they tricked me

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:18.850
god damn it

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:20.930
that's how yeah I definitely [ __ ] this

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:24.490
up I don't know where the next girl I'd

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.640
it's definitely on a place I might run

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.800
into it again but while they were in

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.490
Tasmania which by the way it changed

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:38.780
from Van Diemen's land to Tasmania

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.490
around this time because everybody

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:42.260
wanted to get rid of that old stigma of

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:47.480
this being a prison colony yeah they

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.240
also Tasmania was granted like

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.000
sovereignty from England they got more

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.070
rights on this prison colony than

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:58.610
Ireland had why yes like while young

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:01.370
Ireland was in Tasmania Tasmania was

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:02.870
granted like you can have your own

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.720
Parliament and vote and all that [ __ ]

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.430
she all got papered yeah I suppose the

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:09.140
my take money hit that place and there's

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:09.970
like all right

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:13.240
yeah and young Ireland helped to bright

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.609
like Tasmania's Constitution they did

00:44:15.609 --> 00:44:17.040
all that for two that was pretty sick

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:21.900
while they were there so it all escaped

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.010
Mitchell though the guy I was talking

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:25.660
back I think Mitchell was the one who

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.340
knows Smith Oh Brian Mitchell was the

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.050
one who was stuck on that boat in South

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:31.570
Africa mm-hmm when he got to America he

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:36.160
became a pro-slavery writer okay which

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.359
that was where there was a big divide

00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:39.490
like he went south he got he got to New

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:41.530
York hated it yeah because all those

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:46.090
like wasps like like Mars father-in-law

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:48.849
like they hated the Irish then he go

00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:51.960
south and it's like no they like us here

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.000
and then it was easy to spin because the

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.060
South was fighting against the

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.240
government like this is the same

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.510
struggle you guys just came from yeah

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:09.130
but it uh more then you know he was

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:10.480
going on the road a lot he didn't feel

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.190
good but when he met his new BAE he got

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:14.830
like a new [ __ ] life and he started

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:15.760
to feel good about himself and he

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.220
started a paper that was anti-slavery

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.830
okay so Mars anti-slavery is Boy

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:24.130
Mitchell pro-slavery started kind of a

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:27.580
rivalry between two former [ __ ] dogs

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:29.380
Mitchell was like excited to finally

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:33.270
have some people he could [ __ ] on yeah

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.260
it's pretty funny if they're talking

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:36.460
about like well the important thing is

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:37.930
we can have an open conversation about

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.990
this at least we can hear each other's

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:44.589
viewpoints out of this that nice

00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:46.109
O'Connor this would be good for you okay

00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:49.390
so this is the was weird to a lot of

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:50.619
people that all the Irish that were

00:45:50.619 --> 00:45:52.390
coming over here started become racist

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:54.849
mm-hmm like they had just come when

00:45:54.849 --> 00:45:56.859
Frederick Douglas was in Ireland he was

00:45:56.859 --> 00:45:59.410
in Ireland in the 40s he was like he

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:00.970
said he had never once been judged for

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:03.040
his skin colour over there but in the

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.950
1850s all the Irish immigrants would

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:08.080
show up and be racist as fuk yeah he's

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.609
like as soon as they came to America

00:46:09.609 --> 00:46:13.900
they got indoctrinated against Italians

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.460
and stuff what no against black people

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:22.720
okay like an inferiority thing that's

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.470
from this is

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:24.940
quote from frederick douglass you know

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:26.800
this and how do you think I read her

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.960
Douglas would talk go ahead best

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.390
Frederick done I'm gonna do I just read

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:34.200
it teach me how to dougie

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.760
perhaps no class of our fellow citizens

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.950
has it carried this prejudice against

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:41.020
color to a point more extreme and

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.820
dangerous than have our Catholic Irish

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.400
fellow citizens know people on the face

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.470
of the earth have been more relentlessly

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:49.420
persecuted and oppressed on account of

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.820
race and religion than have these same

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.980
Irish people the Irish who at home

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.780
readily sympathize with the oppressed

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.790
everywhere are instantly taught when

00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:59.530
they step upon our soil to hate and

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:02.770
despise the Negro oh you said they are

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:05.320
taught that he eats the bread that

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:11.170
belongs to him pretty interesting right

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:12.400
when they get there all the politicians

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.030
are like if Lincoln wins or if we you

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:17.650
know emancipate the slaves they're gonna

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:19.900
take your job that's four million slaves

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.940
coming up here to take your [ __ ] job

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.420
yeah but like I'm sure there was also on

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.590
the part of the Irish a little bit of

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:28.800
being like well we're not those guys

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:35.200
true but the Irish they were like living

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.030
in tenements and they were hated by the

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.589
white people hmm

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:40.089
so it was a weird like that was the

00:47:40.089 --> 00:47:41.560
mentality that like if they do free

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.640
those slaves they're gonna come up here

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:47.140
and take whatever shitty job we have so

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.640
far I just didn't give a [ __ ]

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.470
safer they were getting like crushed and

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:51.670
they just see someone different make

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:54.849
[ __ ] you there's no like chill

00:47:54.849 --> 00:47:58.119
whatsoever on that yeah but again when

00:47:58.119 --> 00:48:00.119
he was in Ireland he was like everybody

00:48:00.119 --> 00:48:03.099
loved black people hmm as soon as they

00:48:03.099 --> 00:48:05.410
got here they were like [ __ ] I don't

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:09.099
like him right well yeah yeah yeah it

00:48:09.099 --> 00:48:12.430
was interesting word but more also in

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:13.750
that paper that pro-slavery

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:16.109
or anti-slavery paper he had was like

00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:19.060
writing they also got like 50,000

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.550
listeners or readers which is pretty

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:24.250
funny yeah by population standard he was

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.440
he was the Joe Rogan experience really

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.240
he was a lot of people in New York just

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.580
reading one page that's a lot how many

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:31.900
people were living in New York at this

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:36.710
time yeah probably because 800

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:39.480
yeah there's probably around like 3

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.870
million yeah um no that's high I don't

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:45.210
know that might inaccurate it's probably

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:47.310
too movie I don't know I think it's

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:49.670
pretty big I think like you need early

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:53.310
1900s there was like 8 or 9 million it

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:54.420
was like there's more there was more

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:55.740
people in New York City than there are

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:56.310
now

00:48:56.310 --> 00:49:00.180
yeah really yeah because everyone was

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:02.550
living everyone was living in the city

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:04.110
like suburbs

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:05.310
you know what I mean so it's like during

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:07.050
the day in New York there's like twenty

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.220
eight million people in there but yeah

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:12.690
only like eight actually I think but

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:13.770
yeah Marv was telling them all to

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:15.210
[ __ ] leave New York

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:18.140
like stop living in these [ __ ] shitty

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:22.140
tenements like just go build a hut in

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.090
the [ __ ] woods it'll be better than

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:25.860
this like he was it he was encouraging

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.990
the Irish to [ __ ] leave New York yeah

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:30.840
in a way yeah Marv ended up becoming

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.480
friends with a guy named Michael

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:36.090
Corcoran who was the leader of the 69th

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:38.820
Regiment of New York militia which ends

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:42.930
up being the Irish Brigade Corcoran his

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:45.080
whole brigade was Irish

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.920
Corcoran got in trouble because he

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.960
refused to March his regimen in a parade

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.090
for the Prince of Wales which resulted

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:53.310
in him getting court-martialed and sent

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:55.860
to jail and it sparked a national debate

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:59.910
with Irish loyalties interesting

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.350
Harper's Weekly wrote a big thing about

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:03.900
it that was like 75% of the violent

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.490
crimes are perpetrated by these [ __ ]

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:07.830
Irish hooligans the kind of the same

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.390
argument people use against black people

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:11.820
now like they represent this percentage

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.100
of the population and all of the violent

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.860
crime like these people right wait

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.480
that's weird what were they marching for

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.940
the Prince of Wales why would the

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:23.610
Americans want to do that not to fight

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:25.710
no no yeah yeah yeah well yeah I'm

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:30.540
saying boys with English yeah I thought

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:32.390
there would still be like [ __ ] the king

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:38.280
no it's the 1850s no yeah yeah the Irish

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.770
hooligans started then that was a term

00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:42.390
for the Irish people they're also the

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:43.860
term paddy wagon came from just

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:47.880
constantly resting enough they stopped

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.290
using carriages and just got like a

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:49.829
truck

00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:54.369
it's true like 40 people in the back mar

00:50:54.369 --> 00:50:57.099
ended up defending Corcoran and that

00:50:57.099 --> 00:50:59.709
like [ __ ] up his mug public life it

00:50:59.709 --> 00:51:02.140
kind of slowed down his his gigs

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:06.430
canceled canceled he was like I'm

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:10.059
pushing boundaries bro so there's like a

00:51:10.059 --> 00:51:11.410
national debate that the Irish couldn't

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:13.989
be trusted in uniform and definitely not

00:51:13.989 --> 00:51:16.180
as officers so they all started getting

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.160
kind of like kicked out as officers in

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.369
the army now what year are we in here

00:51:20.369 --> 00:51:25.390
this is it's got to be close it's

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:28.930
probably like 1858 okay nine yes getting

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:32.619
close actually 1860 so are they trying

00:51:32.619 --> 00:51:34.509
to they're starting to like rally up for

00:51:34.509 --> 00:51:37.420
is a war brewing do they know yeah so

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.849
what's going on now like there's a lot

00:51:39.849 --> 00:51:41.829
that led to this and I ended up writing

00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:43.390
down and listening to a lot of stuff

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:46.109
about like the start of the Civil War

00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:48.519
while Maher got cancelled he ended up

00:51:48.519 --> 00:51:50.529
selling his newspaper and he took his

00:51:50.529 --> 00:51:53.289
BAE down to Central America just went on

00:51:53.289 --> 00:51:56.979

Costa Rica met him and also he was doing

00:52:01.509 --> 00:52:03.009
diplomatic work on the side for

00:52:03.009 --> 00:52:06.549
President Buchanan it was in office at

00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:10.719
this point he was a he Jimmy Buck James

00:52:10.719 --> 00:52:13.839

yeah Ohio it a bunch others right yeah

00:52:43.029 --> 00:52:44.170
we could have had him what's that

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:46.630
Midwestern governor's right that's where

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.209
like that's the pipeline talking

00:52:48.209 --> 00:52:51.099
Midwestern just just around the corners

00:52:51.099 --> 00:52:53.679
a nice Midwestern senator by the name of

00:52:53.679 --> 00:52:56.979
Abraham Lincoln but no Jimmy buck was

00:52:56.979 --> 00:52:59.259
like a very James McCann was one of the

00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:00.130
worst presidents ever

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:03.060
also why rumored to be gay

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.560
ever had a first lady was the only

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.960
bachelor president really Jimmy Bach

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:10.740
dude what yeah so he was he ended up

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.750
being what's called a doe face which is

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:17.430
a northern with southern sympathies so

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:18.870
he was trying to like ease all this

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:21.180
anti-slavery shakers right now right now

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.760
and there's only like thirty states the

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.440
whole other side of the country is empty

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.630
yeah it's just territories California

00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:28.920
eventually gets added because of the

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.840
gold rush same thing we still like

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.060
Mexico at this point yeah it's like

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.760
Mexicans succession or so it was we

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.870
already had that like that war okay

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:43.080
but yeah so Jimmy bucks like when each

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.460
time they add a new territory they have

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.140
to decide if it's pro or anti slavery

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.890
mm-hmm and Buchanan's pretty weak on it

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:51.690
and he wants to keep everybody happy so

00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:52.800
he keeps being like yeah you can do

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.950
whatever like in Kansas he issues this

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:57.780
Constitution that's like you guys Kansas

00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.430
and Nebraska are the same territory its

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:01.520
Kansas Territory and he's like you guys

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.220
can decide yourselves which just results

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.530
in what's called Bleeding Kansas mm-hmm

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:08.910
but people to start fighting each other

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:10.290
just start fighting each other like

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:14.400
crazy yeah that's what we're gonna get

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.200
to John Brown a second cuz he was out in

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.870
Kansas his John Brown's son's around

00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:20.310
Kansas and they're like there's a lot of

00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:21.750
anti-slavery [ __ ] out here and he was

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:23.400
like don't worry dude I'm coming out

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.260
there that's a good place to start rides

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:27.240
out there they murdered like five dudes

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.380
with swords yeah they had wild [ __ ] John

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:34.020
Brown gets nutty also the Dred Scott

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:38.400
case happened in 1857 now you've all

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:43.950
heard that you know yeah Dred Scott was

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:49.650
a slave who his master in like 1830s was

00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:52.620
a military officer so the guy got

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.750
transferred all the time to different

00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:56.520
states different territories and each

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.900
different state had different rules on

00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:59.670
slavery so like he would go to like

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.980
[ __ ] Wisconsin which was free yeah and

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:04.320
still be a slave did he have like a

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.030
tight crew or did he have like a big

00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:08.130
group of slaves he was bringing from I

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:09.480
don't know it's just like I don't know

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.490
somebody housekeeper kind of stuff he

00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:13.320
had Dred Scott and dred Scott's family

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.190
and that's it I don't know yeah but

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:19.410
when that guy died he gave Dred Scott

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:21.690
and his family to his wife and that's

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:25.440
when Dred Scott filed a complaint and I

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.539
think it was in st. Louis my hands

00:55:27.539 --> 00:55:29.190
didn't like a free State in Missouri he

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:31.589
was filed a thing and they ruled the

00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:33.510
first hearing ruled that he was free and

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:35.460
then they took it to the Supreme Court

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.890
there and ruled that he was not free and

00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:39.780
then they took it to the National you

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.670
know the Supreme Court yeah and that's

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:43.260
where he's like state Supreme Court yeah

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:46.410
yeah so then you get the Dred Scott

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.920
ruling that was read by Justice Taney

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.609
yeah tani tani yeah who Justice tani was

00:55:53.609 --> 00:55:57.869
born in 1777 this guy's [ __ ] 80 years

00:55:57.869 --> 00:56:00.180
old he's on the Supreme Court and he

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:06.030
rules yeah yeah what high school is

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:07.859
great-grand right I saw like it was like

00:56:07.859 --> 00:56:10.619
a couple months ago I saw her host had a

00:56:10.619 --> 00:56:13.859
great great yeah she like was posting

00:56:13.859 --> 00:56:16.109
stuff on the Instagram or something

00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:18.539
about just like apologizing for she like

00:56:18.539 --> 00:56:20.339
gave like a speech you apologizing for

00:56:20.339 --> 00:56:22.230
her grandfather and like the decisions

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:26.220
he made yeah yeah it doesn't go Dred

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:30.420
Scott way justice Taney tani however you

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.750
say it also route like Buchanan Condit

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:36.809
was like supported this decision

00:56:36.809 --> 00:56:39.480
Buchanan when he got inaugurate

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.760
inaugurated he was like whatever they

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.859
decide on this case I will definitely

00:56:43.859 --> 00:56:49.920
support he wanted no problems sure the

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:54.359
the case ends up being that black people

00:56:54.359 --> 00:56:57.270
can't be citizens like it wasn't even

00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:59.970
about this guy as far as which state can

00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:01.170
accept this he's like their only

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:03.839
property and they can never be US

00:57:03.839 --> 00:57:06.359
citizens so that's a federal rule that

00:57:06.359 --> 00:57:07.950
was a loophole basically a baby well

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:11.940
yeah property can't sue is that yeah

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:13.500
yeah it's like you can't even file suit

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:14.760
because you're not a person

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:18.119
yeah it just divides it to the point

00:57:18.119 --> 00:57:19.770
where there's no middle ground either

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:21.779
the entire United States is pro-slavery

00:57:21.779 --> 00:57:24.029
or anti slit yeah there's no like each

00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:25.799
new territory you can debate this it's

00:57:25.799 --> 00:57:27.930
just like we have to it's just pushing

00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:30.059
closer and this is 1857 the war starts

00:57:30.059 --> 00:57:31.020
in 61

00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.810
so it's just like one of the last you

00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:36.720
know yeah there were there is no more

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.450
room for there's no debate words fail

00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:42.360
Supreme Court yeah

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.660
but yeah back to 1855 and Bleeding

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:48.240
Kansas John Brown that's when he wrote

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:51.090
out with his sons John Brown had twenty

00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:51.780
kids

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.600
well he had a dog yeah the same woman

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:57.090
one woman who gave birth to seven then

00:57:57.090 --> 00:58:02.180
he married a 16 year old who had 13 kids

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:05.250
Jesus she was four years older than his

00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:09.330
oldest son also imagine being a person

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:11.340
and then having people be like oh yeah

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:13.380
you're not a person you'd be like wait

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:15.780
what then what was rounds of honky by

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:17.820
the way John Brown honk John Brown's a

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:20.310
honky who's a black I don't know John

00:58:20.310 --> 00:58:22.920
Brown's a hard core religious

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.710
abolitionist yeah he's like a Calvinist

00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:28.410
dude he was raised by like a super

00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:30.210
religious family that's like slavery is

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:33.150
a mortal sin and it's you know it's a

00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:35.430
stain on this country how the [ __ ] I

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:36.510
thought John Brown was black John

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:38.280
Brown's a honky dude yeah I kind of

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:39.990
thought that too wait who's the who am I

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:44.130
thinking of nat Frederick Douglass rush

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:45.570
who's a slave that bum rushed and

00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:48.300
attacked a long time that's nat turner

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:51.420
but John Brown led he was trying to [ __ ]

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.800
John Brown a black know John Brown's

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:56.460
white John Brown starts yeah we can go

into him for a little bit he goes into

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:01.290
Kansas his two of his sons go out to

00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:03.090
Kansas write a letter back to him like

00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:05.070
it's [ __ ] crazy out here there were

00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:07.590
fights they were constantly townspeople

00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:09.540
would go in and murder people Pro and

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:10.800
anti-slavery people were fighting

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.720
everywhere I think that's where the

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.690
Jayhawks the name Kansas Jayhawks come

00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:17.280

anti-slavery people okay yeah I was

00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:23.190
gonna say otherwise that name would be

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:30.510
changed John Brown goes out with his

00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:32.550
dogs murders five dudes with like a

00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:34.470

owned rides them to Canada from Kansas

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:41.359
like in the winter which is nuts

00:59:41.359 --> 00:59:44.040
when easing Canada he'd like meets with

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:44.910
like Harriet Tubman

00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:46.800
and Frederick Douglass like he's like I

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.000
always thought John Brown was like a

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.310
[ __ ] lunatic that no one really cared

00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:52.040
about but he was like he actually like

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.420
boys with Frederick Douglass and like

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.390
talked to Harriet Tubman and she like

00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:59.190
she supported him but they were Harriet

00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:01.470
Tubman was like you need to [ __ ]

01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:04.260
chill cool your jets yeah why did he

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.640
kill five people with a sword was there

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.990
like something at stake or he was just

01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:10.110
like they were pro-slavery dudes [ __ ]

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:10.650
them up

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.510

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:15.120
small battles of like hundreds of dudes

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:23.190
fighting yeah yeah no yeah I bet Harriet

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:24.510
Tubman was like yeah you're gonna bring

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:26.400
the fuzz down like yeah that's what

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.020
Frederick Douglass told him he met with

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.550
Frederick Douglass and his plan in 1859

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:35.090
1859 was Harpers Ferry that's when he

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:37.560
he's like I'm gonna set up a stronghold

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.460
in the mountains in Appalachia and

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:43.590
attract free slaves or like it attracts

01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:47.760
slaves and start like a rebellion and he

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.080
met with Frederick Douglass to explain

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.310
that plan and Frederick Douglass was

01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:55.740
like don't [ __ ] get us in a lot like

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.350
we're gonna get killed for this yeah

01:00:57.350 --> 01:00:59.340
things are gonna be really bad for

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.240
slaves if you do this yeah

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.870
terrifying for Douglass I know your

01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:09.210
hearts in the right place don't haven't

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:10.620
you explained that to like a white dude

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.480
he's like no no it's gonna be trust him

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:18.120
before also John Brown had declared

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.100
bankruptcy like he just failed at every

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.860
business venture he had like 20

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.790
businesses that failed I mean he was a

01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:31.830
total fuck-up he was a [ __ ] in that

01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:33.180
sense but he also like they said he

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:36.080
worked hard and like yeah was just like

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:39.540
he was very stoic and very like I'm on a

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:42.870
mission from God to destroy slavery yeah

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:45.270

is to destroy slavery and all this other

01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:51.180
[ __ ] I'm a bad containers point it was a

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.160
like balance sheets and it's like

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.810
they're looking like it's like flow

01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:56.250

one more [ __ ] time yeah maybe for real

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.370
seriously dude it was like apparently

01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:06.680
Mark Twain was a shitty businessman too

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.570
for his whole life really yeah yeah so

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:12.500

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:17.840
who I was thinking about doing next No

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.530
we'll get the grant eventually John

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.390
Brown's kicking around John Brown in

01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:25.940
1859 is like here's the plan we're gonna

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.650
go take Harpers Ferry which was a

01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:29.840
federal Arsenal with thousands of guns

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.460
he's like this is this we need to take

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.240
this Arsenal to supply our revolution he

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.290
thought he was gonna get a lot of help

01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:38.980
they ended up only getting like five

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:41.450
free black dudes to join them

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:44.830
they all had wild names one of them [ __ ]

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:49.040
I'll think of it so him in five dudes

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.030
him he had 17 white dudes I think okay

01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:55.760
wild names like D'Brickashaw or like or

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.280
like a Native American no like crazy

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.640
like to brick it like Dred Scott like

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.560
his name Newby something Newby had a

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.830
six-story he was a freed slave that was

01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:11.990
joining up to raid Harpers Ferry because

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:15.590
his family was close by you know he was

01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:19.310
going to free his wife yeah oh [ __ ] yeah

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:21.380
he tried to Django Unchained it did he

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:25.190
he got killed right away killed right

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:27.770

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:31.010
Louisiana least he tried [ __ ]

01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:33.260
appreciate the effort yeah so anyway

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:37.730
Harpers Ferry fails they go in what's

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:39.460
funny is the town started shooting back

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.320
the townspeople just picked up guns and

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.230
started like sniping them three of his

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:47.110
sons were with him they all [ __ ] died

01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:51.100
they ended up hiding in like a fire hall

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.510
like that they set up shop in like a

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:56.570
fire department okay and like barricaded

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:57.560
the walls there was like four of them

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.310
left and the colonel sent down by the

01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:04.400
militia was robert e lee to go shut it

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.400
down robert e lee and Jeb Stewart led

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.150
like 80 Marines to the fire hall and

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:12.170
they were like Jeb

01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:14.329
Stewart went up to the door and was like

01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:17.450
hey you got a surrender and John Brown's

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:19.730
idea was like why don't you give us a

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:21.680
head start and then you guys can try to

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:25.520
catch us they're sort of stepped back

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.010
and waved his hat which was a signal for

01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:29.270
the Marines to he was like no you

01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:31.670
[ __ ] idiot and they sent the Marines

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:34.339
in which Robert Ely gave the order only

01:04:34.339 --> 01:04:36.829
bayonets don't fire your gun just go in

01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:40.609

01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:42.619
break in and you know stabbed to death

01:04:42.619 --> 01:04:44.869
yeah one guy got pinned up against the

01:04:44.869 --> 01:04:46.730
wall with a bayonet pretty [ __ ] sick

01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:50.799

01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:54.460
pretty Wow but uh John Brown got

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:59.119

01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:15.920
the best thing he could have been at

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.990
Harpers Ferry was a martyr yeah like he

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:20.270
compared himself to Samson yeah if you

01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:21.799

01:05:21.799 --> 01:05:24.740
gets captured by the Philistines the way

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:26.869

01:05:26.869 --> 01:05:28.250
tears the roof down and kills himself

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:30.410

01:05:58.309 --> 01:06:00.500
i mean i didn't this isn't part of this

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.900
but robert e lee was asked by lincoln to

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.660
lead his army and robert e lee was like

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:10.660
i can't turn on virginia on old virginia

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.309
anyway back to Marv during this whole

01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:15.799
thing who while he's down in Costa Rica

01:06:15.799 --> 01:06:18.680
he puts together a plan to lay out a

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.079
railroad that the US government would

01:06:21.079 --> 01:06:22.760
buy then connects the Pacific and

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.470
Atlantic meanwhile he's like I can get

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:26.640
paid right

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.310
yeah he like built like basically a land

01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:31.930
canal you know I mean like what the

01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:34.480
Panama Canal eventually becomes yeah he

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.680
was gonna have aliens

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.050
yeah Continental railroad yeah just down

01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:40.030
in Central America that like the British

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:42.340
and US government would fund and he was

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.720
close to signing the deal but then all

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.730
this [ __ ] broke out and that fell

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:47.620
through which ended up putting more into

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.210
like a deep depression where nothing he

01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:52.510
ever does happens like he just keyed

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:53.800
he's like maybe I'm just a [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.440
that goes around talking he doesn't like

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:01.150
a drunk depression so while Mars in

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:02.890
Central America that's when Lincoln gets

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:06.310
elected mark comes back in 1861 which is

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:08.790
Lincoln's first year in office

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:11.320
Lincoln hadn't been inaugurated yet he

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.750
just won the election as soon as Lincoln

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:16.210
won this is pretty crazy Lincoln wasn't

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:18.700
even on the ballot in Arkansas Alabama

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.890
Mississippi Texas Tennessee Florida

01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:22.270
Georgia Louisiana and North Carolina

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:24.430
wasn't even on the ballot for the

01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:27.310
presidential election he won but yeah he

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:30.490
got zero votes from those states they

01:07:30.490 --> 01:07:32.800
just straight-up really lose including

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:36.160
on it yeah whoa yeah but this was back

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.570
there was like a three-party system I

01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:38.860
think that know-nothings were running

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.220
Fillmore actually for a second time what

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:43.780
were they like the Whigs or something

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:48.820
yeah okay so before Lincoln even takes

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.410
office after he won the election in

01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:53.440
South Carolina on December 20th 1860

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.920
declares their their seceding from the

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.080
Union after South Carolina Mississippi

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.750
Florida Alabama Georgia Louisiana Texas

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:04.990
they all bail just before he's even in

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:08.470
office after he won the election and in

01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:11.530
those states slaves make up 47% of those

01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:16.060
populations pretty well yes I mean

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:21.850
there's four million slaves when Lincoln

01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:25.720
is inaugurated Taney that guy who

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:29.410
delivered that the Dred Scott he was the

01:08:29.410 --> 01:08:31.980
one who administered the oath to Lincoln

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:35.790
Lincoln you [ __ ] about it

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:38.230
yeah probably there was the Democrats

01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:38.680
Hey

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:44.380
Lincoln right and yeah Lincoln at his

01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:46.540
inauguration said I have no actually

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:49.240
here you do this Chris how do you think

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:56.230
Abraham Lincoln talked I have no

01:08:56.230 --> 01:08:58.330
brothers directly or indirectly to

01:08:58.330 --> 01:09:00.100
interfere with the institution of

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.670
slavery in the states where it exists

01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:04.270
that's all right

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:06.310
I believe I have no lawful right to do

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:11.140
so and I have no inclination to do so so

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:14.860
yeah that is not like I'm not gonna 1961

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:17.110
yeah he was like I'm not gonna in the

01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:19.000
states that already have slavery I'm not

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.440
gonna try to abolish that I don't think

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:23.230
it's legal for me to do that but in the

01:09:23.230 --> 01:09:24.700
new territories that's where he would

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:27.430
fight for it that's about where we're

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.050
gonna leave off mara wasn't sure what

01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:32.230
side he'd be on in the Civil War Cochran

01:09:32.230 --> 01:09:34.900
or DC's back in New York

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:40.090
okay corker and his boy was still in

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:43.510
jail mmm for not marching in front of

01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:45.070
the king and the north was the one who

01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:46.890
put him in jail

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.360
Mitchell's still down there rallying

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.280
he's got there's 80,000 Irish citizens

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.980
in the south and Mitchell's telling them

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:55.780
like [ __ ] join up where's Mitchell

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.460
headquartered Mitchell I think he's in

01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:01.030
Tennessee okay and whenever Maher and

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.650
his wife had gone down in the south they

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:04.720
love them they treat him well they love

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.840
the Irish down there but Maher on April

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.840
12 1861 found out exactly what he was

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.600
gonna do and this was the first battle

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.100
the civil war that broke out at Fort

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:20.920
Sumter in South Carolina and Maher was

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.260
like I'm [ __ ] done with the south

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:25.150
dude I'm gonna [ __ ] them off what pissed

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:29.530
him off it was probably something about

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:32.200
honor yeah maybe there's got to be honor

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.820
relatedly I don't think anyone died at

01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:35.800
Fort Sumter either he's shot at each

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.320
other for there was a federal fort in

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.150
South Carolina and they just bombarded

01:10:40.150 --> 01:10:41.470
it like bombed it for a while and

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:42.850
eventually they surrendered it was that

01:10:42.850 --> 01:10:44.770
like a star spangled banner where does

01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:46.360
this star-spangled is the war of 1812

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:51.190
okay I think in Baltimore um but yeah

01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:52.270
man that's

01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:54.460
so he just was like [ __ ] I'm fighting

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.400
with the north yeah he's from New York

01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.070
New York but he was torn and then I

01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:02.050
guess that was the one with something

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:04.330
like a calling hat like he just felt mmm

01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:05.980
because again he just got back from

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.530
[ __ ] Central America yeah and he was

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:10.360
like I'm a loser dude nothing I do works

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.310
and then as soon as the war broke out he

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:19.290
felt you know compelled to participate

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.030
yeah but yeah that's where we can leave

01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:24.190
off so now he's so he's he's gonna fight

01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:25.960
with the Union soldiers hey yeah

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.820
Corcoran just gets released from jail

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:30.130
they're like you boys why did they let

01:11:30.130 --> 01:11:32.110
him go the war broke down they're like

01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:37.210
yeah we leading the Irish Brigade let

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:38.380
them out we're gonna let these Irish

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.800
boys loose yeah but instantly enough

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.830
Mitchell's rallying a southern Irish

01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:47.290
Brigade I don't want to get too deep

01:11:47.290 --> 01:11:49.240
into it but I know for a fact they they

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.710
fight each other at Fredericksburg

01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:52.600
I don't know if Mitchell's leading them

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.970
or not but I know the Irish brigades

01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:58.720
shot each other in Fredericksburg well

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.400
just the southern dudes we're up on a

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.590
hill behind a wall just murdering these

01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:04.870
Irish dudes the other Irish guys kind of

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:06.220
a mess when you think that are crying

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:07.720
the whole time while they were doing it

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.550
really they're like those are our lads

01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:12.700
down there you take it all in the

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.130
context of like them starting in Ireland

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:17.320
getting butt-fucked by England coming

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.970
over here and there's fallen into little

01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:20.290
social circles and like we've got to

01:12:20.290 --> 01:12:21.460
[ __ ] kill you they're like what the

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.530
[ __ ] yeah man yeah I'm interested to

01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:25.690
know what what convinced them to do that

01:12:25.690 --> 01:12:27.220
because it seems like they go

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:29.740
Confederate all the way aside from the

01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:31.150
fact that there's a [ __ ] ton Irish

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:33.190
people in the north yeah and I mean a

01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:34.390
lot of the people in the north were just

01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:36.250
like hey we're gonna give you soup and a

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:40.300
dollar we're still running out of foods

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.430
are very serious and realistic so right

01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:44.800
now it's kind of like a cliche but even

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.720
in gangs New York like those dudes Irish

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.090
students getting off the boat and as

01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:50.140
soon as they go off the boat they're

01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:52.150
handed a [ __ ] rifle and a uniform

01:12:52.150 --> 01:12:53.500
they're like congratulations you're a US

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.090
citizen you're also in wouldn't I call

01:12:55.090 --> 01:13:00.460
that it's not shanghaied no no there was

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:00.850
something

01:13:00.850 --> 01:13:04.200
it's has a name like

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.620
it's like it being impressed into the

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:10.180
army but there's something else they

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:11.260
call it something that called it

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:12.610
something else where they were just like

01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:14.830
you're in and you don't have a choice I

01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:17.350
also forgot to include that Mar became a

01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:20.560
US citizen at this point a lot of the

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.199
pressure from the know-nothings was

01:13:23.199 --> 01:13:24.969
which was like getting rid of immigrants

01:13:24.969 --> 01:13:26.590
yeah he like had to do it

01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:29.320
so he's a US citizen at this guy also

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.850
there's some other wild [ __ ] that led to

01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:33.310
the [ __ ] build-up to the Civil War

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:36.850
like this dude represented from PA

01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:38.949
[ __ ] knocked out a boy from the south

01:13:38.949 --> 01:13:40.989
dude here's I'm not gonna let some

01:13:40.989 --> 01:13:42.520
[ __ ] [ __ ] tell me what to do and the

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.260
southern dude was like or the northern

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.790
it was like some [ __ ] slave driver

01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:47.949
piece of [ __ ] he'd [ __ ] punch them in

01:13:47.949 --> 01:13:49.750
the face it broke out into a brawl damn

01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:51.330
in the House of Reps

01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:54.130
then I get that going again dude yeah

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:56.710
these were in like Ukraine had some

01:13:56.710 --> 01:13:58.239
sayings break out into a fist fight

01:13:58.239 --> 01:14:00.460
these are brawls there's also a guy this

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:02.739
dude I think from Massachusetts Charles

01:14:02.739 --> 01:14:05.290
Sumner mm-hmm the southern dude like

01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:07.060
basically beat him to death with a cane

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:10.480
in in the house Jesus like it cracked

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.000
his skull open with a cane [ __ ] yeah

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.400
debating the slavery thing and then the

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.110
guy who did it I forget his name the

01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:18.910
southern guy like people would mail him

01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:20.949
new canes he came back with a cane that

01:14:20.949 --> 01:14:23.890
said do it again engraved in the pretty

01:14:23.890 --> 01:14:26.110
wild man it was I mean it led to a

01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:28.210
[ __ ] Civil War that's [ __ ] not

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:36.100
yeah well that's part too if you can sit

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:36.910
through it again

01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:39.190
yeah get to the Civil War well things

01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:43.719
are heating up where more is gonna he's

01:14:43.719 --> 01:14:44.920
gonna he's gonna lead the Irish Brigade

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:48.340
mm-hmm [ __ ] nuts pretty nuts so he

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:49.780
broke his cane on someone and they gave

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:50.920
him like a new one though and like

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:56.350
southern yeah no it's weird too they're

01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:58.060
conscripted so I think this is like

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.920
total aside I was follow are you have

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.410
you been following the Zimmerman lawsuit

01:15:01.410 --> 01:15:04.719
no he has never been suing the family

01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:06.460
one hundred million dollars yeah what's

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:08.320
the weird part was well there's a couple

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.420
things you know he sold his gun

01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:13.090
afterwards for $150,000 the gun he used

01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:14.770
to kill Trayvon Martin auctioned off for

01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:16.900
I think for $150,000 yeah see what you

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:17.450
get

01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:18.950
like the cane well it's similar

01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:20.750
everybody look just like morons being

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:24.050
like yeah yeah which is weird but he

01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:28.160
apparently there was a with one of the

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.080
key witnesses there's a documentary a

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.120
guy did the guy who did dreams of my

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:32.660
father

01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:34.250
we were like said like Obama was

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:36.920
actually the song like yeah that guy

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.540
said that like indian-looking bit what's

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:41.750
his name Dinesh D'Souza yeah the guy who

01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:43.670
dreams of my father I don't know I don't

01:15:43.670 --> 01:15:45.500
know my father

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.810
that was a book Oh bummer yeah that's a

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:49.670
book okay nevermind there so that my bad

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.170
there was another the guy did a

01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:52.940
documentary about Obama being the son of

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.070
like a communist not his dad the guy

01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:56.810
they the one they say he's his dad in

01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:58.400
dreams my father's guy think no it's not

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.650
he did another documentary saying like

01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:03.410
the key witness was Trayvon Martin's

01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:05.840
girlfriend he's not who it is and he

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.330
like a pair allegedly proves this to be

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:10.700
the case they used a fake witness in

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.980
this and then they show the night the

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.360
night on one tapes and apparently

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:17.030
they've been cut up and spliced so I was

01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:18.500
through the suing his family but the

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.300
weirder part is there's I was watching

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.620
the thing they're saying like people who

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:23.660
like these work measured individuals who

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:25.130
watched it they're like yeah I know it's

01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:27.290
[ __ ] up but he might win this case

01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:31.580
which is gonna start everyone's laughing

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:32.900
it off but apparently if you watch this

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:35.840
video but the guy where did you use is

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.130
this one of those things this is lose

01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:40.160
that guy when Larry I trust Glenn Lowry

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.160
yeah Glenn Lowry and John McWhorter or

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.050
like they're like you are pretty so not

01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:46.670
you don't get sucked up into the [ __ ]

01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:48.250
yeah yeah worst part is they're like

01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:50.360
they're like do the worst part is we're

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.640
just kind of like [ __ ] me they're like I

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.500
hope this isn't true but you watch it

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.990
yeah yeah because that was their latest

01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:58.370
podcast right it was like revisiting

01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:00.650
Trayvon dude that's a good series

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:01.520
two-parter

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.380
that would be crazy if it was like what

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:05.840
was that guy who like the accused of

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.820
killing his wife and everyone was like

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.500
always guilty like dyed his hair blonde

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:13.430
and like just remember this yes and it

01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:15.230
was like I just assumed that he was

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:17.840
guilty and but apparently look at that

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.100
then there was a documentary where he

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.410
was like totally innocent I mean this

01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:23.480
dude he definitely definitely did it but

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:24.650
they're saying like the circumstances

01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:26.300
reported it was that guy's name he's

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:29.889
looking out for it well

01:17:29.889 --> 01:17:32.320
it reminded me that no no no it's all

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:37.479
good yeah that wasn't a story I di

01:17:37.479 --> 01:17:40.300
wanted to organize this more but this

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:41.679
stuff there's a lot to get through it's

01:17:41.679 --> 01:17:43.630
like yes so much and then I got into

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:45.760
Dred Scott in Kansas and John Brown

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.939
yeah just keep so much that leads up to

01:17:48.939 --> 01:17:50.919
the Civil War and it also it's you hear

01:17:50.919 --> 01:17:52.570
people be like it's not all the Civil

01:17:52.570 --> 01:17:54.070
War is not about slavery it was entirely

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:56.320
about yeah yeah why do people say that

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.959
anyway I don't know

01:17:58.959 --> 01:18:01.149
well there is like people would fight

01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:03.280
for the south on behalf of like states

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.039
rights and like defending your home so

01:18:06.039 --> 01:18:07.209
like a lot of the soldiers didn't give a

01:18:07.209 --> 01:18:08.619
[ __ ] about slavery most of them didn't

01:18:08.619 --> 01:18:11.499
have slaves yeah but but it was about

01:18:11.499 --> 01:18:14.079
like a state right to the shoes what I

01:18:14.079 --> 01:18:15.399
wanted but it was there's also a lot of

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:16.989
people in the North that suffered

01:18:16.989 --> 01:18:19.689
greatly with the abolishment of slavery

01:18:19.689 --> 01:18:21.459
like all these factories in the North

01:18:21.459 --> 01:18:25.329
that were using cotton yeah and like

01:18:25.329 --> 01:18:27.070
Thomas Jefferson thought slavery would

01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:28.719
just die by itself like he wrote that

01:18:28.719 --> 01:18:30.099
it'll just have a natural death like

01:18:30.099 --> 01:18:32.590
it'll we won't need it then it was

01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:34.749
getting close to that and then the

01:18:34.749 --> 01:18:37.209
cotton gin got invented and they're like

01:18:37.209 --> 01:18:38.739
holy [ __ ] and the United States became

01:18:38.739 --> 01:18:40.989
like the lead producer of cotton in the

01:18:40.989 --> 01:18:45.489
world yeah [ __ ] yeah but then they knew

01:18:45.489 --> 01:18:46.840
that would they would need less slaves

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:49.059
in that situation right no they did know

01:18:49.059 --> 01:18:50.709
you can just make you can do more with

01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:52.899
the cotton oh you just still had people

01:18:52.899 --> 01:18:56.380
picking it right yeah yeah but yeah

01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:57.880
