abortion abortion episode was an

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.580
abortion itself was a bit of a double on

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.540
time that was a [ __ ] rough one

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.800
she did like a marching band

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.640

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.650
me that seems we've we've we've covered

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.790
that we've got me this is a very

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.209
pro-life here I'm not yeah I was on the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.430
tumblr you're on the chat block that's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.350
one that's a good thing so was a the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.380
Honorable prophet Minister Farrakhan he

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.660
was on the Johnny yo that was one thing

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.100
he hit people with you it's just like

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.470
honestly he's like my mom tried to abort

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.030
me and I got to live with that for the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.590
rest of my life and it kind of flux with

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.660
me and anyone who is for abortion if

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.620
you're like what if you found out your

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.350
mom wanted to abort you they'd be like

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.180
yeah yeah so either way either way do

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.769
you think but think about though

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.230
I think Tim Tebow really think about

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.420
getting an abortion picture the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.700
Honorable Minister Farrakhan yeah if you

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.440
can band you can look at the Honorable

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.269
Minister and still go through with it

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.250
you can imagine life without Farrakhan I

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:25.920
can't I can't what was I gonna say I was

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.090
getting down to business here talking

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.980
about Pythagorean sama Thakur and we

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.690
used to worship numbers we all know that

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.859
so big cool way to think about numbers

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.569
well let's get into it do we know what

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.950
you guys are all about I want to figure

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.720
out I mean I've tried to follow to the

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.880
events and I've learned that I'm pretty

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.950
bad at I mean I am an investigative

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.410
journalist but I'm pretty bad at like

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.750
following the chain of events but the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.160
Epstein stuff it's kind of old hat by

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.930
now yeah we kind of miss the news cycle

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.180
there we're doing America I guess I'd

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.130
like to miss the new cycle and let stuff

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.750
develop because it's like everyone just

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.609
jumps on it it's actually becoming in

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.319
vogue now I've noticed a lot of people

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.569
are [ __ ] like I saw a hot chick doing

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.310

tinfoil hat now and she just started

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.150
going off and she was info no that's cuz

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.690

here understand where do you stand on

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.639
all of it

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.000
well there's a lengthy note so my called

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.479
a manifesto stuff for the top let me

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.219
hear you what do you got well it's like

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:17.439
so I don't think that this dude would

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:18.460
punch his own ticket

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.499
there's no way sure that the guy that

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:23.379
worships transhumanism saving his sperm

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.779
up for like the elite women to have

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:27.729
babies with there's no way this dude's

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.439
like oh I want to die right now unless

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.939
he figure out how to make himself a

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.129
sperm cell okay then he told himself

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.110
okay slithered out he's like something

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.500
out of Irish folklore yeah it makes

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.969
sense a transhumanist typically aren't

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:41.740
that suicidal dude typically craves

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.529
immortality I can't imagine a scenario

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.270
where he's paying off guards to kill

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.399
himself that's not gonna work that way

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:52.779
yeah once he hired two Nigerian brothers

00:05:52.779 --> 00:06:07.180
do unplugging from the matrix yeah this

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.129
is the red pill the country's swallowing

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:10.360
red pills dude the only people that are

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.339
believing that I've seen killed himself

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:13.689
are people that have never been locked

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:15.460
up the second you get locked up dude

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.250
belt laces go on yes no way you're

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.250

like to be hang himself in because I'm

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:26.379

everybody else for us and the Mossad

00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:06.159
goes against the United States wishes do

00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:08.529
the US military like Trump just

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:17.830
installed the next guy in LA the next

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.839
person in line so they run something I

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:21.310

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:26.680
CIA or whatever it is the next person

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.050
that was in line it got bypassed by

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.189
military intelligence

00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:33.279

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.949
dude Trump was like hey by the way we're

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.000

it's military intelligence military

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.229
intelligence super like they keep an eye

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.569

stuff so C so Epstein so Maxwell was

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.230

her dad was Robert Maxwell some kind of

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.160
a media mogul Yeah right then she was

like a young heiress all this yeah and

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.800
in the Epstein things she's one of the

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.630
co-conspirators and she would recruit

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.910
girls mm-hmm and the girl that they

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.090

Prince Andrew that's in the [ __ ]

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.280
works dude dan so if you want to think

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.570
about who would have got to have seen

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.880
which I think everything's not dead

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.400
they'd stolen them out of that yeah I

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.740
think Trump took them out because the

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.690
Royals would have got to him wait they I

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.010
could I could see them pull them out

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.960
from CIA military intelligence do you

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.760
think they snuck them out well they

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.230
either took him out and they as a

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.500
message to the Mossad as a message to

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.750
the old CIA as a message to the black

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.510
nobility over in Europe yo listen I know

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:03.290

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.600
was black nobility is like all black

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.920

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.920

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.280
that exactly the Royals mighty came

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.080
after him and by the Royals I mean the

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.910
powers that be I mean people say some

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.230
people say the Queen stands North

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:46.040
America okay so were we ever free whoa I

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.870
wonder about that if they didn't just

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.040
little bit like all right they win the

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.210
Revolutionary or whatever Peter's like

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.550
this new regime of it the new regime of

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.350
the Royals they're [ __ ] full-on P at

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.330
Peter so London Garden they all loved

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.390
human sacrificing weight when they're

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.040
like 20 years ago in the London Guardian

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.050
there's like you have Epstein's island

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.610
but then you have other islands where

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.470
they do human sacrifice I mean dude you

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.030
see Naomi Campbell's Island that's

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.290
[ __ ] weird oh yeah you saw the

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.030
picture of the girl who was the sex

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.270
slave at Naomi Campbell's party - oh

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.650
there's a picture in the new in the new

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.510
york times of at one of the girls was

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.160
complaining and SEPs teen she was at

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.590
Naomi Campbell's party Nami Campbell's

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.270
and frame right there first of all did

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.970
you know islands are eight knowing this

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.860
I'm surprised - Wow

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.150
well they're probably more expensive if

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.680
you're gonna have like a child sex ring

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.890
on them you're gonna sell young on here

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.520
like na na young trim eight mil run hit

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.560
through 16 mil probably gonna get a

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.710
license yeah I mean like a child ability

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:49.100
yeah I think that definitely that we

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.710
took him to protect him put he's in

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.690
witness protection as a message to them

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.550
like they know they didn't get them

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.280
they're like what because yeah what's

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.520
the alternative age that weird like my

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.140
thing but they know that's not I notice

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.250
Epstein's body didn't have that

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.820
hook-nosed

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:13.740
he did know the body had one body the

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.680
body was swapped out did have the nose

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.990
yeah the body had a very Jewish nose

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.160
somatic knows for sure

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.890
Oh they say they recreated that's layers

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.600
so they tried to recreate it what's his

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.760
nose look like it's Epstein bro come on

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.870
[Laughter]

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.290
I think it was like a shark nose going

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:41.430
through the sacrifice to do that they

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:47.370
can make them anyway I think I think

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.040
that they stole them as a message to

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.570
everyone else being like we got him now

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.720
yeah and the reason I think that is the

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.320
guy that did the autopsy did JFK did the

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.780
OJ Simpson stuff right and the reason

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.160
I'm saying it's a message is like it's

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.950
so obvious because they dust off that

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.830
they JFK autopsy guy that's kind of like

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.620
Trump's CIA being like say that guy

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.360
still doing autopsies yeah well he was a

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.860
young yeah because he did it on the

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.140
plane right he's gaze off autopsy was on

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.060
a plane if she's all time he was switch

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.610
his body was switched that's what I'm

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.410
saying that's a message to the elites is

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.500
like this is another body switch I'm

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.000
saying that no that's true well the

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.950
other thing too so people can go body

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.650
switch that's crazy but to think that he

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.150
legitimately hung himself on suicide

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:41.820
watch that's the crazy thing if you will

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.470
think that's ridiculous and it's like I

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.750
still don't understand how people I will

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.970
say this so we'll say this I in Phoenix

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.220
this weekend every time I got onstage I

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.280
was like well like to open a big

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.810
Clinton's killed Epstein the whole place

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.520
would laugh and glued like everybody

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.740
agrees yeah everybody knows like the

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.810
whole these are regular people

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.310

and they're like are you opposed to

00:28:58.099 --> 00:28:59.989
military tribunals he's like no if

00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:01.519
someone committed that we would go

00:29:01.519 --> 00:29:03.349
through military tribunals I'm sitting

00:29:03.349 --> 00:29:05.029
there like oh my god who's talking about

00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:08.239
this cue that's the other thing

00:29:08.239 --> 00:29:11.720
talk about this forever Wow has it been

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:17.239
wrong at either I would like you to just

00:29:17.239 --> 00:29:19.849
go over that Accord Obama might bullet

00:29:19.849 --> 00:29:21.259
point that I'll get into the next part

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:28.129
where you think the white race is just

00:29:28.129 --> 00:29:28.820
being fresh

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.559
you are being fresh you are being so you

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:32.149
think this kind of thinking leads to

00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:33.619
that kind of absolutely not I'm right

00:29:33.619 --> 00:29:36.349
there with him dude he's 9 so you're

00:29:36.349 --> 00:29:39.249
just going you're just going for yucks

00:29:39.249 --> 00:29:41.419
the other thing I want to say was when

00:29:41.419 --> 00:29:44.330
Epstein first got in trouble W was

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:47.179
president and he had a good relationship

00:29:47.179 --> 00:29:48.349
with the Queen and he made it all go

00:29:48.349 --> 00:29:50.330
away and what they were pushing for was

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.789
on a race between Hillary and Jeb that's

00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:55.729
a win-win for the royal crew also think

00:29:55.729 --> 00:29:57.440
about this dude if Hillary got in

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.479
epstein would not I got into trouble no

00:29:59.479 --> 00:30:03.830
no no to raised all this weird stuff if

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.429
she if she won that's her dog dude that

00:30:07.429 --> 00:30:08.539
would not if she would have squashed

00:30:08.539 --> 00:30:10.159
that we would never have heard I believe

00:30:10.159 --> 00:30:11.960
that it's so funny that we're actually

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:18.169
rolling up I mean there literally is a

00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:21.440
global child saying your children's sex

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.909

00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:24.109

suicide no one really believes him

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.820

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:37.430
sloppy pedo

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.430

all this cuz it that's been like shut

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.910
that you know all the New York Times

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.730
Elana Colette yeah one more good this is

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:01.080
this is going well if we're back on

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.380
Michael Jackson yeah so the first night

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.000
I came on stage they played the Jackson

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.700
5 in Phoenix and then I was making ha I

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.180
was Isis you know about the implications

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.490
it was everybody liked it I was like

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.500
which is funny because little Michael

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.700
was probably older Michael's type you

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.839
know I mean if there was some sort of

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:25.260
looper oh yeah we're older Mike got to

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.650
hold a little Mike what song was this

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.589
was a play Jack ABC is great [ __ ]

00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.890
song

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:36.000
great fun songs you're saying Michael if

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.740
there was a looper if there was a looper

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.809
he'd go back and he would get a little

00:37:39.809 --> 00:37:42.240
Mike whatever you do yeah big whatever

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.910
you do do not mess with yourself and

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:52.530
he'd be like all right he just goes back

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:53.849
in time nothing ever happens these

00:37:53.849 --> 00:37:55.530
remembers himself touching his butthole

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.079
[Laughter]

00:37:57.079 --> 00:37:59.250
because a lot of sexual predators start

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.920
from getting you think he made upon

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.079
maybe MJ invented time travel he

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:07.410
moonwalks [ __ ] himself and then became

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:10.319
a predator very true that checks out so

00:38:10.319 --> 00:38:14.160
I don't believe that I want to be when I

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.569
have my kid I want to be like the Joe

00:38:15.569 --> 00:38:22.290
Jackson of like podcast kids Joe Jackson

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:24.869
beat his kids that's Matt's black side

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:26.119
coming right now

00:38:26.119 --> 00:38:32.490
Jackson you do nothing wrong kids taught

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:34.230
them discipline taught them how to dance

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.180
well

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.130
how do you know this it's like that ball

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:39.540
came out that I used to beat the [ __ ]

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:44.099
out okay that's a damning accusation I

00:38:44.099 --> 00:38:50.609
was surprised how many dads [ __ ] their

00:38:50.609 --> 00:38:52.530
daughters and when the oldest one grows

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.150
up and moves out they just go to the

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.670
youngest one no apparently like I said I

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.559
was reading the that stat from that

00:38:58.559 --> 00:39:03.660
thing before and there I was reading a

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.790
stat before and they are saying jagged

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:09.109
Miller dude from a CDC sample they did a

00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:11.309
people with like it was either eating

00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:13.020
disorder or some kind of disorder 37

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.819
percent of them had been molested that's

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:18.119
a huge try that was like 23 uses a

00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:23.190
sample of 20 - yeah for sure

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.720
well it's one of those things - when

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.590
like you

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:27.240
you start to get close with people you

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.830
become like legitimately terrified that

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.120
they're gonna like that's why I'm like

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.460
kind of late not that jammed up about I

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.960
mean this is gonna sound bad but like

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.180
the girls that are sold into sex slavery

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.010

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.180
people that SIOP the little kids for

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:55.860

evil no there's it's like it's like

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:04.320
teaching a man to fish in the opposite

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.810

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:08.130
there was a guy who was kicking around

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:19.470

girls so they were virgins and they got

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.550
sy opt into this and that's why they're

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:28.110
the real criminals all the guys are

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.730

Psychopaths they want power so the I

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.880
mean the downfall of all great

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.200
civilizations assume it's like a

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.040

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.730
become vampiric on the children

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.770
somebody said max won't be a procurer

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:23.000
Renfield rent someone who goes and gets

she's on there's people on there

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:26.580
multiple people in the record coming at

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:27.150
her for that

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.280
yeah and supposedly she's ready to talk

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.020
but I don't believe it I believe when I

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.790
say she just like browsing the Fashion

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.940
Bug I mean how do you top lifts their

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.670
[ __ ] from fashion boat it's like a store

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.450

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:42.329
I am from a Chris O'Connor what do you

00:41:42.329 --> 00:41:43.530
want who care

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:44.790
Maxwell needs to be persecuted

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.400
prosecuted that's one where the red

00:41:47.400 --> 00:42:04.260
pills in Swami even dude that's yes so

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.369
we're putting the picture together

00:42:05.369 --> 00:42:06.930
Maxwell you think they're actually going

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:08.940
to probably make a show out of yeah most

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:09.900
of the time she would have been

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.510
Epstein's handler from Mossad so he was

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:15.270
he was he was their operative she was

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.430
the handler they never get in trouble so

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.260
whatever she's gonna say is fake can I

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.780
ask what so you think the Mossad Mossad

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:25.770
did this do you think the Jays did yeah

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:28.290
why would they do it to have the das

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.510
honest yeah yeah yeah it's just there

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.990
she is

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.000
so what I like the most powerful people

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.040
yeah so the British gave him a country

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:35.700
and they ain't got their own

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:36.720
Intelligence Agency

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.180
yeah I know that but I'm saying why not

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.579
our Intelligence Agency doing this why

00:42:41.579 --> 00:42:43.559
is it why does it have so we have our

00:42:43.559 --> 00:42:45.720
own it's not the CIA doing this we have

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.210
our own stuff going on but they think

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:51.450
that he's Mossad Epstein yeah well if he

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:53.579
is an operative from Mossad he would be

00:42:53.579 --> 00:42:55.020
an operative for anybody cuz he's

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.180
compromised across the board so the CIA

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.160
got a hold of him they would be like you

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.480
work for us now what a life though

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.430
you're getting that but he started out

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:04.589
with Jews a Maxwell and she's her dad

00:43:04.589 --> 00:43:06.809
was Mossad so that's why they're saying

00:43:06.809 --> 00:43:11.599
he's on yeah I was wondering where the

00:43:14.299 --> 00:43:16.260
cod might work for us

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:23.990

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.430

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.650
so we can have more than one way that's

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:13.239
[Music]

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:22.200
why Muslims are so good it's why the

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:29.070
Muslims are so good I have to speak to

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:32.250
the management now different why I'm

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:40.710
just like I will put the dishes away yes

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:42.690
I did not forget to vacuum the steps as

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:55.590
well he's telling us this we're like

00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:57.630
what the [ __ ] dude 60 he's like that's

00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:59.940
what I told her it's forbidden cuz you

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.040
need to get your wife's consent in order

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.320
to get a second wife you gotta show this

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.650
to your wife check this out so he was

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:08.700
like I don't think it's hard to get

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.960
Muslim woman's consent he's trying to

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.400
paint the picture like it's even-steven

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.140
even though I was dying to be like well

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.120
can your wife have an extra husband but

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.590
I was I didn't want to rock the student

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:21.000
you were gay you can crash the car

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.210
immediately

00:50:30.709 --> 00:50:31.789
the profit would have been on the island

00:50:31.789 --> 00:50:38.419
and he said he says that Muhammad

00:50:38.419 --> 00:50:40.789
married a girl 20 years younger than him

00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:43.369
to protect her but I was like she's he

00:50:43.369 --> 00:50:49.309
was 29 I heard that on Airtel Road not

00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:56.509
good you have impure thoughts and you

00:50:56.509 --> 00:50:58.189
get hard you can rub your boner on their

00:50:58.189 --> 00:51:02.150
thighs and stuff Mohammed the Quran

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:08.839
yeah half of the book also is like six

00:51:08.839 --> 00:51:21.739
jugs of wine there's a wagon of gold

00:51:21.739 --> 00:51:23.299
chalices behind the music what are the

00:51:23.299 --> 00:51:24.529
gold chalice is about is like there's

00:51:24.529 --> 00:51:32.319
nothing just a small gift on the rug

00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:43.640
he's like so I'm like we're asking like

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.049
wait so you got to screen this through

00:51:45.049 --> 00:51:46.699
your wife and he was like yeah man

00:51:46.699 --> 00:51:48.469
that's why I'm mad at my wife because

00:51:48.469 --> 00:51:50.179
basically and this dude it's a

00:51:50.179 --> 00:51:51.349
legitimate thing to go to your wife that

00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:52.939
you're not giving me enough sex I need

00:51:52.939 --> 00:51:54.949
enough sex therefore get new wax do

00:51:54.949 --> 00:51:56.659
another Muslim guy work with Jalil told

00:51:56.659 --> 00:51:58.039
me about Muslims got this year right yo

00:51:58.039 --> 00:51:59.959
this guy goes he goes well look man and

00:51:59.959 --> 00:52:01.429
they said he saw he defends it he goes

00:52:01.429 --> 00:52:03.529
well look you guys know men are stronger

00:52:03.529 --> 00:52:08.900
in sex than women mostly you basically

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.999
by being like a man needs to come more

00:52:10.999 --> 00:52:12.529
than we're stronger in sex did our

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:14.239
boners hurt we need to come all the time

00:52:14.239 --> 00:52:16.999
go to your wife and he goes for example

00:52:16.999 --> 00:52:21.140
my wife has a cousin that has four kids

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.179
and no husband I could marry her she's

00:52:23.179 --> 00:52:25.579
23 years old but and we were like yeah

00:52:25.579 --> 00:52:26.839
dude you wanna get some [ __ ] go it's

00:52:26.839 --> 00:52:28.249
not about pussy's about protecting her

00:52:28.249 --> 00:52:31.429
that comes later so you can marry like

00:52:31.429 --> 00:52:32.959
so you can go to your wife know how to

00:52:32.959 --> 00:52:34.519
protect your cousin maybe absolute was

00:52:34.519 --> 00:52:36.869
just trying to protect everyone

00:52:36.869 --> 00:52:38.279
he's a bit of a protector like Chris

00:52:38.279 --> 00:52:40.469
Kyle's only get much like Chris Kyle

00:52:40.469 --> 00:52:42.299
instead of Stephen you think he was uh

00:52:42.299 --> 00:52:44.160
but dude Epstein was only getting

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.200
massages so maybe he's just rubbing his

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.460
boner on him maybe I've seen was a

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.349
Muslim maybes whole thing's a farce

00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:51.660
there is you know they are trying to

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:55.769
push them push Muslims on us whoa what

00:52:55.769 --> 00:52:57.660
who is yeah you know that's like a whole

00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.339
thing like that's like a whole theory

00:52:59.339 --> 00:53:01.380
trying to push Muslims into countries

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.989
because it deval it breaks up the family

00:53:03.989 --> 00:53:09.930
turns into socialism socialist Muslims

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:12.630
love families Muslims are incredibly

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:15.690
yeah oh you're saying the the the law

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:17.999
the difference in law like real law yeah

00:53:17.999 --> 00:53:20.700
then you enter shows you're allowed to

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.309
marry multiple wives under Sharia laws

00:53:23.309 --> 00:53:24.989
that's that's the question okay that's

00:53:24.989 --> 00:53:26.279
the question of multiculturalism if

00:53:26.279 --> 00:53:31.140
Muslims move in America can they have we

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:33.329
allow multiple wives yeah so I guess

00:53:33.329 --> 00:53:40.019
yeah you would be like whatever it's

00:53:40.019 --> 00:53:43.680
just like wait what about just somebody

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.319
be like you just build a [ __ ] wall

00:54:00.529 --> 00:54:03.329
that keeps spinning North now but the

00:54:03.329 --> 00:54:05.009
cool thing is the dude so the whole

00:54:05.009 --> 00:54:06.269
thing is the girl

00:54:06.269 --> 00:54:07.920

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.569

gave her like this I'm not saying that I

00:54:17.489 --> 00:54:19.200

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.390
four kids and she needs it's like that

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:23.190

whole thing of honey patan was like a

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.060
that was a conspiracy theory of itself

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:28.300
like the CIA bringing people in to like

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:30.790

they've been doing this [ __ ] since after

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.619
World War two so there's records of this

01:00:41.619 --> 01:00:43.960
actually there's dudes that think that

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.000
Woodrow Wilson was compromised into

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.599
letting the IRS exist so where we had

01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:51.490

01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:08.450
the malt in the energy drink malted

01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:10.340
beverage village from it nobody comment

dude a couple of young innovators him in

01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:14.420
his boy were meek their college revealed

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:21.830
the invisible hand take the market very

01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:24.920
Adam Smith in alpha brain dude they uh

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:27.200
so his boy Remmy quirky like he's a

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.880
airplane mechanic he was actually told

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:29.870
me a lot of [ __ ] about airplanes I

01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:45.010
didn't know but he had airplanes down

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:56.180
the blades use tell he was explain to me

01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:57.860
how the air system works you know you

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.110
turn it little nipple you know you turn

01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:03.670
a little nipple and the air comes out

01:20:08.650 --> 01:20:35.360
like while you sit in the chair you turn

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.520
those little things little air vents we

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:40.820
call he was like you know the air comes

01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.830
from and I was like I don't like a freon

01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:45.050
I thought I was all smart like closely

01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:48.580
on system for him a [ __ ] idiot

01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:51.020
he was saying that it's like their

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:53.780
turbine the one thing spins so there's

01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:55.310
heat coming from the engine and then

01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:56.720
they there's stuff that's spinning so

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.520
fast that it also generates cold air

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.470
those two streams of air mixed together

01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:03.050
and create like a nice like tepid like

01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:05.420
coolish air that hits you he's like it's

01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.530
entirely perfect sense

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:09.960
because when I'm on the runway and you

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.270
have the nipple on it's not a warming

01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:13.740
your chuckle for the devil

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:16.620
everyone's warm but you know when the

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:18.990
planes not moving as fast it gets the

01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:21.330
kind of crazy man so he's either way so

01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:22.950

it's like this is a good internal family

01:34:26.050 --> 01:34:28.590
systems is my new thing so you recognize

01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:31.600
within yourself there's a family of sub

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.810
personalities that are constantly that

01:34:34.810 --> 01:34:37.000
arises adaptations to protect the child

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.440
inside that's pretty much like a SEAL

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:52.180
team there's no just Crisco that's way

01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:58.840

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:10.360
interesting fact I've been spewing a lot

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.650
that I think might be wrong

01:35:11.650 --> 01:35:13.990
there's no SEAL Team six was our first

01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:15.640
SEAL team wha-oh

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.860
during the Cold War so we were like what

01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:20.440
SEAL team number six we got a bunch of

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:21.730
these [ __ ] this is only number

01:35:21.730 --> 01:35:26.770
six you guys don't even know that's the

01:35:26.770 --> 01:35:28.360
level of like deep state that we're

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:34.000
talking about Trump had done 19 in

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.070
Africa 19 SEAL Teams he did 19 see boys

01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:42.490
in Africa that's cuz the Chinese are

01:35:42.490 --> 01:35:45.640
finest haikon check you know it's crazy

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.320
and I hate the braids that all the

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:48.850
listeners but we're at war with China

01:35:48.850 --> 01:35:52.630
really yeah China but it just became a

01:35:52.630 --> 01:35:54.850
hot war just became a hot war because

01:35:54.850 --> 01:35:56.740
they just invaded their own people in

01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:58.720
China Hong Kong you are we have an

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:00.670
American flags the UN is waving American

01:36:00.670 --> 01:36:03.550
flags because or the Hong Kong is waving

01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:05.110
American flags they were British for a

01:36:05.110 --> 01:36:07.540
hundred years yeah and now they're like

01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:09.750
what the [ __ ] is this Chinese [ __ ] yeah

01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:12.850
Britain worked out with China so like

01:36:12.850 --> 01:36:16.380
they're like British people that I call

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:25.820
they also suffer from lack of space lost

01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:27.650
all their rights but they're they're

01:36:27.650 --> 01:36:30.380
into the English law and all that they

01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:32.210
have Western culture they know what it

01:36:32.210 --> 01:36:32.540
is

01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:36.830
so we're babe concept I heard somebody

01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:38.840
drove a bumper car straight through all

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:46.130
the protests portions were injured

01:36:46.130 --> 01:36:49.840
[Laughter]

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:52.430
fortunes are being treated my way fling

01:36:52.430 --> 01:37:03.830
the body part with the last name that's

01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:14.300
even your head going clear bills like

01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:18.550
take the shot take this abort abort

01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:21.020
so yeah that's a good point so we're at

01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:22.100
war with China

01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:24.590
20 big 5g comes in to all that I don't

01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:26.420
know I think that's a sigh of it back it

01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:30.110
up a bit they physically drove like I

01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:32.240
think they're called Mr P's whatever the

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.740
bunch of motorcycles which couldn't be

01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:39.860
funnier they drove I don't see many

01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:41.480
Asians on motorcycles down you're doing

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.400
the [ __ ] cool movies never see Asians

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:48.500
almost well I'm in [ __ ] [ __ ] I take

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:53.390
that back still i RL yeah drift through

01:37:53.390 --> 01:38:06.500
their [ __ ] that was Bill burr just go

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:10.910
straight for the so we're at war with

01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:15.290
China because they just invaded Hong

01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:17.450
Kong and which is part of their [ __ ] but

01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:19.400
that will be a UN thing so there's gonna

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:22.460
be a UN agreement that that breaks the

01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:25.700
geneva thing so this Trump is jumping

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:26.810
about running for Congress

01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:30.140
is better than those other for his job

01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:31.940
about to go argue with Chinese people in

01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:33.710
front of the UN they do a real-life

01:38:33.710 --> 01:38:35.180
Model UN you know I don't have the

01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:37.190
articulation for this but don't worry

01:38:37.190 --> 01:38:39.170
about there's gonna be there's gonna be

01:38:39.170 --> 01:38:40.850
a thing where they're at the UN going

01:38:40.850 --> 01:38:42.560
this is not right and they're gonna say

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.560
who's gonna fix it Trump daddy I mean

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:46.880
they're gonna ask for American help

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:48.320
that's why Hong Kong's gonna appeal to

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.850

River with your horse he would have been

01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:27.860
like saying you're going to the moon big

01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:31.940
ok dude I mean I mean I imagine if I

01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:34.100
just out of nowhere imagine if I was

01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:35.449
like I'm gonna ride my bicycle to

01:42:35.449 --> 01:42:37.460
California you'd be like dude you see

01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:41.840
first man on HBO now so on first man so

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.400
I don't know what you thought about the

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.800
Apollo program but like you know there's

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:46.850
a pile of 13

01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:50.900
yeah and Apollo 11 okay so how much time

01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:53.270
do you think went by in between Apollo 1

01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.840
and Apollo

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.170
13 I know I did 10 15 years yeah dude

01:42:57.170 --> 01:42:57.980
like a year

01:42:57.980 --> 01:43:01.670
what yeah it's not nuts so in Apollo how

01:43:01.670 --> 01:43:03.440
did they name it 13 dude in the Apollo

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:06.500
program what they did was every time

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:09.199
they fired off a [ __ ] little like a

01:43:09.199 --> 01:43:12.739
part of the mission yeah like so say the

01:43:12.739 --> 01:43:14.119
first part of the mission was just just

01:43:14.119 --> 01:43:15.710
going up into space that would be Apollo

01:43:15.710 --> 01:43:18.739
1 yeah so like the difference between

01:43:18.739 --> 01:43:21.800
Apollo 1 and Apollo 13 was like or the

01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:23.420
difference between Apollo 1 and Apollo

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:25.880
11 was not that long maybe a year and a

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:28.790
half okay is that nuts yes really we're

01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:32.230
like Neil Armstrong watched his boys die

01:43:32.230 --> 01:43:34.790
they burned was Apollo 1 the Challenger

01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:37.969
no pot no Apollo 1 was like oh they were

01:43:37.969 --> 01:43:38.690
the guys okay

01:43:38.690 --> 01:43:40.540
that's the David Bowie song yeah I mean

01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:47.659
hopefully she knows [ __ ] but anyway so

01:43:47.659 --> 01:43:49.639
he watched him burn to death and heap on

01:43:49.639 --> 01:43:51.980
movie first man he watches him burn to

01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.449
death and he has to go up like eight

01:43:53.449 --> 01:43:55.190
months later but in our head Jesus

01:43:55.190 --> 01:43:57.199
Christ you say like Apollo 11 Apollo 13

01:43:57.199 --> 01:43:58.760
we're imagining like years are going by

01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:02.060
dude it's like weeks yeah they ran the

01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:03.590
space program like boom boom we were in

01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:05.570
an intense cold war with Russia and then

01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:07.460
we're spending half the GDP on space

01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:09.139
that's pretty so that's actually

01:44:09.139 --> 01:44:10.429
something I can get behind and when they

01:44:10.429 --> 01:44:12.849
keeps all the fight about that

01:44:12.849 --> 01:44:15.230
conspiracy curious are like why don't we

01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:16.550
go back to space it's like dude we used

01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:18.860
to spend half the GDP on it it's like if

01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:20.210
we do that now we could go to the moon

01:44:20.210 --> 01:44:22.340
but it's like what the [ __ ] are we gonna

01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:27.139
do up there I mean I'm excited they

01:44:27.139 --> 01:44:28.550
should let this billionaires figure out

01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:30.349
this pastry oh yeah the Israelis just

01:44:30.349 --> 01:44:32.060
sent up something with the tardigrades

01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:34.310
on it and the things survived on the

01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:35.599
moon you ever see those little bad boys

01:44:35.599 --> 01:44:36.469
what are the barriers

01:44:36.469 --> 01:44:51.440
tardigrades what is that can I get a

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:57.270
scoop out it isn't made of cheese

01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:59.440
there's Jews on the moon they don't even

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:05.550
have bialys a good deli to get catfish

01:45:06.119 --> 01:45:09.040
right now tiny organisms all funny right

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:21.880
now yeah that's crazy it's a song yeah

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:23.020
we were talking you were talking about

01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:25.960
dudes going west don't let any towards

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:29.110
your full retards in every time the [ __ ]

01:45:29.110 --> 01:45:31.119
right now if I could writing a covered

01:45:31.119 --> 01:45:34.179
wagon is I would say arguably harder

01:45:34.179 --> 01:45:35.800
than me riding my bicycle I was watching

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.830
a movie with Michelle rooms with

01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:40.179
literally zero down and like I could

01:45:40.179 --> 01:45:43.690
stop at gas stations and buy food and it

01:45:43.690 --> 01:45:44.949
was you still big you're out of your

01:45:44.949 --> 01:45:47.369
[ __ ] life

01:45:47.409 --> 01:45:49.000
so I'm watching this movie I'm sitting

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:49.900
there thinking like all right you're out

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:52.239
there with your bay engine engines come

01:45:52.239 --> 01:45:53.980
upon you the Red Baron yes and you're

01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:55.810
like talking to them but you're fully

01:45:55.810 --> 01:45:57.909
autistic and even the Indians are like

01:45:57.909 --> 01:46:00.219
all right dude and they [ __ ] let you

01:46:00.219 --> 01:46:08.739
go you think like Lewis and Clark and

01:46:08.739 --> 01:46:10.060
[ __ ] like everybody that got what three

01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:11.710
times your needs are just like they

01:46:11.710 --> 01:46:13.719
start rattling off facts about wagons

01:46:13.719 --> 01:46:17.050
you know that's 13 spokes we have 16 you

01:46:17.050 --> 01:46:18.909
know good I am at our tree I've fixed my

01:46:18.909 --> 01:46:22.270
wagon four times true that is true I

01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:24.400
think Indian Native Americans would have

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.650
gotten down with autists back then for

01:46:26.650 --> 01:46:31.119
sure they'd be talking about savages

01:46:31.119 --> 01:46:33.369
that also had Down syndrome true they

01:46:33.369 --> 01:46:35.320
don't talk about that do you think that

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:36.730
went down thank you

01:46:36.730 --> 01:46:38.199
do you think that wasn't unchecked I

01:46:38.199 --> 01:46:41.940
think that's how Custer got crushed

01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:44.409
what never getting a mosaic Down

01:46:44.409 --> 01:46:53.230
syndrome almost regular is like so

01:46:53.230 --> 01:46:57.099
possible it's all the actors the actors

01:46:57.099 --> 01:46:59.110
that are down syndrome have mosaic Oh

01:46:59.110 --> 01:47:01.239
God like I said most actors are retards

01:47:01.239 --> 01:47:05.380
but there was no sort of deep so most of

01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:08.530
the most down sand reactors have the

01:47:08.530 --> 01:47:10.120
mosaic but it's like mosaic

01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:12.460
disabled it's like they're soaked little

01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:14.710
Z thank you big a dude that's how I

01:47:14.710 --> 01:47:17.500
spell it little D no no the there's a

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:23.200
book this book the in different stars

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:25.480
above about them going west yeah it's

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:30.430
it's unbelievable you don't walk your to

01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:33.070
walk whoa you weren't in the wagon like

01:47:33.070 --> 01:47:36.820
one person was yah stand and walk

01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:40.210
through the middle of the country oh you

01:47:40.210 --> 01:47:41.770
see I saw was called Miller's Crossing

01:47:41.770 --> 01:47:45.790
by the way there's also like kids get

01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:47.560
off and wander into the grass the grass

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.390

tallest [ __ ] you just lose kids it's

01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:52.420
like swimming to England people would go

01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:56.520
out and you just lose the absolute

01:47:59.010 --> 01:48:04.870
essential PA do we used to go out to

01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:30.989
might have been this guy was like oh I

01:49:30.989 --> 01:49:32.640

01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:34.830
and he sold a book that was like here's

01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:36.960
the secret passage out west it was just

01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:37.560
made up

01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:41.400
it was a hellish pass so they're trying

01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:42.719
to go through the Rocky Mountains and

01:49:42.719 --> 01:49:43.980
then they get here with him [ __ ]

01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:45.750
winter actually was the Sierra Nevadas

01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:47.940
it wasn't even the Rockies they got just

01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:50.040
I mean that was the equivalent of like

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:51.900
internet dick pills back then it really

01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:53.760
want your dick to be bigger than a

01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:55.260
tartar guys that live in like Illinois

01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:58.590
we're like well I'm a failure here I'll

01:49:58.590 --> 01:50:00.239
give this whole going less thing because

01:50:00.239 --> 01:50:01.920
you had to fail on the East Coast to go

01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:11.100
well sure kind of like in comedy civvies

01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:14.310
won't get it but uh when they found the

01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:15.989
Donner Party and [ __ ] they were like

01:50:15.989 --> 01:50:18.210
snowdrifts they were so odd that so they

01:50:18.210 --> 01:50:21.690
were they got trapped in snowdrifts so

01:50:21.690 --> 01:50:23.730
like [ __ ] you you're trapped in there

01:50:23.730 --> 01:50:28.949
with like three or four people I do it

01:50:28.949 --> 01:50:31.199
much you I dude munched they they would

01:50:31.199 --> 01:50:33.630
look the people who found them looked

01:50:33.630 --> 01:50:35.730
into a pit and found people munching

01:50:35.730 --> 01:50:38.460
people and then we're like we got just

01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:39.120
killed these people

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.520
yeah like the first [ __ ] they had to

01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:43.710
argue that they somebody saved them

01:50:43.710 --> 01:50:45.360
because the racial slur dude for

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:48.480
Italians no Wendigo is a Indian for the

01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:50.520
people that you know the people well he

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:52.380
had like a literal debate between like

01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:54.630
the party the searching but the party

01:50:54.630 --> 01:50:56.640
the rescue party to kill them or not

01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:00.420
Indian save them no oh the white but

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:01.890
they were like we need to kill these

01:51:01.890 --> 01:51:03.030
people because of what they've done

01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:04.410
yeah they're eating and they were like

01:51:04.410 --> 01:51:06.060
even like it wasn't like a kill like

01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:07.679
they were mad there was just a mercy

01:51:07.679 --> 01:51:09.239
kill they were like they're out of it

01:51:09.239 --> 01:51:10.980
yeah yeah they're gone put them out

01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:12.210
because they're they're out here they're

01:51:12.210 --> 01:51:14.219
eating like children what's in cabinets

01:51:14.219 --> 01:51:15.989
they got snowed in that also makes sense

01:51:15.989 --> 01:51:17.820
though it makes like see you see that's

01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:19.530
a death I'm see people eating each other

01:51:19.530 --> 01:51:21.390
in a hole yeah you're like I you know

01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:22.949
others ditch let's wipe the slate clean

01:51:22.949 --> 01:51:25.350

01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:30.570

01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:34.710
pedophile for the most part really it's

01:51:34.710 --> 01:51:36.719

the people that listen the caste
