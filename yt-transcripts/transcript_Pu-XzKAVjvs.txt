00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.369
what it's called the shitty paper they

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:31.960

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.009
the toilet they had it you know wipe

skipped $8.00 an hour I to empty that

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.289
bucket into the trash can so like the

00:19:41.289 --> 00:19:42.940
toilet paper would stick to the bucket

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.409
it would blow catch wind and blow

00:19:44.409 --> 00:19:46.899

we live in the wilderness so we actually

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.950
I live next to one of my cousin's

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.390
there's ten kids and their family we

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.330

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.190
[ __ ] Trump compound it's not a

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.260
trouble how much of your family voted

your whole family likes Obama love what

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.380
do they think of

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.570
Obamacare love Obamacare that your

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.060
family likes Obamacare makes it easy for

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.370
small businesses to afford makes it easy

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.990
for small businesses now it's actually a

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:15.700
kind of a disaster yeah let's see you

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.260
hear that you hear those little you can

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.970
[ __ ] ask them enough questions and

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.490
you get that you takes three questions

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:22.900
and you crack the [ __ ] white

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.070
supremacist code and that's you so tell

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.420
mister because the story is great I'll

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.110
shut the [ __ ] up Matt Matt is not racist

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.420
although the thing he is he is very

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.930
critical of Asians I think that's

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.580
something we need to work on I am NOT

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.980
and hopefully the free thinker hopefully

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.450
the Philly Comedy Network gets ahold of

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.510
this podcast and has a nice debate and

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.770
because they do need to calm you down

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.810
people need to [ __ ] okay pull the

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:50.980
leash a little bit cuz you're out of

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:51.400
control

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.750
well Shane hates girls but yeah my my so

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.430
basically I grew up next to all my

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:00.790
cousins and uh you know oh I think all

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.200
of us are kind of a little bit on the

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.610
spectrum there would you say I can't

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.520
autism yes you guys are all other than

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.840
that and that's the [ __ ] run to the

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.440
bunch but always looking like six eight

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.210
giant monsters just oh my whole family's

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.610
Giants I'm small but unlike real jacked

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.840
and ripped but the but yeah so we're all

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.070
kind of on the spectrum there at

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.110
Smallville come on not small look if

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.450
you're a normal human better my Monstars

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.400
family yet the rest of your family is

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.480
gigantic

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.900
just big idiots and uh but now they're

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.760
cool but anyway so we're all like you

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.950
know kind of on that little prism of

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.470
specialness as you guys grew up in a

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.270
[ __ ] compound in the woods yeah I

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.100
mean I only knew my cousin did you say

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.030
used to torture frogs yeah Mike walked

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.350
up to the pond one time and one of my

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.990
cousins was dissecting a frog with a

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.570
ripped off piece of a soda can so I was

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.040
like oh that's cool and then I came and

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.290
he helped me actually I felt a frogs

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.750
beating heart in my hand out of its

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.600
chest holy [ __ ] dude I can tote that

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.630
[ __ ] frog you need to change I was

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:05.680
young I didn't know I know

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.870
that's what's that's what's tough about

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.940
you like it's tough to blame a [ __ ]

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.100
yourself to blame you now for those

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.480
things I'm a savage Oh dad just boarded

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.690
to the firebase

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.220
take frequent do now up there's another

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.889
one I was definitely talking again I'll

00:24:21.889 --> 00:24:25.940
be parting into the microphone I've put

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.539
on no shades guy those dead scallops are

00:24:29.539 --> 00:24:31.220
clawing their ways out of a holy [ __ ]

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.129
they really are also you ripped the

00:24:34.129 --> 00:24:35.149
frog's heart out

00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:36.500
that's okay so I can't oh the Frog

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.759
that's besides the point so let's just

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:39.470
set the tone I can't okay know a

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.889
talented broke cane toad that frog and

00:24:41.889 --> 00:24:45.649
so basically in recent news at this

00:24:45.649 --> 00:24:47.269
compound this very special place from

00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:50.210
which I came so our one cousin named

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.870
Ajax you know he was uh I don't know he

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.429
just like I said before we're all kind

00:24:55.429 --> 00:24:56.899
of on that special little spectrum he

00:24:56.899 --> 00:24:58.340
was just the easiest to push in the pool

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.679
so it was definitely like the most on

00:25:00.679 --> 00:25:03.759
that one yeah they don't test for

00:25:03.759 --> 00:25:06.559
anything not mentally at the mckusker

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:08.570
commodity they just as new just go to

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.789
school and that's [ __ ] easiest to

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:13.580
push in a pool yes the furthest through

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.110
it he did throw a metal bat at us once

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.419
why he was on his way to a job interview

00:25:17.419 --> 00:25:21.470
and he dumped water on we threw a bucket

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.320
of water he's picking up a metal bat

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.870
through her head and we had a hip check

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.610
so luckily I think that hit me man how

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:33.350
do visi go to the bucket we don't know

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.389
on a different t-shirt who's trying to

00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:37.250
get an interview job at Wawa and you

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.379
threw a bucket of water on it if you are

00:25:39.379 --> 00:25:42.379
the worst guy like second I don't know

00:25:42.379 --> 00:25:43.519
we even know he's go to a job interview

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:49.549
oh yeah like a Metallica t-shirt we do

00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:51.440
it bad at her heads dude that thing hit

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.090
us out of Ben Stephen Hawking this

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.610
podcast right now it's like yeah I love

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.340
to eat [ __ ]

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.899
there are many [ __ ] in the universe

00:25:59.899 --> 00:26:03.200
that Jesus Christ why are you doing this

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.059
you can't do this

00:26:05.059 --> 00:26:06.980
do what what you're doing you can now

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.450
you're making Hodgins he's a Jesus

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.399
ability she said disable he's a genius

00:26:10.399 --> 00:26:13.850
he's clearly disabled no he's not are

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:14.929
you defining him by his physical

00:26:14.929 --> 00:26:19.190
capabilities yes that's exactly what I

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.139
was just saying how smart he was so

00:26:21.139 --> 00:26:24.500
anyway so yeah so basically recently at

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.669
the compound

00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:27.860
there was a so my other cousin lives

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.559
behind where our parents live back like

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:31.490
up a driveway

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.320
drive away goes from asphalt to just

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.030
stones that's kind of where it gets a

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.490
little while back there and so my cousin

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:38.960
had this he has animals and there was a

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.400
goose back there that got loose

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.140
I don't know I think my other cousin

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.850
dropped it off and it was a raging goose

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:48.290
it was trying to buy it was nibbling

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:53.870
some nibbles some of the children a lot

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:57.740
of kids there too so my cousin he

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.630
commissioned Ajax the one we dumped the

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.570
water on who had just gotten in how did

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.580
you get that job at Wawa oh he worked a

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.730
while before he actually they had a a it

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.340
was like employees like a safety zone

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.390
what does that call them they don't have

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.610

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:26.890

freaking out so you know Ajax takes his

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.100

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.929

hired an autistic dude with a bone arrow

00:27:47.929 --> 00:27:50.840
to kill this [ __ ] goose that could be

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.910
that could be the I don't think I think

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:55.640
he's more like a I don't know I don't I

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.900
know you don't want to say it cuz he's

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.760
your family doesn't well you know

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.020
something wrong with it but you don't

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.460
know you don't know it was gentle middle

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.650
I think it's more as Berger II which

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.809
that's whatever Alton yeah I [ __ ] you

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:08.179
the witch McCoy so yeah so he

00:28:08.179 --> 00:28:11.090
Commission's my cousin so I other

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.679
cousins having a little party up at the

00:28:12.679 --> 00:28:14.030
house and he has his little boys there

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:14.929
and there's you know a couple little

00:28:14.929 --> 00:28:16.940
kids I'm a little boy party up at the

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.470
condo boy party nothing nothing to be

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.700
easy starting to rest a couple little

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.280
boys maybe a girl or two little girl

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.770
hugging this guy anyway so come on I'm

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:25.730
saying there's a little girl and boy

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.160
you're the one inside a nice [ __ ] you

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.900
said it's a little boy party a little

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.760
boy party cuz it was just they have sons

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.530
I don't know we have strong genes anyway

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.980
so the so my cousin Ajax comes over

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.620
yonder with a bow and arrow and just

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.380
[ __ ] it doesn't impales this goose in

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.700
front of these children and the arrow

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.260
goes right out of it

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.809
so he takes another arrow out hits it

00:28:47.809 --> 00:28:50.500
again right through this thing

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.280
so all little kids are obviously

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.840
watching my cousin passes probably I got

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.919

his big gripe was he just bought those

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.750
arrows so he's losing so he went up he

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.220
