excited to be here actually i am excited

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.840
to be here today because this is such a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.160
great episode i've been dying to put

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.239
this one out and you guys are gonna love

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.199
it um and if you don't [ __ ] you

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.960
that's all i have to say

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.600
i decided to in my intro talk about

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.519
fears again because

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.200
a lot of you have been writing and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.400
actually no one has but i just wanted to

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.240
say that because it sounded like i was

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.439
important

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.080
and um so let's just play with that idea

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.600
that a lot of you have been writing in

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.439
and saying that you deal with a lot of

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.320
fear and i do too so don't feel like

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.200
you're alone nobody that's written in

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.159
um you know i am filled with fear a

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.960
field i am filled with fear a lot of the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.320
time and i understand your pain you know

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.799
it is hard to be a person that is filled

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.000
with fear

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.439
and uh i i feel like i've been dealing

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.960
with that for a many years i uh i i

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.439
wasn't like that as a child so much uh

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.240
this is my manager calling uh but i'm

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.680
not gonna take the call cause i'm doing

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.720
the intro for my podcast uh

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.399
so i'll have to give him a call back

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.600
anyways uh i i've been dealing with fear

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.840
a little bit more because of this virus

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.960
and the

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.439
uh one of the things that i fear a lot

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.120
in my life is uh clams i've been uh

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.440
feeling a fair clams for since i'm

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440
basically because since i became a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.560
lesbian

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.040
uh deal with the i can't talk like that

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.280
i'm drooling literally

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.040
i can do a good southern accent but i

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.640
just started to drool

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.560
and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna keep

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.160
doing it if i'm gonna drool at the same

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.080
time it's

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.640
i can't drool while i'm doing the intro

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.319
of my podcast even though some of you

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.920
aren't watching this you're listening

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.760
and it's fine if you listen i'd rather

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.640
you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.680
listen

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.319
like i'd rather you listen and do

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.680
something

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.480
to i can't think right now

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.720
this is so confusing it shouldn't be

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.680
confusing but i'm tired

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.000
but i'd rather you listen than not do

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.519
anything at all but you really should

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.200
watch this too

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.680
um but i'm not gonna drool

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.040
while i talk

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.519
i'm not doing it that's bad

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.840
that means i'm not okay

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.040
and i'm not drooling because of the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.800
medication i'm drooling because i'm

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.040
doing an accent

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.319
[ __ ] that took too long to explain

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.040
oh my god i hate myself

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.560
all right anyway

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.080
um i

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.159
i have a fear of clams i don't like

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.959
clams i don't like

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.599
i don't mind when they're closed

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.360
because it's just a shell but when

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.360
they're open it's very

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.159
scary to me do you fear clams

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.040
frank or paul no i don't

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.720
great i don't eat them either though i'm

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.040
not a big fan of shellfish but

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.720
i don't fear them have you ever eaten a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.440
clam yeah it wasn't for me it was too

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.840
like i knew you were gay i don't

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.080
i don't like the texture it's too

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.360
snot-like

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.560
did you have to say that

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.879
did you have to say the word snot i mean

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.799
most of the people listening

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.120
just freaked out that you just said snot

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.879
i know that because i'm very aware of

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.400
what people go through

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.920
emotionally do you think they're also

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.080
afraid of clams well i i think they just

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.760
got freaked out when you said snot

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.400
all right i'm sorry it's okay

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.680
it's okay

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.799
you can edit that out i will okay

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.040
uh paul and alex first paul i love clams

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.199
i love eating all right really yeah

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.960
linguine clam sauce would be on the

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.120
shortlist for like my last meal

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.400
that's a lot i love for your last meal

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.520

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.759
world really linguini and clam sauce

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.759
what would what would the other thing be

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.759
if someone that's to say that would be

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.680
your last meal is really intense

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.080
uh chicken parmesan sandwich might be on

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.639

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.360
thank you

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.759
you had such a better childhood than me

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:04.960
it was really

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.080
quite nice

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.240
i mean shut up and just tell me what you

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.639
think of clams i love clams i love clams

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.160
i love oysters i love mussels

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.880
and they're nicer than the mushrooms

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.479
i don't was there something in your

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.080
childhood you think that led to a fear

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.520
of claims

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.800
um

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.120
maybe

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.440
well

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.520
i don't know it could be so many things

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.440
maybe that i was forced to swim in a

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.680
lake

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.440
i don't know like a scary movie or

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.440
something you saw maybe

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.600
attack of the clams was there a movie

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.360
attack of the clans no but you said it

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.880
you're only afraid when they're open so

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.120
maybe that's like symbolic of an open

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.800
maybe i maybe i don't like that i'm gay

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.880
maybe that's what it is it's internal

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.479
homophobia i'll say it i'll say on this

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.560
goddamn podcast

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.240
maybe i haven't accepted that i'm a dyke

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.319
and i wish that can you tell everyone in

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.280
that [ __ ] studio that i am doing my

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.680
podcast and my stepbrothers the star of

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.440
scrubs

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.120
i'm joking alex you don't have to tell

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.440
them that it's there's there's a small

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.720
space

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.639
for a lot of us because i haven't been

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.479
picked up by a huge studio yet

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.720
i'm joking they're now they're telling

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.880
everyone to be quiet it's okay i'm not

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.720
important enough

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.280
jess you're our priority i know you guys

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.199
take very good care of me and so does

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.759
gas digital but just so everyone knows

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.680
we're in a we're in a cardboard box

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.680
right now this isn't even a like this

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.000
there's no it's there's cardboard around

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.880
us

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.120
we all had a crawl in here

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.960
and um

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.880
there's basically just

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.720
this that's why i'm always in front of

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.479
this little green screen there's like

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.280
not a lot in here

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.440
it's just basically like strings and

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.319
like

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.759
it looks bigger than it is

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.800
i'm trying to be funny today and it's

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.280
not i feel like i'm bombing and i'm very

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.440
upset about it but i'm not gonna eat

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.599
over it i'm only gonna i'm gonna eat a

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:20.160
romaine salad after this

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.240
i'm not gonna let you guys

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.919
make me hurt myself

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:27.039
because you're not laughing

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.840
jess i'm curious do you like clams like

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.520
i know you're afraid of them being open

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.440
but if somebody de-shelled them for you

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.080
would you enjoy eating them no no no i

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.400
don't i'm very fearful of them

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.039
i don't i don't i feel like

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.280
i feel honestly once they're open i feel

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.360
like they're going to snap at me

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.360
and i think that's symbolic about women

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.599
that i've been with

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:52.160
i just figured the whole thing out

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.080
i feel like once clams are open they

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.680
don't shut the [ __ ] up like they're j

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.639
it's that's what it is what it's like a

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.479
woman that

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:02.479
when you're when they finally when you

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:05.120
open them up they don't stop talking and

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.199
they just snap at you that's really what

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:08.639
it is

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:11.039
did you only realize this fear once you

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:12.720
were in relationships

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.919
yeah once i get close to a woman and i

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:19.360
like they open up to me

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.479
they just they snap they don't stop

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:26.240
and then i just want to i want to shut

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.639
them down again i want them to stop

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:30.639
and leave me alone don't put this as a

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:33.519
clip on instagram

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:35.519
please all right i won't

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:38.719
i'll get canceled by

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:41.839
everyone no just women men won't i'll

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:43.599
get more male followers if you put this

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:45.680
out so maybe that's good

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.480
because

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.440
that's who listens to podcasts mostly

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.080
no women listen to

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.200
oh god this intro sucks

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.720
another thing i'm fearful of is intimacy

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.200
i have a huge fear of intimacy it scares

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.959
the [ __ ] out of me do you guys too

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.200
i don't mean to wake you do you guys

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.600
have i you guys just [ __ ] napped in

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.680
30 seconds but all of you were just

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.720
napping

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.800
um no i don't have a fear of intimacy

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.360
yes you do frank okay i do

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.600
paul

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.040
i don't think so

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.120
great linguine and clam sauce chicken

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.519
farm no i don't have any problems alex

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:30.160
uh so that's weird i think i definitely

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.560
do but i also i'm like quick

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.120
to get into things like i

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.360
i have a fear of it but i still roll

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.000
with it yeah yeah me too

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.080
but that's what lesbians do like once

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.000
you say hi to someone you're scissoring

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.680
and you live with them

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.000
i'm i feel that way as a straight woman

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.800
which is way more unfortunate i think

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.080
yeah because then you're with a man just

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.800
attached to some random man that

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.240
complimented me

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.720
at one point really yeah i mean i don't

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.360
know it sort of feels that way sometimes

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.279
yeah i just get into things really quick

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:05.279
i'm like all in

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:09.200
i know i get it are you all single

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.959
i just thought of something when i wrap

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:13.920
up this intro which has been funny and

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.839
horrible

00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:18.640
it's been both it's been really funny

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.959
and horrible at the same time but we're

yeah are we admitting things now

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.520
yeah what's going on i feel like i can

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.600
tell you anything i'm usually really

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.360
[ __ ] uptight man

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.120
a lot of people in college

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.840
yeah

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.279
women's volleyball team in college

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:34.960
i used to do this thing where i would be

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.440
a fun game yeah when everybody was at a

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.440
party in like a dorm room i would turn

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.640
the lights off because we didn't have

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.480
windows in some of the dorms so it would

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.480
be pitch black yeah i'd be standing by

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.159
the light switch and i'd take my clothes

00:25:46.159 --> 00:25:47.840
off

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.360
yeah and then go

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.720
flip the lights

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.880
so they got a glimpse of it

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.799
oh that's not just my p it wasn't my and

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:56.240
it wasn't like a sexual thing it was

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.640
just because i was i'm gross looking

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.679
naked right it was just very funny to

00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:03.760
make everyone like jesus right like a

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.520
nightmare and it was a nightmare and

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.360
then i got a little older and i realized

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.520
that was probably

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.200
bad to do

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.480
you know

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.679
yeah never got really any complaints but

00:26:15.679 --> 00:26:17.440
someone once asked me if i had to

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.760
compare my body to like

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.400
an animal what would it be what would

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.960
your animal be

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.000
i don't know that's a tough one

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.520
i don't know

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.760
maybe like a llama

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.520
you think yeah

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.400
i love llamas llamas are good

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.320
i've

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.400
i'm quite piggish

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.760
flesh fleshy piggish yeah

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.520
how about you

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.760
oh

00:26:48.159 --> 00:26:50.080
an ostrich

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.720
yeah actually

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.320
yeah that's pretty good

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.400
i i'll admit something because you just

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.400
did yes

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.320
i once uh

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.240
one of my little cousins

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.159
was once in a baby icu

00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:08.000
and uh i was alone in there and i

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.679
flicked my dick around in front of the

00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:11.600
babies

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.919
and i've uh i've had shame about that

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:15.840
but since you just told me that you

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.559
showed half your town your dick

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:21.200
i don't feel so bad anymore man yeah so

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.520
you they get you had access to the

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.000
baby's intensive care unit yeah i mean i

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.679
was there alone

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:29.760
the nurses were like had their backs to

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.000
me and it was were they in

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
like the incubator type thing yeah man

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.760
you get to smear it across the glass

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.080
yeah i just smeared you

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.919
yeah yeah you smeared your dick

00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:42.480
on an incubating glass of dying babies

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.760
yeah yeah and then i uh i shot a load on

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.799
one of their blankets but it's all right

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:50.960
they didn't know they have no idea in

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.320
fact they're probably dead the baby

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.080
probably died well it had no eyes

00:27:56.159 --> 00:28:00.799
so didn't have eyes no that baby didn't

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:03.520
maybe maybe it lost its eyes because its

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.559
dad shot its load into them

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:10.880

should do it and then if you bomb just

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.079
ignore it and if you keep bombing for

00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:23.280
like

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.560
a decade yeah keep going

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.920
him is that i've been doing a lot of

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.680
lifting who are some comics that you

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:59.200
think you could beat the hell out of uh

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.359
obviously every every lady louis gomez

00:57:01.359 --> 00:57:03.920
is a [ __ ] [ __ ] i mean he's a nice

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.799
guy but i could take him

00:57:06.799 --> 00:57:08.640
i know andrew schultz has been doing

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.640
those [ __ ] punching videos yeah

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.440
[ __ ] take that kid out yeah

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.599
i could beat up uh

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:17.839
joe rogan with my hands tied behind my

00:57:17.839 --> 00:57:19.119
back

00:57:19.119 --> 00:57:20.799
could just headbutt him

00:57:20.799 --> 00:57:22.319
yeah you could sneak a headbutt you

00:57:22.319 --> 00:57:25.119
should go to a club yeah if if all right

00:57:25.119 --> 00:57:26.640
so if comedy doesn't work out like we

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.240

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.920
you should work

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.960
if it doesn't work go to a club yeah see

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.200
a comic that's doing well yeah find the

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.119
one that you think did the best go up to

00:57:37.119 --> 00:57:38.839
