[ __ ] committed

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.600
they don't play dude well they weren't

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.880
too committed because she's a real pile

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.800
from like the west philly border

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.199

no it's upper darby by 25 feet but you

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.320

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.759

about who has the video well she

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.639
there's another interesting aspect of

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.800
her getting shot so she had been with

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.560

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.440
and i didn't realize we were this close

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.840
but apparently we got close as she be

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.520
as she was on the mend from getting shot

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.520
where'd they shoot her uh in the abdomen

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.080
ooh

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.479

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.080

guy's like

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.960

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.479
first person to just get shot in the

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.639
stomach since [ __ ] oswald

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.240

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.479
60 year old kid from west philly dressed

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.200
in an old white suit and wait for to her

[Laughter]

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.600

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.120
boyfriend for about four weeks at the

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.520
time

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.880
and for some reason she uh she gave me

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.240
this information that

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.000
they consummated their relationship

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.840
while she was on the mend

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.600
um but they didn't consummate it the

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.840
typical way uh she let hanal

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.560
yes what what because she was on her

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.400
period at the time so it was just

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.680

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.800

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.160
in that order yeah a dream cast

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.360
did that come out in like 93 man

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.040
i had no idea what was what it looked

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.120
cool so i bought it now you you were a

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.399
troop also

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:08.560

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.839
yeah you were in the service

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:11.920
oh you were i was but then i stopped

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.600
going

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.240
[Laughter]

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.639
i wasn't aware that was an option you

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:18.240
can do it if you're in the marine or if

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.240
you're in the reserves you can do that

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.120
um i i feel like i've set the trend like

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.560
i'm kind of the rosa parks of quitting

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.800
the marines

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.199
so i signed up in 99 and i lasted until

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.360
i stopped going in the summer of 2001

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.959
right before 9 11.

00:16:34.959 --> 00:16:36.560
it's not [ __ ] summer school how do

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.360
you just stop [ __ ] going

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.320
it was a dispute over financial aid they

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.759
wanted a piece of the five grand i

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:44.800
didn't have money for the book

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.040
so what's the point of [ __ ] going

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.720
yeah so they weren't going to give me my

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.480
financial aid for community college so i

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.839
was like all right i'm just not going in

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:52.560
protest

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.720
who the [ __ ] needs financial aid for

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.079
community college

00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:58.240
dude it was like 1200 a semester oh

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.920
would you would you buy

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.399
uh most boot camp i remember you did

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:03.120
something

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.400
well it reminded me of the dreamcast

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.400
you're you're bad with money yeah well

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.360
i've heard the horrible

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.280
only horrible gifts he just spent he's

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.559
bought a [ __ ] dreamcast

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:12.319
when he then went to vegas we know he's

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.839
bad well i don't know

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.280
well when you go to bootcamp camp you

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.799
get paid the entire time you're in there

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:17.760
you don't make a lot

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.360
but i think you make something like like

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.520
400 bucks a week because we're all like

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.280
privates or private first class so

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.199
we're getting like 400 a week they make

00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:26.720
you like pay for uniforms and [ __ ] so

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.000
that's deductive but when you get out of

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.799
boot camp

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:30.960
they just give you money direct deposit

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.320
so i had dude

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.320
i probably had like a thousand bucks and

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.160
we had 10 days leave

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.160
and on the night before i had to go down

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.919
to camp lejeune i treated the whole

00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:40.480
squad

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.400
to olympics getting kid rock tickets oh

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.120
my god

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.480
and i don't know if you've ever treated

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.160
your whole squad to kid rock

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.760
but when bob with the box kicks in

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.080
dude you're leaning up against the floor

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.840
like andy dufresne on the [ __ ] roof

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.240
watching your boys drink beers

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.840

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.480
we were sitting here

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.760

um i also suffered from severe anxiety

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.640

and everybody it seemed like they

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:31.120
stopped their conversation just to look

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.200
at me getting dropped off by my dad

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.559
so i felt like everybody was talking

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:35.919
about me so i was just crushed by

00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:37.360
anxiety heading in

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.799

how are johnson's by the airport i don't

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:46.960

after a couple of 7 47 i don't even

00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:03.119
notice it i think honestly

00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:04.720
subconsciously i might have chosen it

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.040
because you know as a kid one of my

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.640
uh one of my worst memories was of

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.240
hearing my parents have sex all the time

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:10.960
jesus

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.240
so it's like the more that i i guess

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.160
maybe subconsciously i chose to live

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.520
near the airport yeah get that jet

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:15.920

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.240
[ __ ] numb your brain dude and i

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.440
actually i actually heard a whisper

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.319
argument

00:43:22.319 --> 00:43:24.640
with my between my mom and dad my dad

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.079

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.760
she was not having it and i gave him a

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.119
lot of credit for maintaining the

00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:32.880
whisper the entire time

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.200

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.599
by and large like my parents have a good

00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:04.800
relationship although there was one

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.880
moment

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.400
there was one moment where my dad

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.680
actually threatened my mom with a knife

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.839
at the dinner table

00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:13.760
butter or steak it was a steak night

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.440

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.640
night

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.079
that's the thing it was a one-and-done

00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:25.119
deal so damn can you witness this

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:26.880
yeah he he i don't know i forget what

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.160

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.359
then he dropped it now i'm getting ahead

00:44:31.359 --> 00:44:33.119
tonight

00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:35.040

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.400

a thing that occurred on a regular basis

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:40.960
so i'm inclined to think it was

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.079
something my mom said

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:45.040

but the last time i peed in the bottom

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:37.760
my wife was driving me to one of my

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.119
favorite murder sites

00:58:39.119 --> 00:58:40.720
which is the sharon tate house in los

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.640
angeles

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.960

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:46.319
picking a family

the maine

00:58:56.319 --> 00:58:57.680
yeah that actually makes sense too

00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.200
because i remember you always going to

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.160
la and being like

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.000

disneyland like a [ __ ] normal person

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.200

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.720
the guy that ended up buying sharon

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.720
tate's old house he demolished the house

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.319
and he put up this monstrosity but it's

00:59:14.319 --> 00:59:17.839
the executive producer of full house

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:19.450

00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:23.720
[Laughter]

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.960

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.640
the family matters house and kill that

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:26.960

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.799

00:59:38.079 --> 00:59:41.200
think you'd be like did i do that

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.079
but omaha steaks we got them one time

00:59:44.079 --> 00:59:45.440
they came door to door

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.280
