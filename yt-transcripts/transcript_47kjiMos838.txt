parents knowing that they raised you

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.760

d well not that they're good they're

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.120

but they like had uh

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.440
you know they played at notre dame

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.560

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.399
parents that's how they recruit you oh

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:54.240

high school she just signed a letter to

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.640
go play d2 field hockey oh nice so but

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.600
we're going through all this thing we're

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.480
looking at all these schools we're

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.920
visiting schools

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.200
at some point you didn't realize what

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.480
you were getting into

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.640
uh well that's also the thing that uh

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.240
they actually just got in trouble for it

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.320
on a recruiting trip

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.720
for some violations oh some strippers on

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.800
a bus or something i mean the official

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.399
visits to all these schools are very

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:23.040
very yeah yeah so even army i was like

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.200

having fun right now this is way

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:28.240
different than how they treat the field

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.399
hockey players

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:31.839
football and field hockey completely

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:34.399
different i guess

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.640
i'm surprised because you also told the

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.160
story where you know you went to penn

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.760
state and you you know got into fights

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.880
you get drunk

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.880
but i mean penn state's a party school

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.399
yeah i mean people get hammered they

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:46.399
have a good time it's a fun place

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:48.000
it's a good school too

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.480
but um i'm surprised you didn't go there

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.120
ah well i wasn't good no strippers

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.959
i wasn't good enough for football

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:56.240
and uh

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.079
yeah was that it

00:10:58.079 --> 00:10:59.760
for what for penn state yeah also i

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.920
hated penn state

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.279
because i'm catholic like i i was a

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.920
notre dame guy oh okay catholic

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.920
where i'm from like in central pa like

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.160
that it's very penn state or notre dame

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.360
and that's really it and that you can

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.480
tell who's the protestant who's the

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.839
catholic yeah although i would think

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:15.519
it's cheaper to go to penn state than

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:18.000
notre dame yeah for sure but penn state

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.920
and catholics

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.399

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:24.160
we all agreed there everyone agreed

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.200
there we didn't like each other

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.279

00:14:57.199 --> 00:14:58.880
um

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.880
it was funny because my agent the agency

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.800
that i had was

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.920
very

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.920
they were interconnected with snl like

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.720
they had a lot of people on snl's roster

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.839
and uh

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:11.360
right like one of my first days at this

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.480
agency they were like do you want to do

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.399
snl and i was like no

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:16.399
like i just don't

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:17.760
you know i don't think i'm gonna fit

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.680
there that doesn't work

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.920
and then she was like okay a few months

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.600
later she handed me a packet a writing

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.079
packet from snl which a writing packet

00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:27.839
is just like an audition basically you

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:29.839
write a bunch of sketches send it back

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:31.440
to them see if see if they would hire

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.360
you as a writer i didn't fill it out i

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.720
was just like i'm not going to work

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.560
there like this is a waste of time

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.040
didn't fill that out and then like a

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.800
month later they were like yeah they

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.880
just want you to come in and audition

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.959
i was like all right i'll do that

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:46.959
of course because that's audition there

00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:49.040
is just an audition on the main stage in

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.120
front of lorne michaels it's like yeah i

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.600
gotta do that so i did that and i was

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.959
the only one

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:56.720
of the people auditioning that really

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.720
didn't care because i was like i'm not

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.920
going to get this there's no way i'm

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.279
going to get this and then i went on

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:02.959
stage and had a really good set and i

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:04.560
was just like i might get this so you

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.560
just do stan your stand-up act i just

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.399
did five minutes i stand up yeah that's

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:09.920
all it was

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.759
and from that point forward

00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:13.040
they uh

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.360
they probably went internally said we

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.959
like this guy how many days from that

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:18.880
point to when you got a i guess yet at

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.279
this point you've got an agent yeah what

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:22.959
did you find out from your agent i guess

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:24.720
no no no i found out from them lorne

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.720
michaels called me why uh yeah it was

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.880
cool well so that was like the end of

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.839
august

00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:31.360
and then

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.320
um

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.199
that

00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:34.839
so it's the end of

00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:36.399
august show goes

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:37.680

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.639
september yeah 22nd when yeah 20th was

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:43.600
when it they cut it that close yeah and

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.279
also i didn't uh i didn't find out until

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:48.639
9 11.

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:50.320
that's when i found out september 11th

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.040
was when he called me wow yeah and uh i

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.040
should have told you something yeah true

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.279
true true but um

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.079
yeah

00:16:58.079 --> 00:16:59.440
well in between there there was a

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.120
callback where you just go in and meet

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.600
everybody like you go around cast

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.439
the writers you meet some of the cast

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:06.400
but you meet the writers and the

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.000
producers and all that to see if you

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.720
know if you fit and uh that's when i

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.839
started to realize like oh i'm

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.760
definitely i'm definitely getting it

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.919
like i'm definitely getting this job

00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:17.360
it's just a matter of am i going to be a

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.760
writer or cast which it's kind of rare

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.760
to go straight to cass

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.520
um which i did

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.000
wow and then

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.319
you know

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:30.559
it got very popular god looked down at

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:32.320
you and went

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.200
quit notre dame do you yeah oh sure me

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.720
huh

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.240
yeah yeah yeah so then i got crushed for

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.360
uh from that day until now yeah just

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.200
about every day it's

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.600
gotta suck because

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.120
for for a whole different bunch of

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.559
reasons but you do these podcasts and

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:54.559
it's oftentimes and i know that we've

00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:56.400
thought of this sometimes too you think

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.679
you're just in a room with your with

00:17:57.679 --> 00:17:58.640
your buddy

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.280
and you're just saying stuff that you'd

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.799
say in the room with your buddy and you

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:03.919
don't think sometimes that the

00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:05.919
microphones are on yeah yeah yeah and

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.480
even then i mean we had at the time that

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.000
that clip they took from me which by the

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.440
way it wasn't like that long ago they

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.840
took a clip from like 2018. yeah so like

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.280
people a lot of people try to defend me

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.799
by being like well we can we all got in

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:18.320
trouble for saying something back then

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.480
it's like now mine was pretty recent but

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.600
uh mine wasn't like uh

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.360
i'm not gonna go into that defend that

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.720
right now um

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.640
but our audience

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.240
was very small a pretty niche market

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.320
like it was like we we know these guys

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.120
we know they're not going to get

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.360
offended by anything we say we know

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.520
that's kind of what they want right now

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.160
um it's a small jaded audience no one's

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.600
listening no one's listening that's what

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.480
you think and it's like you know yeah

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.840
and you never think for one moment that

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.160
then some guy some comedy blogger or

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.520
whatever is going to find this stuff

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.520
post it and then try to make it a big

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.799
yeah for sure

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:56.480
for sure and that's what happened yeah

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.799
absolutely what's what i'm surprised at

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:01.440
because the value your value on the show

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.240
would have come out because i've

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.200
listened to you know we're listening to

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.640
some of your stand up and i'm like i

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.240
could see you on i don't want to make

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.919
this worse for you i could see you on

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:09.919
weekend update doing some of this stuff

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:10.799
and

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:12.240
it was the type of thing that they were

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.080
looking for they were looking for a

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.480
working-class kid to come in and do some

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.440
comedy so for saturday night live they

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.000
lost the value in that i'm surprised

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.160
that lorne michaels didn't turn around

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.160
and and and understand that in the

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.160
context it sounded like whatever

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.000
pressure maybe for him

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.400
for the show whatever the case network

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.520
yeah i think i think that's what

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.520
happened there was because you know i've

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.440
talked to him talk to him after the fact

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.520
i've you know i talked to him recently

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.120
uh he's

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.640
i stay in touch with him he's he was a

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.039
nice guy and he like he was trying to i

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:46.960
think he was trying to get me on you

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.919
know

00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:49.440
i think he was trying i think that's

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.880
interesting you got a lot of pressure

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.240
from a lot of people so it wasn't have

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.600
me on it wasn't his final decision uh i

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.120
i mean i guess in the end it was his

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.640
final decision

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.240
um but the pressure might have been too

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.600
high it had to be but yeah i think i

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.400
think the price was too too great

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.480
as far as like advertisers and stuff

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.840
like that yeah

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.840
and then other cast members maybe i

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.200
think some other cast members might have

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.360
a problem they got a lot of woke

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.000
very woke cast members yeah so and i

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.880
think that's what they were looking for

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.640
they're looking for some balance that's

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.120
a shame i mean yeah at the same time

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.480

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.320
