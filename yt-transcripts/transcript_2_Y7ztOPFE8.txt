00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.999
[Music]

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.620
the protests are going when they're out

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.059
late working at night token I think

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.500
that's a good thing don't want to get

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.940
very political on this and stuff like

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.399
that but it's it's not a black white

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.680
Mexican Puerto Rican type issue it's a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.300
good versus bad type issue and that's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.379
what I think we got to get into this

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.579
root of this thing they say well you

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.680
should have shot the killer shooter to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.199
to injure or just stack don't want to

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.520
get very political on this one with that

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.820
cop get out there versus big guy I mean

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.920
it was wrong with a big cop don't want

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.840
to get very political on this it doesn't

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.180
make sense to purposeful we're going got

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.619
to be better we gotta get rid of pain

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.360
you gotta eliminate the bed in this

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.619
world out for that that's a little rain

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.200
I don't get political political I just

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.220
think we just gotta eliminate the band

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.540
as well we gotta become better as a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.520
group but let's go in for a little shoot

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.340
to review

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.479
I don't want to get very political

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.140
versus pain

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.119
like I said people knocking political

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.560
it's not that's not making a race

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.479
[Music]

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.340

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.759
get together

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.380
and make this place a better place to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.720
live in don't want to get very political

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.520

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.759
of a weird energy

that's a weird Dominator

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.619

accident I told you the other day I went

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.360
into Wawa and like I always thought of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.160
myself as a pretty sexual entity in

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.800
general you really do the one thing

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.780
that's bizarre about you is that you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.340
will have interactions with women that

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.319
are just totally normal yeah just you're

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.640
just talking to another being and you're

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.860
like you'll turn you'll spin it into a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.020
sexual thing oh that's all that's how I

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.879
could buy I know I'm just saying it's

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.099

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.959
entity well anyway I thought I was a

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.700
section I wish I had an ounce of that

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.980

it's not a good or bad thing or a black

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.459

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.280
anyway we can pause I'm in Wawa it's the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.560

I've never had someone complain about it

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.319
but yeah it's kind of really the

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:33.120
difference is they're sick to say

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.099
something what it was just it'd be weird

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:37.080

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.039
pure misogynist yeah but I was talking I

00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:27.299
was like you know that's why I love the

00:28:27.299 --> 00:28:30.419
news yeah

00:28:32.659 --> 00:28:35.820
the one chick was like

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.640
there they go to such a [ __ ] realm

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.340
that just isn't real she's like if I

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.679
were to again an abortion I would have

00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:45.659
definitely needed this law not to exist

00:28:45.659 --> 00:28:48.179
back when I was younger

00:28:48.179 --> 00:28:50.580
okay that's your argument of why you

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.860
can't have an

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.000
abortionality of it is is that they

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.640
commit a murder yes and they live with

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.440
it and that's something that they are

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.640
comfortable with

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.159
they decide who lives or dies they're

00:29:02.159 --> 00:29:05.520
females did and it's like they asked for

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.919
the power they've been given the power

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:10.320
and what have they done with it

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.080
you know moth all babies yeah it's it's

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.539
insane so what's what's the Texas law it

00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:17.640
is murder after six weeks you can't get

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.620
an abortion aborting babies is a murder

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.020
yes that's what it is they immediately

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.240
jumped the rape which is almost like the

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.039
the copes yeah the societal coaches

00:31:40.039 --> 00:31:42.899
they cope individually and then they

00:31:42.899 --> 00:31:44.760
collectively cope and then we all cope

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.440

outside your house

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.539
like black lives matter facts that's a

00:32:36.539 --> 00:32:38.340

if you're sitting there counting

rude awakening we got to return to the

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.740
basics just and it only dudes can lead

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.079

been corrupted by you know the various

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.260
because you know that life begins a

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.480
conception yeah you know that true

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.520

life yeah you think you're on a path

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.320
that kid might be at some point that kid

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.640
might be they're probably not thinking

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.720
like that because they're putting mom

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.060

some [ __ ] going on it's like yeah five

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.220
o'clock in the morning here's the moral

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.720
of the story is we need to stop thinking

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.119
about when does Life Begin or like what

00:41:06.119 --> 00:41:07.920
are the rights for your body but you

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.240
need to just start enjoying cheese and

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.380
documenting our experience a little bit

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:14.880
of ketchup a little bit of ketchup it's

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.160
documenting the experience and just

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.540
putting out as much of that as possible

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.920
what about Big Time hot dogs

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.319
why didn't we get food tonight dad I

00:41:25.319 --> 00:41:26.400
thought there would be food I didn't

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.800
Spade said he was gonna eat I'm here I'm

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.420

your phone break what your phone breaks

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.780
I thought I thought there'd be this I

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.980
thought the podcasters should put a

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.460
spread out for them

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.579

convince people to kill themselves dude

00:42:19.319 --> 00:42:21.540
it happens true sometimes that's the

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.400
answer I mean maybe not that was just

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.579

accidental cream pies if there should be

00:59:48.839 --> 00:59:50.460
these laws true yeah obviously and it's

00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:52.140
also the best thing you can do you're

00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:53.940
young look there's nothing out there for

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:55.440
you man you're not you know I want to

become like a assistant manager of a

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.240
marketing firm it's like okay

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.619
cool

01:00:01.619 --> 01:00:03.299
so you know just

01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:06.140
as a kid it's better for you

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.520
I think I'm assistant manager of a

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.260
[ __ ] design firm it's like yeah

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:13.319
that's okay fine and then what

01:00:13.319 --> 01:00:15.240
then frantically try to get Knocked Up

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.799
in my 30s and use all kinds of science

01:00:16.799 --> 01:00:18.180
[ __ ] it's like just [ __ ] do it while

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.220
you're young and able that's true that's

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.559
what Leary was saying what his take was

01:00:22.559 --> 01:00:24.119
hot his take was like it should be like

01:00:24.119 --> 01:00:26.160
this is 19 we should be having kids yeah

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.319
his take was like you shouldn't have a

01:00:28.319 --> 01:00:29.700
grandparents anything

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.700
until you're 15. yeah anything like you

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.980
should be 100 having a good time all the

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.559
time I like that a lot like kids should

01:00:37.559 --> 01:00:38.819
be able to just be kids what about

01:00:38.819 --> 01:00:39.660
school

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.460
you just teach your kids okay like if

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.540
you eat your kids what they need to know

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.339
half the [ __ ] I know is not from school

01:00:44.339 --> 01:00:46.680
but then they naturally gravitate like

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.599
so let's say you have a village right or

01:00:48.599 --> 01:00:50.400
a town sure your kids will naturally

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.020
gravitate towards the carpenter or the

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:55.079
painter the you know mechanic like the

01:00:55.079 --> 01:00:56.700
kid will be like I'm into this dude when

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.380
I was eight I helped to do that painted

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.720
our house and he was like yo when he

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.940
gets older let me grab him yeah I was

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.160
eight yeah so but here's who is it who

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.000
would it know that's a classic

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.400
apprenticeship but here's his take so

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.140
those kids would naturally follow those

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:12.299
paths yeah and take on those skills

01:01:12.299 --> 01:01:15.480
right so then from 18

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:19.200
to 49 you work like a dog yeah you have

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.700
your families you raise stuff you take

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:23.220
care of [ __ ] and you vote yeah when you

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:26.460
turn 49 you don't vote anymore and

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:28.319
you're just

01:01:28.319 --> 01:01:30.420
an elder an elder spiritual help yeah

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.160
you're almost an elder what's that

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.720
you're all missing out I got nine years

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.119
till my other ship starts

01:01:36.119 --> 01:01:38.400
and then uh so what you're doing is the

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.339
18 to 49 year olds yeah are taking care

01:01:41.339 --> 01:01:43.200
of the kids the kids are taking care of

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.220
the kids too though because they're

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.540
helping out because they're you know

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:48.599
like the me me games yeah it's gone and

01:01:48.599 --> 01:01:50.220
then you're also taking care of the

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.280
elders but the elders

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.099
cough up all their dough at 49 they get

01:01:56.099 --> 01:01:58.200
rid of it they give it back to you or

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.299
they pump it back to like the 18 to 49

01:02:00.299 --> 01:02:02.160
year old crowd so businesses transfer

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.140
wealth transfers but then you've got to

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.180
take care of these guys yeah and all

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:09.299
they do is advise and meditate and pray

01:02:09.299 --> 01:02:11.160
meditate pray advise chill like they're

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.559
there you call them obviously why can't

01:02:13.559 --> 01:02:16.799
we do this up that would take care of

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:19.440
all the problems and honestly yeah they

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.579
would take care of everybody take care

01:02:20.579 --> 01:02:21.480
of a lot of them dude and then you can

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.160
still use all the [ __ ] we still have

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.260
our problems yeah but like yeah but the

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:27.380
only thing is you can't throttle

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.760
people in that age range with the

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.740
families they have skin in the game yeah

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.480
and that's the problem I think is what's

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.039
going on but the geezers can watch your

01:02:35.039 --> 01:02:36.599
kids too so like let's say you're like

01:02:36.599 --> 01:02:39.299
oh you know we're gonna go swim at the

01:02:39.299 --> 01:02:41.039
beach for the day the geezers have no

01:02:41.039 --> 01:02:42.119
problem watching your kids because

01:02:42.119 --> 01:02:43.680
they're not all whacked out there's too

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.059
many loud people with no skin in the

01:02:45.059 --> 01:02:46.319
game yeah that's true well that's the

01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:48.119
other thing too man it's like I don't

01:02:48.119 --> 01:02:49.440
think your brain's designed to continue

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.599
to think about yourself after like 30.

01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:55.160
probably not no and all

01:02:59.119 --> 01:03:02.039
and stop voting when you're 49.

01:03:02.039 --> 01:03:04.079
that'd be that's such a good idea

01:03:04.079 --> 01:03:05.700
how sick would it be if Greta Thornburg

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.520
