here's the thing i inspire my [ __ ]

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.479
fans to be better and this isn't the way

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.160
a human being should breathe after

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.759
moshing for

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.560
40 seconds this is good martian though i

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.320
really did give it my all and you had to

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.919
be totally in control because you didn't

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.360
want to hit any lights that is true i

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.479

right if she would have touched my candy

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.320
when i was a kid it would have been a

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.800
major [ __ ] problem and when we got

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.680

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.680
to show that's [ __ ] great yeah yeah

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.040
so how's it going over there good yeah

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.120

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.040
you know we don't cover politics or any

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.120
[ __ ] maniac [ __ ] that uh that draws

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.279
attention so it's just shane and i just

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:50.720
talking nonsense

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.240
yeah there's a uh we have a rule on the

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.959
show we don't mention the t word

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:57.519
which one trump daddy trends we don't

00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:59.360
talk about trans people than people yeah

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.480
yeah so

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.240
hell yeah no trump we don't talk about

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.440
trump we don't uh yeah we don't do we

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.199
don't we don't do anything

00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:07.039
yeah we try not to i feel like we're in

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:08.640
a culture where everyone feels like they

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.039
know and nobody knows anything

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:13.600
we're not we're not smart people in

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.439
general and we're less smart even though

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:17.600
we have all this information we're less

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.720
smart because we have all this

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.319
information i think before if you wanted

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:21.360
to know about something you had to

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.720
actively go out and pursue the

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.880
information read a book open a newspaper

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.319
yeah now it was so easy to pretend that

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.319
you know about [ __ ] and to

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.799
get accolades for your shitty opinions

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:33.039
that yeah i agree i'm glad so you guys

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:34.320
just do a funny show what's the premise

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.679
of the show so people

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.440
literally just us [ __ ] just you guys

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.520
[ __ ] yeah yeah yeah and uh yeah i

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.840
think it was important for us to not be

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.840
a [ __ ] right-wing show on that

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.000
network yeah but even being on the

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
network i still get i get people talking

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.160
[ __ ] yeah also like it's a it's a paid

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.160
service so the people that are

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.160
you're you're locked into that mentality

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.679
and people that are following that that

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:57.280
[ __ ] so yeah well i mean there's only so

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.960
much you can see look the reality is

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.960
like kumiya's the you know he's the

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.320
biggest

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.840
it's his network but it's you know

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.120
compound media it's anthony coomie

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.480
network essentially so he's the name on

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.160
the network and his fan base anybody

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.600
who's following it was actually called

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.320
that until something happened

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.080
but the the reality is

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.000
um you know you're gonna get the fan

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.840
base that is sort of geared toward that

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.760

back to gavin gavin has just he's gotten

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.520
himself into this [ __ ] i i was is it

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.640
a pickle i don't even know is it good or

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.559
bad i don't think he keeps his name out

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:26.000
there's definitely more people who know

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
who he is now i just feel like he's it's

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.919
her because you're you're

00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:31.520
he he's trolling the left and that's

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.400
what he's been doing the whole time

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.159
right he just trolls the left but it's

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:35.760
turned into a legitimate political

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.440
movement the proud boys have become like

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.520
a legitimate [ __ ] like you know

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.200
organized movement and no matter what

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.799
way you want to say they are willing to

00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:44.240
fight these antifa people and i've been

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.760
calling [ __ ] i've been calling [ __ ]

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.760
on these antifa people forever and

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.039
saying they're [ __ ] [ __ ] for

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:50.240
going out there and [ __ ] hitting

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.159
people with bike locks and showing up at

00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:53.919
uh you know encounter protesting the

00:23:53.919 --> 00:23:55.760
idea of a counter protest is infuriating

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.200
to me just you know like dude we have

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.640
freedom of speech let people protest and

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.679
you're gonna show up and tell them they

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:01.840
can't protest i feel like that's sort of

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.200
you're impeding on their right right so

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.799
i just um

00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:08.720
it's i feel like gavin's it's turned

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.400
into a thing where

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.159
it's kind of out of control and i think

00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:13.440
he's gonna end up getting in real

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.600
trouble because somebody's gonna do [ __ ]

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.120
and there's just video

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:17.919
were

00:24:17.919 --> 00:24:19.120
saying like oh i created this

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.279
organization and he's he's joking and

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:22.400
being provocative when he's saying you

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.000
got to use violence but then he's not

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.520
because then he's fighting people and

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.440
their guys are fighting people as well i

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.120
think if you're spending your time

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.200
punching people in the face for because

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.480
they don't believe with you politically

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.600
if you've ever done that you're a

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.960
[ __ ] piece of garbage period i don't

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.400
care what side you're on you're a

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.799
[ __ ] piece of garbage okay um you

00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:39.840
know it's

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.360
and also none of these people are tough

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.480
the people that are showing up at these

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.200
[ __ ] fights they're they're skinny or

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.400
they're either really skinny or really

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.240
fat on both sides they're wearing like

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.000
bike helmets and they're [ __ ]

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
nobody can fight if these if any of

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.840
these people went into the hood

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.159
any of them antifa people proud boys

00:24:56.159 --> 00:24:57.600
they would walk away with their [ __ ]

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.760
heads down because real hood people they

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.039
wouldn't show up with bricks they

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:02.799
wouldn't show up with [ __ ] uh you

00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:04.480
know mace or anything like that they

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.480
would show up with no shoes on no shirts

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.159
on and they would [ __ ] beat the 14

00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:10.480
year old kids for 13 year old kids would

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.200
[ __ ] wreck shop so it's just kind of

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.440

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.120

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.400

not wrong there nobody in the world

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.240

you're a [ __ ] racist even if you like

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.520
you literally go yeah all right that

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.279
makes sense you're going to ruin the the

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:36.640
the political agenda of what we're

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.799
trying to do if you do that um and then

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:40.480
he goes off and you know they they put

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.559
that together a whole n-word compilation

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:44.000
and he's also just got like cute little

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.320
clips of him saying like choke a [ __ ]

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.039
and then it goes back to the n-word

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:51.360
but once again i know gavin and me and

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.120
gavin have had our own [ __ ] issues

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.400
here and there and

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.600
you know i know what he does and he's

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.360
trying to be provocative what happened

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.600
with you in the prowl i saw one day you

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.440
were on twitter and you [ __ ] went off

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.600
about proud boys and and you tweeted

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.200
something what happened with you oh i

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.120
was uh at a bar watching the news and i

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.559
just saw gavin and proud boys on the

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:09.440
news

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.960
and uh

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.240
it was right after a wedding and i was

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:12.930
wedding drunk

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.320
[Laughter]

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.320
and somebody literally said like oh you

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.760
do shows for people like that like they

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.679
thought like that legion of skanks and

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:22.720
and us we like cater to that crowd and i

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.799
was just like no and then my girlfriend

00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:26.320
i was with my girl and i was like hey

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.279
you wanna watch me piss a bunch of

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:28.720
people off on twitter

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.159
and that's what i did for an hour at a

00:27:30.159 --> 00:27:32.159
bar after a wedding oh yeah all right so

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:33.600
it wasn't even specifically anything i

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.640
thought maybe you go into an argument

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.240
with a proud boy or you met somebody

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.399
that nope just felt like clear just felt

00:27:38.399 --> 00:27:39.279
like

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:40.960
clearing the air cleared

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.039
getting rid of a few people yeah yeah i

00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:45.840
mean look i uh

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:48.159
i don't think that the proud boys are

00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:49.919
inherently racist i mean there's a lot

00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:51.760
of [ __ ] brown people that are a part

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.440
of you see a lot of black and hispanic

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.679
and asian dudes that are part of it

00:27:55.679 --> 00:27:58.320
um but once again you can't

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.080
if you're if you're

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.919
standing next to a person [ __ ] zig

00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:03.039
heiling

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:04.720
you have to separate yourself from that

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.320
i i there's just no other way about it

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.000
if i'm i don't

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.559
it becomes like a it takes away every

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:11.760
bit of the point that you're trying to

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.360
make that's really i just really feel

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.480
like that

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.679
um

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:17.039
you know if i remember one time i got

to love it it's like an old howard

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.599
certain episode if all the fans want to

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:32.960
sit on their speaker right now while i

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.160
describe this

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.079
i'll make you are you in are you

00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:38.800
inserted when you sometimes when i make

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.480
but what i do is i kiss the neck pretty

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.200
[ __ ] hard and i suck on it

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.720
and i picture this like you ever see a

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.640
video of lions [ __ ] and like they

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.359
hold on to the spread

00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:51.440
yeah kind of like that

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.119
but you get it to the line you get to

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:54.240
the point where

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.599
but you don't actually cause the hickey

00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:57.760
and that's the special thing

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.119
she's an experience that's the problem

00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:00.960
no she i told i gave her the green light

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.640
i was like [ __ ] do it hang on i want

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.440
everyone

00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:07.920
no we were [ __ ] up and

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.040
i thought it would be funny to have a

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:09.920
hickey

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.480
it's not it's not i regret it garbage

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.760
well you know what it is it's also not

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.599
is it a few days old because it's not

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:18.800
that two days dark

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.839
i feel like i'm attacking your your you

00:38:21.839 --> 00:38:23.680
know physical looks a lot that's okay

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.240
you look great thank you man

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.760
your neck looks like it should have

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.640
different rash marks on it so it's like

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.000
at a glance i didn't know it was a

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
hickey at first i was like okay that's

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
you know it's a rash that's [ __ ] he's

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.680
a skin you know like you know like i

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.359
have fat thighs and my

00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:41.200
my thighs rub together it's like your

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:45.200
neck folds rubbed together in the winter

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.840
[Laughter]

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.400
all right

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.760
get on that scale

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.520
no i really i have to get on that scale

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.720
it's gonna be here but i'm terrified to

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.560
get on the scale right now i went 238

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.079
pounds when i started uh training for

00:38:58.079 --> 00:39:00.480
the fight i got down to 202 202.4

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.920
i believe when i weighed in for the

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.880
fight

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.880
so i think i'll probably be back right

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.160
where i was before the fight you gained

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.320
25 pounds in how many weeks is that what

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.920
you think i think i probably i think i

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.599
probably put it all back on

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:13.520
but i probably weighed 10 more pounds

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.560
than i weighed

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.079
uh the day of the fight i probably

00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:18.480
weighed 212 213. what's your diet like

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:22.160
what do you do you drink a lot eat a lot

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.359
uh

00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:25.440
i i just i i'm uh i used to weigh over

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.760
300 pounds and i think that the way oh

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.640
yeah the way my metabolism works is

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.320
i can get fat very quick and i can lose

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.480

about something else she did

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.760
oh she said she wouldn't do any super

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.319
bowl commercials so because uh something

00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:34.400
with colin kaepernick

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.720

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.400
she just didn't get offered any super

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.160
bowl commercials she was also calling on

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.079
all the other white players to kneel

00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:45.760
along yeah she's like you know

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.119
i mean it it is fine but once again it

00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:50.560
is a case of

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.040
nobody [ __ ] cares amy schumer nobody

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.440
cares about you and your comedy uh uh

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.960
let me i'm putting that the wrong way

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.960
i'm saying trolls internet trolls don't

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.119
care male comedians don't give a [ __ ]

00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:03.760
like you can do what you do you know um

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.040
but it's a similar thing to hannah

just his face plastered and all these

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.920
stories and then it's just watching the

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.160
super bowl and it's him with a glass of

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.160
champagne

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.920

people you know

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.359
i'm a firm believer in

00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:23.200
football players

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.720
should

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.480
throw a [ __ ] ball around run it down

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.400
the field score touchdowns and [ __ ] it

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.920
and say they're going to disney world

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.680
that's what they do

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.640
i don't want a [ __ ] football player

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.720
to make political stances and

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.640

00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:49.359
finger on other people that just are

saying like hey i don't even want to

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.720

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.079
it's crazy but colin kaepernick i

00:43:54.079 --> 00:43:56.640

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.319
an american i it's like look dude yeah

00:43:58.319 --> 00:44:00.880

for that flag and died for that fight

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.920
it's like no people fought for your

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.200
right to [ __ ] have freedom of

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.599
expression much more so than a a

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:09.599
flag and which is just a piece of cloth

00:44:09.599 --> 00:44:12.000
okay they fought for your constitutional

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.359
rights and your rights to you know be an

00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:14.640
american and being an american you get

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.560
to [ __ ] say [ __ ] you to whoever

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.480
that's a big part of this right not not

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.839
controlling our words not controlling

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:22.240
our thoughts huge part of of why i'm

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.920
proud to be an american

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.040
um

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:25.839
so

00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:27.760
schumer

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.520
it's just uh tony tony really did say

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.359
great tony hinchcliffe on twitter posted

00:44:31.359 --> 00:44:33.520
a tweet where he was just like you know

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.160
he she she pays publicists to get these

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.920
messages out and all of the major things

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.880
it's just it's her pandering at a very

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.560
very very high level

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.560
and that's sort of becoming her brand as

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.440
political activist amy schumer um and

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.119
that's fine as well but don't put your

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:50.640
finger at [ __ ] football players who

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.680
the [ __ ] wants a football player

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.760
to give their opinions on important

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.520
issues you ever talk to a football

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.359
player

00:44:59.359 --> 00:45:02.800
come on yeah midnight

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.160
that's what i want out of football

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.400
players just [ __ ] uncage them

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.920
what are we doing these are people that

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.680
don't really need to use their brains

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.599
because they're athletically gifted and

00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:12.880
i'm not saying that there's no smart

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.040
football players but i promise you the

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.040
average iq of a football player is much

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.960
less than that of the average american

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.440
guaranteed guaranteed no guaranteed no

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.599
way in the nfl nfl

00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:25.119
average iq what's the average ranking in

00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:26.480
the nfl let's see if they have it i bet

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.520
somebody's

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.520
talked about this before first year or

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.280
how many years into playing that's true

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.000
average doesn't matter

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.560
i don't give a [ __ ] i bet you're wrong

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.680
average american shut up hickey neck

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.640
that was a high iq [ __ ] comeback

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.150
yeah

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:46.319
[Laughter]

00:45:46.319 --> 00:45:48.400
i've never claimed to be smart i've

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.200
never claimed to be

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.640
even keeled

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.920
i swear this

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.480
yeah go ahead

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.480
so shannon does have the average iq

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.480
some guys that have failed it so

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.400
miserably that yeah damn marino's like a

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.319
famous clearly right here like 14 he's

00:46:18.319 --> 00:46:19.760
got scored like a

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.040
um there was well [ __ ] vince young

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.359
lowest yeah there was a there was a dude

00:46:25.359 --> 00:46:28.079
from lsu who played corner claiborne i

00:46:28.079 --> 00:46:30.160
think i could be wrong but he he got

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.119
such a low score that he was [ __ ]

00:46:33.119 --> 00:46:34.319
that they were like

00:46:34.319 --> 00:46:36.319
it's crazy that he was at louisiana

00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:37.680
state because

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.760
he can't read the quarterbacks are the

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.920
stupidest it says the the highest score

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.839
you can get is 50

00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:45.520
for this test okay so what is the

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.760
average score so right in the middle

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.119
so what is the average score for this

00:46:49.119 --> 00:46:50.640
test though just in general is it or

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.319
they adjusted this for nfl players he's

00:46:52.319 --> 00:46:54.480
saying 21 tyrant carrington saying 21 is

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.319
the average score 21 is the average

00:46:56.319 --> 00:46:57.359
score

00:46:57.359 --> 00:46:58.560
i don't believe it

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.880
i don't like the fact that shane's right

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.960
that equates to a little over a hundred

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.520
uh iq points a 21 score in the wonderlic

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.680
test what's a good what's your a good

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.720
iq 100 is average

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.560
i bet you my iq is [ __ ] through 120

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.240
to 140s

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.920

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.560
[ __ ] roof i agree with you thank you

gave up

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.480

no but you know it wasn't a good bit

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.599

00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:35.520
translate it didn't translate well no

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.960

he was like nah dude he was sober yeah i

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.440
was like what's the best guy

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.960
one of the best judges of character that

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.400
i know

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.400
well the first time we met was outside

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.839
of the creek and you were like i heard

00:51:45.839 --> 00:51:47.520
you on skanks great episode i was like

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.520
alright nice we're [ __ ] we can talk

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.520
did you know who he was when he came up

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.200
to you yes

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.599
you were just so zacchaeus like so

00:51:55.599 --> 00:51:56.640
here's what it is i know what it is

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.079
already because people say this about

00:51:58.079 --> 00:51:59.520
robbie the fire bernstein because

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.640
everyone thinks robbie the fireburn

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.119
seems a psycho um but he robbie

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:05.280
bernstein has like all you know

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.520
i would say almost autistic [ __ ] like

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.200
just he's definitely on the spectrum

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.640
zach's on the spectrum and when he's in

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:12.720
public situations

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.359
zach starts to get quiet gets quiet and

00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:17.359
inside of himself today he came in and i

00:52:17.359 --> 00:52:19.680
was like what's wrong it was nothing

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.440
and it was like just about you know so i

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.040
think what it was just it happened to be

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.800
a perfect storm of zach

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.160
drinking a little bit being a little bit

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.480
high being in an environment was that

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.760
the night you were getting on stage

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.720
doing

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.160
uh being a part of that wrestling event

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.839
no it was another thing another thing so

00:52:33.839 --> 00:52:35.760
there was probably a bunch of different

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.440
um

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.599
factors there but zach's you know he's a

00:52:39.599 --> 00:52:41.359
[ __ ] weirdo you can't yeah i'm hard

00:52:41.359 --> 00:52:43.680
to pin down sometimes yeah he's 340

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.640
pounds you can't pin him down it's

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.559
impossible you need three people

00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:47.680
yeah

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.520
i was drunk too so i was coming in with

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:51.520
pretty hard like hey what's up man

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.160
what's going on

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.480
and i had taken a 50 milligram uh

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.960
tootsie roll so that was not the energy

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.359
that i was putting back out

00:53:03.359 --> 00:53:04.319
yeah good

00:53:04.319 --> 00:53:06.319
yeah it's it's weird i'm actually

00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:08.640
weirdly awkward in social situations as

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.880
well like i'm not

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.880
when i'm in a new environment

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.440
i get very quiet i don't really i'm not

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.720

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.960

that's kind of the life of the party

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.520
maybe you're right

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.559

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.480
more devastating

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.359
because i remember being in

my mom's hand was like oh finger was

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.280
totally [ __ ] up and she didn't notice

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.640
it because obviously she was knocked out

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.160
and then she sits up and is like i think

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.680
my hand

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.000
i was like

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.880
john always pinky

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.319
she would cry if she knew i was telling

01:01:10.319 --> 01:01:12.559
this story but yeah good for her she had

01:01:12.559 --> 01:01:13.680
a good one she made it do you have any

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.359
making pictures of your mom

01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:17.359
i saw her naked recently wasn't that is

01:01:17.359 --> 01:01:20.640
she doing all right it was a disaster

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.720
but yeah you know what i learned which

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.880
was really disheartening was uh

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.559
well first off i found out this week my

01:01:26.559 --> 01:01:28.799
dad still comes yeah you told me that i

01:01:28.799 --> 01:01:30.400
didn't know dad she could come still

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.319
he's still jesus i guess

01:01:32.319 --> 01:01:34.000
according to everybody this is your dad

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.680
of course you should still come yeah no

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.000
now everyone's like my perspective on

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.760
parents are they're young like my dad

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.440
was murdered when he was 26 and my dad

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.760
my mom died when she was like 43 or 44.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.520
so i just imagine all parents as being

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.960
40.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.079
like when i think about my mom i'm

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:49.040
thinking

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.960
40 years old yeah yeah well that's what

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.920
they're going to look like when you get

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.839
to portugal

01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:56.640
what is puerto rico

01:01:57.359 --> 01:02:00.400
i think it's rvl

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.079
electricity

01:02:04.079 --> 01:02:05.680
my friend just saw my mom make it like

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.559
three years ago uh he cuts our lawn uh

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:11.039
on the gate

01:02:11.039 --> 01:02:12.480
one of those ride mowers and she was

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.640
just cleaning like dusting ass nude and

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.319
she's like 16. she did that on purpose

01:02:16.319 --> 01:02:18.640
68. don't you nobody i know i know they

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.079
got a full acre there's a check there's

01:02:20.079 --> 01:02:22.319
a check in the building uh

01:02:22.319 --> 01:02:23.760
on the back courtyard we can see one of

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.599
the buildings yeah her there's a window

01:02:25.599 --> 01:02:27.760
that goes directly into her shower

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.839
and she didn't put a curtain up she just

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.039
peeping tom it's not like we're [ __ ]

01:02:45.039 --> 01:02:46.640
going out with binoculars on a roof or

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.559
climbing a tree we're standing in a back

01:02:48.559 --> 01:02:49.599
courtyard and there happens to be a

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:52.000
woman who knows she's in the window

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.599
shannon stop making a face like that

01:02:53.599 --> 01:02:55.200
shannon this is not any sort of illegal

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.480
activity is it

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.200
shannon no

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.880
isn't peeping tom

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.280
illegal but i'm not peeping timing

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.799
i guess not then

01:03:04.799 --> 01:03:06.720
if we're if we're standing there in in

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.400
our eyesight

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.680
she happens to be sponging her body off

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.359
in a seductive way i think what she's

01:03:13.359 --> 01:03:15.119
doing is illegal yes she might actually

01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:16.799
be there if that was a dude just up

01:03:16.799 --> 01:03:18.319
there [ __ ] soaping his dick in the

01:03:18.319 --> 01:03:19.599
window every day people would be like

01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:21.039
all right legally that guy needs

01:03:21.039 --> 01:03:22.720
curtains i'd still watch it i would

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.319
definitely watch it dude [ __ ] there's

01:03:24.319 --> 01:03:26.240
something about nudity like in my mind

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.839
at any moment maybe a girl's gonna come

01:03:27.839 --> 01:03:30.480
in and be naked with like all right guys

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.559
there's nudity happening right now time

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:34.480
the [ __ ] out that's a real straight one

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.160
we're really watching this hopefully two

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.240
different endings

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.680
how did you see your mom naked hold on

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.440
peeping tom law generally makes it a

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.760
crime to view and or photograph or film

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.760
a person without his or her consent

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.720
peeping tom statutes differ differ from

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.079
state to state

01:03:50.079 --> 01:03:51.599
but they usually require that the victim

01:03:51.599 --> 01:03:53.119
did not realize he or she was being

01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:54.720
viewed that the victim was fully or

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.640
partially naked hold on so i'm repeating

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.319

01:03:58.319 --> 01:03:59.520

01:04:27.039 --> 01:04:28.799
adopted by new york and other states

01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:30.079
he's reading this from his own subpoena

01:04:30.079 --> 01:04:32.240
by the way

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.240
is that a peeping tom must be using a

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.799
camera video cam or some other device to

01:04:36.799 --> 01:04:39.440
record a visual image of the victim mere

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.680
looking doesn't suffice or violate new

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.440
york laws ah

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.039

no that would i would i would know

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.839
that's a crime that is obviously [ __ ]

01:04:49.839 --> 01:04:51.280
ridiculous but if i'm standing there

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.119
there's a woman naked in a window i'm

01:04:53.119 --> 01:04:55.200
not going to not look that's crazy that

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.200
is [ __ ] crazy i will stand on a

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.520
[ __ ] bible in a court of law and i

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.319
think they'll be considered

01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:02.160
disrespectful

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.440
you're in contempt of court you're not

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.960
allowed to stomp a bible i'll get

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.880
arrested for everything else

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.280
before

01:05:11.359 --> 01:05:13.359

harrington for coming to my defense and

01:05:15.039 --> 01:05:16.640
i believe that's also but is there other

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.920
states where that would be the law where

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.200
if a [ __ ] was in a window getting naked

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.280

think this stuck with me

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.280
my mom was more upset about it than i

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.079
was

01:07:24.079 --> 01:07:26.000
she walked out not that there was no [ __ ]

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.280
at this point

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.400
she walks out of the bathroom i'm

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.400
standing there i was like

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.480
that's how i reacted i wasn't like

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.520
i was just like oh [ __ ] mom like you

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.799

01:07:36.799 --> 01:07:38.240
here like she got real upset but i

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.839
remember the one thing that stuck with

01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:42.559
me is peripheral her jaw was wired shot

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.520
yeah still trying to suck in a noise she

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.119
she trimmed her

01:07:47.119 --> 01:07:49.920
pubes oh that means they're actually

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.799
this is what i was saying she's

01:07:50.799 --> 01:07:52.799
maintaining i remember being like i

01:07:52.799 --> 01:07:54.839
thought it was gonna be a [ __ ]

01:07:54.839 --> 01:07:57.440
chaotic it was nice but it wasn't that's

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.119
the shape of a heart yeah that's because

01:07:59.119 --> 01:08:01.119
your dad requests it i know but i

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.960
remember being like that was troubling

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.160
keep that at least that was the worst

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.319
part yeah they're active

01:08:06.319 --> 01:08:08.240
how much does she trim it did she just

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:11.200
like because what i do is i just use

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.799
head clippers yeah that's what i do and

01:08:12.799 --> 01:08:14.400
i shave it down to make it like a nice

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.839
short but

01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:18.080
there's no

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.080
i do one yeah so

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.600
if there's no shaping at all it's just

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.440
across the board just to [ __ ] you

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.880
know not a [ __ ] mess right right

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.640
you're under carriage so did she do

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.480
basically what a [ __ ] dude should be

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.159
doing at the very least under the balls

01:08:30.159 --> 01:08:32.480
in between i gotta be honest it was or

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.920
i'm saying did she trim it to the point

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:35.040
where she's shaving and you could

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.640

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.560
my mom was comfortable being naked

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.080
around us it wasn't like growing up like

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.279
she just didn't really care i remember

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.440
one time my mom suggested we do a game

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.839
of nude monopoly with the whole family

01:09:13.839 --> 01:09:16.000
and i was like no you [ __ ] crazy

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.080
heroin addict

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.359
it was nuts

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:21.199
damn dude that's a real [ __ ] my mom

01:09:21.199 --> 01:09:23.279
bought me my first porno magazine my mom

01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:25.199
was like weirdly

01:09:25.199 --> 01:09:26.080
like

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.080
just like i think because i think maybe

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.359
you know what it was did she want to

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:31.040
[ __ ] you i walked in on my mom with a

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.960
couple john's when i was a kid right

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.400
because my mom was a hooker

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.239
so i walked in on with her and i think

01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:37.600
whereas i sort of blocked it from my

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.799
memory because it was such a hurtful

01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:40.719
psychotic memory that like i only i only

01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:42.799
remember like later on in life but i

01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:44.880
think she didn't forget it so i think

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.040
maybe in her head she was pivoting and

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.799
going oh i'm just really sexual and free

01:09:48.799 --> 01:09:50.080
let me just pretend to be that and

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.600
pretend to be a hippie instead of a

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.480
heroin addicted [ __ ]

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.719

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.159
enough time to take my phone out and

01:11:26.159 --> 01:11:27.840
take a picture of my dad's gum jeans

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.840
look at his hand in his pocket

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.719
tucked in [ __ ]

01:11:32.719 --> 01:11:35.040
dude that is a [ __ ] crime

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.960
did he go to strip clubs and come in his

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.159
pants and that's what it is i have no

01:11:38.159 --> 01:11:40.000
idea that's just that's an old guy did

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.360
you ever ask him

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.520
i was i mean i am still curious about it

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.159
but he doesn't wash him that's just old

01:11:46.159 --> 01:11:48.400
wrangler [ __ ] for like 20 years yeah i

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.000
mean that's what i had to that's what i

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.679
surmised i think he's beaten off just

01:11:51.679 --> 01:11:52.880
putting the zipper down in like the

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.040
basement and then he just comes he

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.239
launches

01:11:56.239 --> 01:11:57.199
well maybe he's just like a little

01:11:57.199 --> 01:12:00.239
excess oh wow yeah wow i've been doing a

01:12:00.239 --> 01:12:01.199
lot of thought about this since i've

01:12:01.199 --> 01:12:02.960
seen it well how do you do that because

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.000
i don't

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.920
you never use your jeans to wipe up your

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:06.960
comb the only time i would imagine

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.159
coming your pants is if you're at a show

01:12:08.159 --> 01:12:09.199
and i've heard i've never had this

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:10.000
happen

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.920
but i've heard i've had friends

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.960
not only that i have friends who

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.880
literally say they get lap dances to

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.880
come like that's why they got which is

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.640
crazy i had a friend that used to keep

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.800
gym shorts in his car

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.800
and he would come in in his work suit

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.000
with just gym shorts on him

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.679
just letting everyone know he means

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.280
business dude

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.280
yeah i i just can't imagine that so the

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.840
idea of

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.880
coming um

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:38.640
on your pants like that that's just

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.000
[ __ ] i mean when i was i remember

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.600
when i was younger

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.320
i i would come on my robe

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.920

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.840

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.719
um

01:12:56.719 --> 01:12:58.320
so then

01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.840
i'm right buying like you know everyone

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.520

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.040
old face of buying

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.960
stars and black lights and stupid [ __ ]

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.800
for your room

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.719
i think every [ __ ] kid

01:13:08.719 --> 01:13:10.640
did that it was so cool in my mind yeah

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.159
so i got my clueless as a rope glowed

01:13:12.159 --> 01:13:14.560
like dr

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.120
yeah manhattan i got that black light i

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.960
turned it on i remember my [ __ ]

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.560
sister was in the room she didn't see it

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.159
i turned it on it was behind her and i

01:13:24.159 --> 01:13:26.560
just saw a [ __ ] it's just

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.320
like a [ __ ] painting just [ __ ]

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.320
christmas everywhere like mr burns on

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.400
ether yeah

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.600
and yeah then i turned it off and i was

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.199
like holy [ __ ] and that was i didn't i

01:13:35.199 --> 01:13:35.920
didn't

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.120
at that point i didn't even know you

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.440
could use blacklight to see jizz yeah

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.120
that was uh

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.040
for the internet second theory

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.960
i think your dad just jerks off and puts

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.280
his pants back on doesn't clean up

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.960
here was his actual defense and it's a

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.960
little more sad than him jerking off he

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.840
just had had prostate cancer oh pee

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.080
so fluids it was yeah i think that's

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.400
what he tried to say it was yeah to make

01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.920
us feel bad for making fun of him for

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.000
coming on himself

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.159
i think he was coming on himself

01:14:04.159 --> 01:14:05.280
but i didn't think you could i didn't

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.520
think he could come really

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.360
until i brought this up to tommy and he

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.840
was like what are you a [ __ ] idiot

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.600
yeah later on in life you can't still be

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.120
mad at me i am still mad i said this

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.400
whole all right you said tight ends were

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.840
offensive linemen

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.520
that's [ __ ] gayer than not knowing my

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.159
dad comes the second theory is because i

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.760
used to do this in like high school you

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.400
do a quick [ __ ] like a zipper with your

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.920
girl sitting on top of you there's no

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.199
way my parents are ripping off

01:14:31.199 --> 01:14:32.400
quickbooks

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.760
she's taking care of her

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.960
there's a chance now they hate each

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.159
other they were taking care of the

01:14:36.159 --> 01:14:38.480
garden she was taking care of her pubes

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.239
a while ago now they hate each other

01:14:40.239 --> 01:14:42.640
they're not ripping off quick [ __ ] okay

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.080
maybe this is trip joint though yeah but

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.840

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.040
guys

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.480

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.840
still you can still hate and [ __ ] you

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:50.960

anywhere from 20 to 40 an hour starting

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.640
out that's not much at all you could be

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.800
a garbage man and make more money

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.159

01:18:48.159 --> 01:18:49.840
lot of money when they say

you get [ __ ]

01:18:51.199 --> 01:18:53.120
because they're new to the game so like

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.120
the ones if you're like a new girl on a

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.040
website and you're putting in the hours

01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.120
a lot of them make five a minute but the

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.840
site takes i think 250

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.199
out of that

01:19:03.199 --> 01:19:05.520
but so like you you get a lot of money

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.040
at first but then

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.800

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:54.080
thinking that it'll ever happen right

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.440

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.199

somebody somebody broke down how big a

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.360

see him i'm gonna beat you up and then

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.920
he did

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.600
he just kept on running up to him and

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.800
just like beating him up and throwing

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.840
him into court

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.159

01:27:50.159 --> 01:27:52.000
yeah yeah yeah

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
so [ __ ] happens comedians get into

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.840
[ __ ] physical altercations and fights

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.600
yes i do have anger problems i know i do

01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.840
have anger problems and i am considering

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.679
getting into actual anger management

01:28:01.679 --> 01:28:03.760
because i i'm not trying to be a [ __ ]

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.360
angry dude i should be able to control

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.360
my temper a little bit more often but

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.800
the times that people have seen me be

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.719
kind of a crazy person

01:28:10.719 --> 01:28:12.400
um i think they've been justified or at

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.760
the very least some or

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.960
justifies the wrong word because i don't

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.159
think i don't think it's justified to

01:28:16.159 --> 01:28:17.920
threaten people with violence if people

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:18.960
are just using their words there's not

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.800
really justification for it but i'm

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.800
saying a rational human being can wrap

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:24.639
their mind around

01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:26.639
those scenarios if i can also add

01:28:26.639 --> 01:28:28.400
something to support you we're also in

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.840
an environment with very docile

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:32.320
comedians yes so you're aggressive for a

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.159
normal person but for comics you're

01:28:34.159 --> 01:28:36.320
[ __ ] wild yeah i'm i'm way more yeah

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.320
so you got to keep that in mind unless

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.159
you're yelling at the [ __ ] key foods

01:28:40.159 --> 01:28:41.760

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:03.199
street corner

01:31:03.199 --> 01:31:04.159
and

01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:05.600
yeah that's what happened so most people

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.440
only smoke weed on a street corner like

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.520

constantly walking around just smoking a

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.600
blunt hanging out of my mouth like it's

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.760
legal like there's not like

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.840
but then it's expectation though right i

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:25.120

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:27.600
i go in for a day to jail

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.679

01:31:29.679 --> 01:31:31.840
i'm going like all right 24 hours i

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:34.239

order to smoke that blunt right now you

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.199

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.280
at once

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:51.120

an idiot didn't even think about it

01:32:26.719 --> 01:32:27.520
right

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:29.920

i'm still in trouble

01:32:45.199 --> 01:32:47.440
so the cop luckily

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.520
was like uh

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.520

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:00.320
he just gave me the ticket for the

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.840
[ __ ] weed wow

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.440
um but i i mean i know this means you're

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:04.800
not allowed to say the n-word anymore

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.960
right i said it three times as soon as

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:08.560
he did it well you know

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:09.920
oh is that why he was like hell yeah

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:11.440

real i don't even know what the charge

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:37.280
is if you get caught with a hit of

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.040
exorcism

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:41.040
but it's a bigger charge than weed no it

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.440

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.880
it was like during the days of college

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.080

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.760
say they keep the lights on in the back

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:26.880
and then that you were in complete

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:29.360
darkness no so there's there's booths

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.679
like private okay so they have like you

01:40:31.679 --> 01:40:33.440
know store lights

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:35.840
for the merchandise so in the storefront

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.199
it's it's kind of dark because they

01:40:37.199 --> 01:40:38.560
don't want to show that they're open

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:39.920
it's [ __ ] two o'clock in the morning

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:41.840
so it's illegal so they keep the very

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.440
back lights on and then i had to walk

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.920
into a uh essentially a quiet booth that

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:48.719
was dark so so she grabs my dick and

01:40:48.719 --> 01:40:50.719
she's been over and i think she's i

01:40:50.719 --> 01:40:52.320
think i'm going in her [ __ ]

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.360
and

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.320
um so this is pre-op

01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:00.080
pre-op and uh i felt a

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:02.560
and then i bugged the [ __ ] out

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.920
