wops different perspectives yeah

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.190
are some different perspectives here

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.229
that's there's a penchant for violence

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.569
yeah I think so I mean yeah after a year

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:19.069
and a half of doing the show we talked

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:21.949
about the Denver mob that's not a place

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.889
you can bring the mob like here we have

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:36.259
a certain structure like this alright

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:45.610
just a little bit of time cowboys yeah

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.790

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.530
me and my folks but clearing this field

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.509
for over 100 years the first

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:07.270
olive-skinned [ __ ] shot outside

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.289

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:19.699
of some wops all right you guys made

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:32.509
your point this is the trash we're

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:33.770
talking about these are the violent

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.840
criminals they came over here they came

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.960
over here and just desecrated our great

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.909
country the land of the Native Americans

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:49.009
should still they lost it real favor to

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:52.669
me treaties signed and broken Shane

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:54.379
really is like he's got a lot of bad

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:56.029
ideas but he's charismatic and he sells

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:58.419
them one

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.300

these are dude where he could get you to

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.320
rob a bank yeah but then everyone would

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.180
flip on him when they realize that he

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.590
tricked em I got someone to rob a bank

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.030
it would be like that evil genius

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.310
documentary yeah wait it's like one I

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.110
just made one guy get his head blown off

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.090
what the [ __ ] was the point of this

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:26.140
whole thing yeah but you sent us the

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.820
documentary so let me just say so this

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.290
lady this Palestinian lady though who

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.260
snitched as they do she snitched on his

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.840
black woman and it looks like she had a

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.940
book deal with some publisher and they

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.370
they pulled it they took it away [ __ ]

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.110
because she snitched because she was

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.740
like look what they're doing in the book

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.730
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.640
complete this thought but it's funny

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.330
that like like the left has pushed so

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.520
hard to be like Palestinians are great

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.080
[ __ ] is they actually are like

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.120
anti-israel which is really crazy yeah

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.740
then there's a lot of money behind

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.570

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.520
acting boss when the Carmine Persico was

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.270

bunch of people that's what that's what

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.540
khatola said in documentary he was like

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.110
my dad my dad said here's what my dad

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.370
was there because sometimes you got to

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.860
hurt people hurt people I mean put him

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.430

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.480
I read Tomatoes sons book yeah called

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.130
sins my father and you know like the

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.630
murder machine in Brooklyn at the

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.560
[ __ ] bodies I think the oh yes and

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.350
loungy and I yeah that sounds right

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.730
there was something like that it was

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.040
just like this guy [ __ ]

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.750
drained bodies they called this one guy

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.790
Dracula because he would drain the

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.190
bodies then hack them up like you know

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:07.650
[Laughter]

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.890
[Laughter]

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:32.150
[Laughter]

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.399
[Music]

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:57.480
there are probably just because black

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.980
people like enjoying church just singing

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.839
and praising like you should be

00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:06.779
miserable that's why people died but

00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:09.569
they but when you Roy DeMeo Sons book

00:15:09.569 --> 00:15:12.360
you know like sons of gangsters always

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.250
do this thing where they're like yeah my

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.600
father was the sweetest man in the world

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.850
and one day he looked at me and said son

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.940
sometimes you have to hurt people but I

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.980
know he didn't like it yeah dude he's a

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.569
piece of [ __ ] he murdered a lot of

00:15:24.569 --> 00:15:26.970
people on a certain level he enjoyed it

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.500
yeah it's like this guy they're talking

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.180
about Wild Bill and in the documentary

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.819
he's like I knew my father hard people

00:15:32.819 --> 00:15:36.120
but I knew a different father well your

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.649
dad's the same guy he's a piece of [ __ ]

00:15:37.649 --> 00:15:39.660
yeah but you people in your family like

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.010
that or it's like you you kind of know

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:42.269
their piece of [ __ ] but they're like

00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:44.670
they're nice to you I don't have family

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.189
that's like that that's well no they are

00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:48.569
pieces of [ __ ] but they're not murdering

00:15:48.569 --> 00:15:52.769
people yeah my my grandma's a piece of

00:15:52.769 --> 00:15:54.209
[ __ ] but my brother wrote a Facebook

00:15:54.209 --> 00:15:55.500
post recently where he kind of threw her

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.209
under the bus and I was just like what

00:15:57.209 --> 00:16:00.680
do you what are you doing yeah you know

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.070
a little bit of loyalty on Facebook

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:09.020
goddamn matron how many Facebook Wars

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:13.760
were started in Italian families gasps

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.570
on fire

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:22.460
Italian Facebook must be when I was

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.510
dating my ex-girlfriend my my 92 year

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.780
old grandmother who's from Muskogee

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.790
Oklahoma if we were just sitting at the

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.710
Thanksgiving table G over Seder she goes

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:45.560
dan is seeing an Italian old racist way

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.480
to say yeah I was performing in st.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.770
Louis one time and I was talking this

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.210
guy and I was like do you like Italians

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.500
and he was like well my grandmother

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.810
always said usually when someone did

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.310
something bad in the paper there was a

00:16:55.310 --> 00:17:06.589
Val at the end of their name yeah man

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:07.220
old school

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.920
fifties racists you think it'd be

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.360
opposite you'd think they'd be more

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.160
subtle with racism now but in the 50s

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.780
they had I mean they were pretty blatant

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.100
with a lot of it but I'm saying like

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.449
that kind of stuff or they just kept it

00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:19.430
in the speech more practice

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.050
is there a vowel on their last name well

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.580
I mean think about the [ __ ] Midwest

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.920
that these guys grew up and was just

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.740
wops running wild too crazy shown all

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.750
those [ __ ] wops out there going nuts

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.660
shootin kills oh yeah yeah you know so

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.950
they probably had a reason to not like

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.530
him yeah but this documentary about Bill

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.810
catullo jr. that is how we got in the

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.180
middle class though is what the mob yeah

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.370
really I think so what about the hard

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.140
work and determination of honest men

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.220
[Music]

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.690
really changed the service industry you

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.110
know you really made it about the diner

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.250
look at the Greeks they just came in

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.690
there or treating their diet their

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.640
patrons like [ __ ] yeah ever gone to a

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.380
diner it's like the DMV of food

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.720
yeah is that one yeah right on the

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.220
street oh I don't even know what those

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.710
people are making hash browns french

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.780
fries I got eggs with french fries every

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.220
time they're Italians are kissing you on

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.260
both of your cheeks you're asking if you

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.260
need more

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.470
it's the opposite of Greek dinars Greeks

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.030
are discussing Greeks though they do

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.679
make like pretty much every kind of food

00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:20.820
at their diners though you got to

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.210
respect that

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.220
he's up to something Franky good boy you

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.710
sure he's fine Frank yeah yeah you man

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.660
what calling your dad's peoples wops

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:44.160
so you disrespect them well anyway so in

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.070
June in June 1988 bill jr. graduates

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:51.210
from Community College he said my

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.160
father's so proud I never saw that side

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.990
of him before so that's like a big deal

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.850
when when you're a criminal and your kid

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.250
first one to graduate college yeah you

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.350
did say that in the in the documentaries

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.730
like I graduated college it was great I

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:14.130
don't know was in Community College on

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.049
campus do you even get a bachelor's

00:19:16.049 --> 00:19:21.260
degree no you don't associate associate

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.429
he made it sound like you graduate from

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:26.070
I don't from Dartmouth he's like then I

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.020
graduated college which was a big deal

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.850
in my family so I immediately with the

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:33.299
street crime ideally returned to exactly

00:19:33.299 --> 00:19:34.919
the garbage I came from I basically

00:19:34.919 --> 00:19:36.750
pissed away two years of learning the

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.700
streets which I would have learned some

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.799
code of conduct would inevitably stop me

00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:44.100
from doing what I did yeah yeah yes so

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.540
his father was like what do you want to

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.059
do and then he was like I wanna do what

00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:50.850
you did dad I wanna so he starts uh he

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.290
starts working for the Colombo family

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.140
what was he was just a soldier I think

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.549
he was just yelling a low-level one of

00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:58.590
those kids that like he just decides he

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.090
wants to be in and because his dad's a

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.799
vicious murderer they're like hey just

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:03.480
induct him in where there's a guy that

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.799
grew up on the streets that had no

00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:06.330
connection that worked his ass off a

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.070
good earner yeah it's like a dad's

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.770
baseball team head coach it's just

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.840
complete [ __ ] nepotism I think so

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.100
that's what's wrong with the mob it's

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.929
all meant ISM yeah you have these [ __ ]

00:20:15.929 --> 00:20:18.240
kids yeah they come in and what happens

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.799
when you bring a [ __ ] kid into the mob

00:20:19.799 --> 00:20:25.980
right [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] these rich

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.350
[ __ ] kids can't handle it yeah cuz

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.309
they can't because they're raised in

00:20:29.309 --> 00:20:31.049
nice houses with columns outside cuz

00:20:31.049 --> 00:20:32.580
your people love columns in the front of

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.200
their abilities of column well well how

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.260
do you get the house to be held up

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.400
structurally listen I come from cabin

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.470
culture we're all wood plants like it

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.330
logs there's an episode of shark tank

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.950
one time when Barbara Corcoran refused

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.360
to invest in these kids because their

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.250
dad found a Gamestop and she was like I

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.159
don't invest in with rich kids really

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:51.659
yeah so there's other there's probably

00:20:51.659 --> 00:20:52.950
other guys are there like just yeah

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.320
working their asses off hustling child

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.940
pornography or whatever it is yeah

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.320
there's on another Tron's a vending

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:10.010
machine yeah side missions on warriors

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:19.350
explodes like sonic [ __ ] coins those

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.679
nickels

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.900
yeah I roll up the body and then roll up

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.390
the coin mechanism is probably outside

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.070
of murder the biggest problem with the

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.040
mob mmm nepotism just soils the product

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.080
you have yeah yeah there's never because

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.610
we did an episode on Phil Suns there's

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.240
never like a son who does as well as his

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.549
dad Oh cuz it's almost like you you get

00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:44.200
to that point you're self-made and then

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.420
you give your family a good life and

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.309
they kind of they don't appreciate it

00:21:48.309 --> 00:21:49.690
they don't well he also doesn't know

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.380
like whenever you hear stories of like

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.030
successful mobsters there's always that

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.140
story of their childhood where they're

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.820
like we need one piece of bread for six

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.100
kids I'd sleep on my brother because he

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:05.620
was warmer than the floor Oh Lord taking

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:25.720
the guy's life so you murdered yeah and

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.750
you have to do is put

seat of a car yeah isn't that kind of

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.039
the point of doing this and so your kids

00:25:10.039 --> 00:25:15.110

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:20.650

have a discovery in heaven shall bill

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:47.380
and his son crying bill he likes to call

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.950
the cops yeah instead of a murder you

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.780
guys should Justin Cecily boss busts

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.910
balls like the Irish yeah that's right

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:55.870
that's how they get in front of

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.550
themselves they just bust each other

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.810
their balls so much that they're like

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.650
any wanna do this [ __ ] this sucks

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:05.410
right but I mean you have vast knowledge

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.620
of the mob well a little bit now you

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.200
know you know you get your good is it

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.770
always the kids that [ __ ] it up um yeah

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.570
I think so I mean John Gotti's dad was a

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.820
day laborer who like he'd like resented

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.800
him for being poor and yeah I don't John

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.080
Gotti did not get up John Gotti you know

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.850
he didn't [ __ ] up the whole mob he just

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:25.540
get hot

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:30.550
yeah and his son his son yeah [ __ ] off

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.690
he didn't [ __ ] it up damage to the name

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.400
maybe a little bit it was it not because

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.440
he saw that John Gotti had to take the

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.800
[ __ ] charges right I think so yeah I

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.480
can't think of anything where's a son

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:52.600
who like did better than the priors kids

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.870
do stand up yeah

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.250
would I be a lights out bartender

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.970
probably would my kid be a good stand up

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.340
definitely not not yeah not unless I

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.550
blow my brains out of a good book she

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.380

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.090
while yeah that's awesome yeah get out

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.580
cuz it got to real somebody like skipped

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.080
on a couple thousand dollars and he was

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.270
like I got either break hack this guy or

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.190
quit that's when you call an Italian

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:20.440
that's what you get ya gonna call good

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.660
wha he was just down at this like Elks

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.970
Club doing it for flaunted

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:29.840
[Laughter]

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.650
bread was too thin on eleven-year-old

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:55.110
Italian kid tab this guy someone sit on

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:58.550
his chest typewriters you gonna pay

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.020
anyway so the Colombo Wars are happening

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.050
and so soca Tolo senior do you guys know

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.870
about Greg Scarpa no he was so he was

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.430
one of carmine Persia goes top

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.770
lieutenants he was a guy who he they

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.900
called him the Grim Reaper I think this

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.920
is at the point in his life where he's

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:28.260
dying of AIDS yeah but he was sort of

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.700
playing both sides of this war Greg

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.230
Scarpa how he got AIDS

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.980
well you know you know he got he

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.540
insisted cuz he had to get a blood

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.010
transfusion and he insists that his

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.780
blood to come from one of his guys cuz

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.240
he was worried about getting more money

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:04.710
on blood that's how he told everyone you

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.140
got it well no we're sure he's Filipino

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:19.230
lover transfusion there's a significant

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.790
amount of AIDS victims that blamed it

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.010
all on transitions toilet seats and

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.280
hugging

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:34.560
[Laughter]

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:49.690
we tore my rectum someone sneeze into my

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.869
[ __ ]

00:29:55.199 --> 00:29:59.139
let's not talk about this it's crazy so

00:29:59.139 --> 00:30:00.969
anyway so khatola turns to kill Scarpa

00:30:00.969 --> 00:30:04.779
he fails so so eventually the war the

00:30:04.779 --> 00:30:07.229
war dies down the person goes are

00:30:07.229 --> 00:30:11.319
decided the winners and khatola is

00:30:11.319 --> 00:30:13.539
forgiven for siding with the wrong with

00:30:13.539 --> 00:30:17.379
the taking the wrong side then six years

00:30:17.379 --> 00:30:20.259
so they wait six years and then one day

00:30:20.259 --> 00:30:22.629
bill jr. him and his father they have a

00:30:22.629 --> 00:30:34.509
little routine every Wednesday Scarpa

00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:38.049
the other guy they sided with now he was

00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:38.679
on the other side

00:30:38.679 --> 00:30:42.549
okay so Scarpa was against the control

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:44.739
of khatola they sided with the cat holas

00:30:44.739 --> 00:30:49.440
because scrubbers got AIDS dude yeah

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.719
yeah that's fast-moving yeah I'm sorry

00:30:52.719 --> 00:30:53.829
with the other teams like that guys

00:30:53.829 --> 00:30:55.659
clearly got like [ __ ] one week yeah

00:30:55.659 --> 00:30:58.019
you're right

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:16.670
so Scarpa was going against who he was

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:18.530
going against the arena faction that the

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.750
khatola z-- were the khatola is were

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.670
backing arena cuz the rain it was more

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:24.290
of a business guy he was less violent

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:25.580
and they thought they would you know

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.530
they're trying to be decent and the boss

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:43.310
is in prison so you know grim reaper so

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.930
also this guy the grim reaper he was an

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:48.050
FBI informant for like 30 years and so

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:49.580
the whole time during this war there's

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.380
this FBI agent Linda Vecchio who's

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.660
giving him the names of like people on

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.610
the other side giving him names and

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.550
addresses every shipping him off to

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.140
everyone that sided it was a guy's a guy

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:16.130
it's a guy named Lin just type in Linda

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:17.480
cupcakes listen it's one of the greatest

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.360
games of all time so cheap so that she

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.750
he was just feeding Scarborough Harper

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:26.510
all the information so he could just

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.730
basically pick off everybody yeah he got

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.620
like really involved in the war and he

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.270
was like excited when he found out the

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:35.570
Scarpa was like winning it yeah yeah cuz

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:36.980
he was like oh no I got my guy

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.600
we got an FBI informant who's gonna be

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.850
running the Colombo crime family yeah we

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.050
could probably take out other families

00:32:42.050 --> 00:33:03.110
the Gambino's yeah the be tough to have

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.610
an Italian president with those with

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:08.810
those names no Mike yeah you're capping

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:12.770
them they're never get Sanjiv Ollie no

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:16.270
[ __ ] Giovanni president Giovanni

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:19.700
I want to say oh yeah we got one in your

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.980
[ __ ] face yeah you get you got one

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:42.800
dealt with them ladies lady [ __ ] you

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.190
think so

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.100
as my great as my great-great

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.870
grandmother used to say top of the

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:55.040
morning I could drink it

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.110
remember that de Paula beer is like my

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:00.370
nipples are darker than this guy yeah

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:04.130
yeah just have a great joke about Obama

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.940
looks like he has a burn victim lips and

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.530
then he didn't act like you couldn't do

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:13.730
that yeah so the Columbo ward dies down

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:16.000
so it's it's now it's six years later

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.919
they had they had told the persico's had

00:34:18.919 --> 00:34:21.530
told khatola that he was gonna be

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.060
forgiven for back in the wrong side so

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.800
they lied to him they're like God no

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.370
it's cool

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.129
yeah and held a grudge yeah so like no

00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:30.940
come on over it's cool it's totally cool

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.320
do you think in the course of six years

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.700
you would forget you would forget about

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:37.970
that stuff or you know yeah but as Mike

00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:39.440
done anything to you guys six years ago

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:50.810
no I'm thinking now watch my pocket

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:55.159
around 2013 I was just cleaned up I just

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:56.480
stopped drinking I don't know what I did

like gloating that he killed his dad

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.900
it's funny saying you got punched in the

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.730

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.870
Jackie de Ross on the street and he was

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:10.720
like he almost shot him but then he but

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.040
then he didn't I guess he got scared

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.680
then a couple later that night he went

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.530

outside his house saw him leave the

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.250
house and then I guess he saw a picture

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:24.250
of his wife and son in his debt on his

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:26.380

ruin my kid's life the light reflected

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:39.790
off my son's face I think he sounds

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:42.250
probably an even bigger yeah actually

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:43.930

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:53.260
[Laughter]

00:46:54.319 --> 00:47:03.480
by the way if you kill for three is nine

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:07.190
four gets cloudy he's tough

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:12.810
we'll get the fraction so yeah he just

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:15.240
doesn't do anything yeah and then he's

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.069
like he's like how can I get revenge he

00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:18.480
misses dad he's like how can I get

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.940
revenge and then a couple weeks later

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.300
some FBI guys approached him he's what

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:31.530

say they say don't you want to know what

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:08.750
happened to your dad and then he decides

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:10.370
his father's memories more important

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:13.130
