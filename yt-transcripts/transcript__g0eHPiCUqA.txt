the sand walked on hot embers the next

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.040
is you're gonna have to wrestle a low

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.090
level water or fish I will the ocean

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.930

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.700
I forgot how scary it is to just go out

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.799
I'm so afraid again attacks by something

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.000
didn't want it hold in you get pulled in

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.880
it would suck so far especially if like

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.340
just a small shitty shark bit me if I

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.049

really do look like a guy that lives in

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.580
Northern California studying [ __ ]

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.280
sharks off the Pacific and you are into

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.139
brackish water though I said I'm saying

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.600
dude I saw a shark this year in brackish

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.540
water dude I picked up a shark when dude

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.090
held a shark I found a baby shark on the

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.790
sand picked it up by its tail and then

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.040
helicoptered it out to sea just launched

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.380
that boy weight or discouraged trip not

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.790
on this trip but it happened to me in my

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.520
life you did that yeah I did do that

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.620
matter how big what kind of what kind of

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.000

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.720
like make a hammer now no sir it wasn't

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.240
you think it's a small yeah it's

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.210
probably a nurse it was small you know

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.190
you know the seas are talking right you

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.930

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.430
they might be coming for you and shark

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.820
might have grown up a helicopter she's a

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.620
daughter in Kill Bill do you remember

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.300
when Elway scored that touchdown with

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.789
the shark got up in the water and

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:36.510
pointed forward first down I actually

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.370
got lost and I was dying that guy said

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.030
move the chains now the only thing I've

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.560
seen down here at jellyfish it's

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.350
really--it on the beach or in the water

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.060
yeah they get washed up and in the water

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.220
that caused that was an early dismissal

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.200
for me in O'Conner we got out to sea and

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.270
then saw a jellyfish it was like I we're

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.270
going in so get a sting I have been

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.940
stung but not this trip thankfully but

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.810
anyway we're in the water no and in fact

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.820
people stopped to look at us when we're

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.710
in the water cuz it's very cold and

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:08.490
they're like what's wrong with those

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.639
guys a couple on a bike actually stopped

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.550
and was like where you guys from and

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.200
Beezer was still there smoking a

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.729
cigarette likes Jews on

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.380
Fillie yeah we were wondering who would

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.480
be swimming right now this is crazy the

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.550
thought that six is just dressed for a

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.660
city right now

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.150
did he wear at a beach the fact that

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.530
he's wearing shorts is crazy

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.860
but he's wearing shorts but you wear

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:46.010
sneakers and socks no matter what you

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.100
argue you are white trash if you [ __ ]

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.280
my cousin Frank and his wife went to the

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.380
Notre Dame Alabama game it was in Miami

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.240
for the championship so they went to the

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.180
beach and he was ready he was wearing a

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.400
[ __ ] like Purdue basketball jersey

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.790
gym shorts and sneakers sneakers with

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.760
socks makes it worse yeah having some

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.770
like Hanes ankle socks on the beach

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.600
bring that back let's bring a bunch of

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.870
white ankle socks I'm down yeah we're

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.100
built for it all three white guys like

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:35.570
us oh yeah like [ __ ] pants so that's

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.630
like that's his be too tired oh yeah no

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.250
hodo yeah he just wears shorts I'm like

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.400
a Flyers shirt hat oh he lost his shades

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.260
in the water which was pretty great that

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.850
is pretty great he's already happy about

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.610
that I don't know if it's a advantage or

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.560
disadvantage if [ __ ] went down if you're

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.600
in shoes on the beach cuz I feel like a

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.060
barefoot can grip the sand better well

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.310
we settled it they raced O'Connor was

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.650
barefoot that wasn't what the race was

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.360
about yeah took him to they took him to

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.950
a woodshed and the race bees who got

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:13.820
hurt okay oh no who do you think would

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.370
win what race me versus bees or no

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:22.700
Connor I think you get third I would

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.450
[ __ ] smoke them dude let me ask you

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.770
something in Shane I'll ask you to

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.540
follow question would you run barefoot

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.910
or socks and shoes there

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.680
and then Shane would six be faster with

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.669
socks

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.099
I mean without socks and shoes I think

00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:42.860
be I don't know yeah well the sand the

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.470
sand was uh it was very like hard and

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.900
flat like it wasn't like beach sand so

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.630
with shoes is an advantage in that

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.560
situation and these are was again it was

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.850
deceptive as soon as you started running

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.260
I was like oh [ __ ] yeah I forgot Beezer

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.710
condo used to be an athlete dude there's

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.150
nothing there's not a moment where you

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.920
pull a muscle faster than just a

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.440

and I'm like this is Kovac cycle this is

00:15:18.089 --> 00:15:19.769

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.170

Ladak Ovid versus the flu cuz that's the

00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:28.559
big thank you like all it's the [ __ ]

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:31.939
flu the flu kills more people and I

00:15:31.939 --> 00:15:34.290
haven't made the article was supposed to

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.029
dissuade me well I actually wasn't

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:37.769
dissuaded that ko vid was the same as

00:15:37.769 --> 00:15:39.029
the flu I didn't think it was the same

00:15:39.029 --> 00:15:40.860
and I read an article to like prove

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.509
myself right and just didn't have any

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:44.369
good proof they're just like yeah people

00:15:44.369 --> 00:15:46.319
die a lot faster but we're unsure of the

00:15:46.319 --> 00:15:49.619
actual rate I think it's them combined

00:15:49.619 --> 00:15:51.119
is like the thing that [ __ ] everything

00:15:51.119 --> 00:15:53.939
up yeah nobody nobody has like I feel

00:15:53.939 --> 00:15:56.160
like there's the the actual the science

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.199
just keeps changing every day like it

00:15:58.199 --> 00:16:00.199
affects this people it actually doesn't

00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:06.329
yeah I read that wrong I read that wrong

00:16:06.329 --> 00:16:09.059
those edited virus it really annoys me

00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:11.279
that even why would like why do they

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.929
even say that like they have to make a

00:16:12.929 --> 00:16:13.499
statement

00:16:13.499 --> 00:16:15.600
you have to like they have to be like no

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.699
it takes 14 weeks before you notice

00:16:17.699 --> 00:16:20.610
symptoms they're like hot chicks trying

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.990
to pretend they're interesting I

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:26.339
actually heard a die-hard literally

00:16:26.339 --> 00:16:34.139
kills babies I'm sorry no 2.2 million

00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:38.129
dead in America I mean they're saying

00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:40.199
but it's according to one model they ran

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:41.790
there like it could be there like

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.369
estimates from like several thousand to

00:16:44.369 --> 00:16:47.639
2.2 million that's like a mega model I

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:50.879
could actually just get online and make

00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:53.339
it get on like office Microsoft Office

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:55.740
making model that's like 88 million dead

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.189
Shane what if it's worse it becomes the

00:16:59.189 --> 00:17:03.929
McCusker publishing of the mckusker

00:17:03.929 --> 00:17:07.010
model be it would be so [ __ ] good

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.600
that's when everyone knew they were true

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.730
leader then because then people would

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.289
look into like other day like what else

00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:20.370
does he have in mind right dude I know

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.600
we've just been making fun of this guy

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.789
but I actually got some heart so he'd

00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:33.490
buy these I think bats cure it tears

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:38.080
mundaka you know what else helps a shot

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.460
of whiskey and then that's some hard

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.590
work I was part of he had that theory

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.990
too he was like he was he was actually

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.309
reassuring me he was like dude you just

00:17:45.309 --> 00:17:47.529
drank a bottle of rum last night you can

00:17:47.529 --> 00:17:51.100
be fine that virus that might you know

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.630
what if you use that against me that

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:53.919
might be the thing to pull me off the

00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:55.480
wagon if you're like if I felt like I

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.679
got the cove it and you're like you

00:17:56.679 --> 00:17:58.269
drink alcohol it'll clear it inside your

00:17:58.269 --> 00:18:02.799
esophagus I know there's nothing that

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:04.419
that would get you off the wagon so fast

00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:06.220
just having a rum and coke down on the

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.730

since quarantine started I've been more

00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:59.859
active than I've ever been

00:45:59.859 --> 00:46:01.670
because you're out there living that

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:04.510
beats going out walking having fun there

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.490
yeah normally I'm living normally the

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.359
life you're living is my actual life

00:46:10.359 --> 00:46:13.670
that's daily what just being quarantined

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:15.800
inside quarantine aside except at night

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.260
I go out and do stand-up that's it yeah

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.030
that sucked trying to get used to not

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:25.069
doing stand-up right now it's it feels

00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:27.859

00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:33.050
know what sucks is thinking like oh I'm

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:35.390
gonna have to do new material for sure

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:37.339
why didn't come back and it comes with

00:46:37.339 --> 00:46:39.140
the exact same material well it's gonna

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:40.609
be funny when you think you have all

00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:42.770

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:48.650
like just does like a take like that

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:50.660
yeah every single person's gonna have

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.390
code metier mean obviously it's like a

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:56.050
foreign team quarantine and Kovac [ __ ]

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:58.010

changed forever after this quarantine

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:01.130

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:02.270
going to loom over our heads for the

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:03.680
next couple of years and they're gonna

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.089
do a couple more lock downs I think

00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:06.770

00:48:43.799 --> 00:48:48.359
be off the charts it was a toy that's

00:48:48.359 --> 00:48:51.619
until it's goddamn grapefruit hop in

00:48:51.619 --> 00:48:53.819
perceptional be off but you only able to

00:48:53.819 --> 00:48:55.799
make things in the evening oh you know

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:56.519
what I was thinking

00:48:56.519 --> 00:48:57.749
and this is you know I don't know how

00:48:57.749 --> 00:48:59.309
great of a topic if you guys gonna be

00:48:59.309 --> 00:49:01.019
able go with this but we're sitting by a

00:49:01.019 --> 00:49:04.049
fire last night I know you soda you had

00:49:04.049 --> 00:49:06.390
gone camping recently Matt I'm sure I

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:08.279
have no doubt you've sat by many a fire

00:49:08.279 --> 00:49:11.519
but uh when someone's like eight yards

00:49:11.519 --> 00:49:13.440
away you literally can't see them yeah

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.450
and then I was thinking like cuz

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:17.099
O'Connor walked up from the beach and

00:49:17.099 --> 00:49:18.480
you didn't see him until he's just like

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.190
at the fire that's the only time you see

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.720
him I was thinking about how many times

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.730
people have been [ __ ] launched by

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:27.029
bears and how they only saw them at just

00:49:27.029 --> 00:49:30.150
the last second I would tell you like

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:31.829
you're just sitting there and you just

00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:35.519
see a nine hundred pound grizzly bear my

00:49:35.519 --> 00:49:38.970
question is how mad are bears when they

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:40.680
miss that opportunity is that dare

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:44.880
dropped pop fly what seemed well I know

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.829
they did isn't don't they typically stay

00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:48.359
away from fires and oh they're afraid of

00:49:48.359 --> 00:49:51.029
fire yeah but everyone's well they have

00:49:51.029 --> 00:49:53.369
to have launched people at a campsite

00:49:53.369 --> 00:49:55.859
that's what I'm saying if they know

00:49:55.859 --> 00:49:57.359
they're gonna take the shot that's like

00:49:57.359 --> 00:49:59.369
that's like a Miss dunk for a bear like

00:49:59.369 --> 00:50:03.950
I run I'm here how did you miss that

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:06.359
yeah he's not gonna see me until I'm on

00:50:06.359 --> 00:50:12.569
in him yeah I'm sure I think it was that

00:50:12.569 --> 00:50:14.489

00:50:14.489 --> 00:50:16.380
