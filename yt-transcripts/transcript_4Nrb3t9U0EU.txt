00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.119
that sounds good

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.079
so

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:32.880
i

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.280
i started this whole odyssey this very

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.840
dark odyssey i was talking to satanists

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.280
and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.119
they struck me as

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.640
they they didn't strike me as very

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.799
ethical people yeah i'm actually quite

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.079
anxious and um i felt like i had to wash

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.320
my hands you know after i hung out with

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.079
him yeah but anyway so and then i was

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.640
trolling the internet looking for

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.320
subject matter i mean when you're going

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.759
to write something and try to get as

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.439
much information as you can and then

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.799
distill it

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.960
and then i came across a cult called the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.920
finders that had been busted by the u.s

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.040
customs for trafficking children

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.160
they had six kids in tallahassee arizona

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.800
and some concerned citizens called

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.879
tallahassee police department and

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.400
tallahassee police department

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.800
arrested the two finders and put the six

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.040
kids in protective custody

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.120
and the two finders were

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.120
arraigned on multiple counts of child

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.040
abuse multiple accounts and they were

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.959
held at a hundred thousand dollar bond i

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.080
think it was might even been higher

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.599
and then

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.400
um and then two of the kids according to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.480
uh the tallahassee police report that i

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.840
got two of the kids have been sexually

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.280
abused

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.239
and then

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.800
the u.s customs report u.s customs got

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.879
involved with it because there was child

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.160
pornography

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.120
and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.959
they got a search warrant for the

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.400
warehouse where the finders lived and

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.239
they found child pornography the

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.159
warehouses in like dc right yes in

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.040
washington dc and they found all kinds

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.840
of really unsavory things

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.000
and and actually the fighters had been

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
connected to a murder too

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.440
and all of a sudden the cia came in

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.159
and

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.640
quashed the entire case

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.879
and those two finders were just let out

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.599
of jail and those kids were repatriated

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.440
with the cult and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.920
i thought to myself

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.840
i kind of thought i knew how the world

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.200
worked but after i read that document

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.360
it just blew my mind i mean what what

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.319
have i missed as far as my understanding

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.319
of the world what

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.040
how is this even possible that the cia

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.799
goes to bat for

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.959
some very strange people that are

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.560
treating children

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.280
nefariously i mean how how does that

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.000
happen so that started my odyssey that

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.640
was in 2002 and i've been on this

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.439
odyssey for the last 20 years wow so

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.799
what what did the editor say when you're

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.319
like i got some when you came back with

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.159
that

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.480
run in the middle he said you know nick

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.680
um

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.040
let's just try to stick with satan

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.680
how yeah what do you think when you like

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.280
how how many satanists have you talked

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.639
to and like what are they what are

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.079
what's their like life philosophy isn't

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.600
it just pretty much like selfishness or

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.320
like well i mean there's different types

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.000
of satanists if that's the case i might

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.120
be a satanist

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.000
i'm pretty selfish

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.280
there's different type of satanists um

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.080
and they run the gamut i

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.240
some of them it was very strange some of

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.440
the satanists that i talked to were

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.360
really really stupid and some of them

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.520
were really really smart yeah i didn't

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.240
find any satanists in between

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.080
but um

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.880
i was gonna go to uh one of the black

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.880
masses my here was my it was a simple

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.600
plan i'm gonna go to this black mass and

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.639
i'm going to write

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.080
an article about it

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.240
and

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.919
one of the

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.759
the high priest said i had to read this

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.320
book written by one of the

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.160
satanists of

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.320
the founder of that particular standing

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.199
sect

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.199
and

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.199
i read the book and i said well you know

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.520
i read the book and he said well you got

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.720
to do this and then i just you know he

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.120
was trying to lead me down this primrose

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.440
path to uh

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.720
to embracing bill zabob and i i realized

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.160
that they were they were actually

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.639
proselytizing to me yeah and it wasn't

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.240
really like a religion that i felt

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.160
attracted to sure did you have to like

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.039
eat

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.400
the point yeah like a come come you

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.840
should get you eat like yes well that

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.000
was one of the problems um would your

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.120
editor like come on

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.320
the host was the potentiated

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.280
administration and uh seaman of the high

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.759
priestess and then the priest on what

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:54.800
was the

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.199
like a flowery wafer

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.080
with the sameness everything is anti

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.840
like it's an anti-host

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.880
so um and it's an anti-black mass

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.759
whatever

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.319
but um well that was the deal if i read

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.479
the book i wouldn't have to take the

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.600
anti-host right and um oh really that

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.000
was like if you don't read the yeah

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.919
you read the book and you want to but

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.440
then i read the

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.800
i read the book okay so no you still

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.800
have to take the anti-host so oh what's

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.440
up

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.240
so i'm i'm really up to i'd like people

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.639
to live up to their word um that's

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.639
important to me and it was

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.840
it was kind of apparent to me that the

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.520
uh the the people in the darker

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.440
fraternity so didn't didn't cherish

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.280
truth the way that i did but you you

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.160
were at an

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.840
ashram right when you were younger i

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.319
lived in an ashram when i was 19 years

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.560
old how did you fall into that it's like

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.680
it's not is that like it's not

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.840
necessarily hindu but it's this was a

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.440
hindu this was a

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.080
a swami he was right he was from india

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.140
he was a genuine indian guru right

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.800
[Laughter]

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.120
when i was

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.000
in my teens i was really searching

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.840
um and i

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.240
tried all kinds of spiritual paths and

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.080
then i ended up living on this ashram

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.160
with a genuine indian guru he was a

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.199
swami which means he was celibate and so

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.919
i got there and i was just i was thirsty

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:19.199
for knowledge

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.680
and um

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.599
and i was talking to the swami one day

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:25.840
and i could have sworn i smelt

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.599
cigarettes on his breath

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:29.680
and you know i went to one of the people

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.240
on the ashram who i would later call pod

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.880
the pod people um i said you know you

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.319
know i could have swear i smelled

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.680
cigarettes on

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.479
swami's breath he goes yeah well see the

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:42.080
deal with that is

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.039
um he has to have one vice that keeps

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:46.879
him tethered to this plane of reality so

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:48.160
he can teach us

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.440
and um

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.520
now needless to say that didn't make a

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.759
lot of sense to me and then i found that

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:55.840
out that he was having sex with all

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.919
these girls on the ashram and then i

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:01.599
found out he was embezzling money for

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.680
his more affluent initiatives and i was

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.919
seeing myself that guy must be really

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:08.479
spiritually developed

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:11.039
if he's got to do all that just to stay

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:13.120
on this plane of reality i was like

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.280
that's why i had so long for so long

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.240
yeah

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.560
that was a bit of a swami yeah yeah that

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.000
was i always find that intriguing when

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.840
people end up on uh they seem like a

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.039
cool place to live it's just a place you

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:24.000
would go

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.680
rather than like a christian youth thing

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.360
it would just be like fairly certain

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.840
every single one of those is that i what

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.840
do you think i don't know if i've heard

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.279
of one story you'll be smart and all the

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.800
time i haven't heard of i've never heard

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.479
of one guru that wasn't definitely

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:38.800
banging a bunch of the people yes

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.959
that's what i concluded because i looked

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:43.200
into a lot of different gurus after that

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.880
and they all have lower chakra problems

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.959
every guru has lower shock

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:51.839
you know they're old ugly indian men and

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:54.800
then they yeah and then

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.760
and then they come here and they have

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.800
all these beautiful young american women

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.120
who are spiritually starved throwing

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.279
themselves and then

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:09.760
it's too much yeah how could they yeah

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.519
yeah it's like i found a book i found a

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:12.480
book in a

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.080
or like a used bookstore one time they

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.360
they write really good books though like

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.720
i read there was this is by a priest it

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.240
was like one of the best little books on

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.600
spirituality ever read and i'm like i

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.200
gotta google this guy pedophile i was

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.200
like [ __ ] damn it yeah well

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.360
listen i mean that's i've read it uh

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.760
rama's books and i was really fascinated

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.120
by them and

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.600
so i mean that's why i ended up at that

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.560
ashram

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.480
so what do you let's which one do what

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.240
do you want to get into first here

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.760
because i read the beginning of the

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.519
frank i read about half of the franklin

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.519
scandal like i said i was falling asleep

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:43.120
i would listen to i listen audiobooks at

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.640
night so i was listening to franklin's

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.680
candle at night and it was [ __ ] me up

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.440
like every night i was like jesus christ

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.959
and then i was sorry like i never went

00:09:50.959 --> 00:09:52.800
to sleep i would just start googling

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.720
things like the finders immediately i

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.320
started googling yeah and then i started

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.920
going into like pizzagate because it was

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.560
in dc and they were attracting this like

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.079
then i was like is pizzagate real like

00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:03.519
you know it's just every time i started

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:06.079
reading is pizzagate real

00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:08.240
i have no idea on that one i'm i'm

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.399
agnostic

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:13.200
with my philosophic training um i said

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.519
philosophy in college i try to approach

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.920
everything agnostically i i really try

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.160
not to make judgments on something even

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.959
though it may seem like a taught logical

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:26.000
truth i try to withhold judgment and

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.640
with pizzagate i'm agnostic yeah gotcha

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.160
but with the finders it was the same i

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.200
mean

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.959
i was listening to you talk about it but

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:34.000
it was the same thing where it's like

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.600
once you explain

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.079
like six children were found with two

00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:39.680
dudes in suits

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.600
yeah they're wearing like suits yeah the

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.000
children are all malnourished enough so

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.920
that just a regular person called the

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.760
cops when they saw them concerned

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.440
citizens and then they got

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.640
nothing

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.200
it was like yo this is very weird

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.480
and then yeah there's no way they were

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.600
like no we're just making sure they're

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.279
good we just like to dress nice and we

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.399
wouldn't have them

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:00.000
closed yet and the guys wouldn't talk

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.120
right when they were getting into the

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.120
card ready the card would be like and

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.720
one guy actually went unconscious

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.320
when the police started to grill him he

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.079
went into satanic trance

00:11:10.079 --> 00:11:13.200
he played satanic but uh yeah he just

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.959
went unconscious yeah it's a good

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:16.720
awakening it's in the us i might do that

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.399
to my wife just deadweight

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:20.880
she starts talking to you

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.480
you might have to you might have to hook

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.240
your wife up with the finders which i

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.600
know might be uh

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.680
i don't know if i'd advise that but you

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.760
never know that is crazy because you do

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.720
there's a lot of people i'm sure you

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.240
know this who are delighted in being

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.519
like that's all a bunch of bull they

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:35.680
don't want to hear any of it whatsoever

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.160
but that's like how much of it is like

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.440
like as you say like some of it's

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.200
conjecture some of it is like like how

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.720
much of the stuff you've done is like

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.240
ends in kind of like

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.000
like some nebulous weird stuff or like

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
what's like factual anyone could take

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.519
big this is

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:51.360
i mean the franklin scandal

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.079
i was very very cautious with it and

00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:56.079
very very careful i wanted to nail

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:59.680
everything because i knew what i was the

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.600
book that i was writing was so

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.079
antithetical to people's

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:06.639
mundane reality that it was going to be

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:08.639
met with

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:12.399
very very a lot of skepticism

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.880
so but what happened with me with the

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.360
franklin scandal is i was able to score

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.959
like there were three grand juries that

00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:21.120
covered it up um there were two grand

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.480
juries in uh nebraska and one grand jury

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.720
in washington dc now i don't know if

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.240
your viewers are familiar with the grand

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.480
jury but grand juries are infamous for

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.480
covering things up actually like there

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.480
was a grand jury in florida looking into

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.000
epstein that said that epstein hadn't

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.639
molested a single child what happens in

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:41.200
a grand jury is a special prosecutor is

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.920
chosen and then grand jurors are just

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.959
regular

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:47.519
people that have come in to do jury duty

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:48.720
and they've been funneled to a grand

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.360
jury and it's not adversarial the

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.360
special prosecutor

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.120
picks the evidence that is shown to the

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.519
grand jurors and calls the witnesses

00:12:57.519 --> 00:12:58.320
so

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.240
special prosecutors have a tremendous

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.639
amount of power over grand jurors and

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:04.880
actually there was a

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.399
new york judge

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:08.000
that had a famous crypt that grand

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.399
jurors have so much power or special

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:12.480
prosecutor special prosecutors have so

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.839
much power over grandeur is that they

00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:16.240
could get them to indict a ham sandwich

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.480
so with the franklin i've been studying

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.760
a few of those with the franklin scandal

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.639
that

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:26.000
those two grand juries in uh nebraska

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.959
said that

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:29.120
not a single child had been abused yeah

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.720
and i read the

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.720
the article you sent as far as like i

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.959
know this is gross detail but one of the

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:36.720
one of the reasons they were able to

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.920
discount

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.320
the children who said they were molested

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.440
by epstein was one of them said he used

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.440
a purple vibrator and another one said

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.680
he used a white vibrator

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.120
so they were like well these two are

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.279
lying what yeah i mean like he's just a

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:52.959
one vibe or something like that

00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:55.279
they only called one of the victims okay

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:57.360
one of the underage victims and it was

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.440
obvious that that was a cover-up job

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.800
yeah and

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.120
it's really a shame that most americans

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.120
because when you think of grand jury you

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.440
think the gods of jurisprudence have

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.839
spoken but that's not the case at all

00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:12.399
it's just a a special prosecutor that's

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:14.240
been chosen to show

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.880
grand jurors what he thinks is

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.120
compelling evidence yeah and that's

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.639
where a lot of cover-ups take place i

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:22.079
know where he's in grand juries and then

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:24.800
everything is sealed in a grandeur and

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.360
what happened with me is i was able to

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.519
get everything i was able to get the

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:31.680
sealed testimony and i was able to get

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.839
the sealed exhibits from one of the

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.920
corrupt grand juries in nebraska which

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.839
at that point

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:40.560
i i was able to write the book and like

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.279
i had a list of 60 victims

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:46.160
so it was up to me to

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.000
find the victims

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.560
and that was tough because

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.560
a lot of those kids

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.160
and you see with epstein too you see

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.279
with a lot of

00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:57.120
pedophile networks a lot of the kids

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.800
come from lower socioeconomic

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.800
backgrounds and

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.720
dysfunctional families and that makes

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.160
them ripe for uh predators

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
in this case with with the franklin

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.320
scandal lawrence king and also craig

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.880
spence and with epstein jeffrey epstein

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.639
and all the predators that were around

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:15.519
him

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:17.199
so

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:19.600
finding them was very very difficult

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.199
because

00:15:21.199 --> 00:15:22.880
a lot of them had just

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.160
dropped off

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.800
the you know the plan

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.000
just dropped off the planet because

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.320
these kids were

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.959
from really dysfunctional backgrounds

00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:37.279
poor backgrounds and they were given

00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:39.360
money and repeatedly molested and then

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.639
once they lost their youthful

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:42.480
marketability they were expunged by the

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.199
network and they went on to become

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:47.600
criminals to support they were all drug

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.440
addicts yeah or most of them were drug

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.040
addicts so they became criminals and

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.199
then they ended up in prison

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:56.399
so it was very difficult to find a lot a

00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:57.839
lot of them never really used their

00:15:57.839 --> 00:16:00.320
social security numbers so yeah

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.199
and i found them in projects i

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:04.959
i found one in a homeless shelter i

00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:07.120
found one in a prison i mean they were

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.480
they were difficult yeah they messed up

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.199
yeah

00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:11.040
what are they how like

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.560
are they like excited to talk to you are

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.000
they just kind of like who are you or

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.920
like how did you get to like

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.279
have them actually talk to you about

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:19.279
this stuff

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:21.199
well it's you've got to be patient and

00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:23.680
you've got to be compassionate i mean i

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.079
was very compassionate to all the

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:28.079
victims that i met

00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:31.120
because of what they've been through

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.480
and

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.560
it's a matter of

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.720
trust i mean you've got to build up

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.079
trust with them sometimes the trust

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:39.839
comes immediately and sometimes the

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:41.680
trust it takes a while to build up the

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.399
trust but you once you can once you

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:46.160
build trust with them they won't you

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.839
know tell you about the

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:49.680
the worst horrors

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.240
yeah of their life so let's let's get a

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.079
what let's what happened with the

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:55.680
franklin school yeah so with the

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.959
franklin scandal um it was a it was a

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:02.079
large interstate pedophile network

00:17:02.079 --> 00:17:04.720
that was um

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.120
that flew kids from coast to coast

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.799
but

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:10.480
a lot of the and i also got flight

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.480
receipts like to in flight receipts a

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.000
lot of the planes that they rented um or

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.640
chartered went to washington dc and in

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.760
washington dc there was a lobbyist power

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.760
broker named craig spence

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.280
and he

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.360
his house he was a ci asset and his

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.880
house was wired for audio visual

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.440
blackmail i get into his reality pretty

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.840
heavily in confessions of a dc madam and

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.679
i also get into it in the franklin

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:38.160
scandal but a little more in confessions

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.600
of a dc mountain

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.039
so guardian you have to does his mike

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:43.200
have to move up a little bit towards him

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.120
yeah just you can slide this thing down

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.400
let me see

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.080
wow wow

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.960
so

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.960
these pedophile parties would happen at

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.320
craig spence's

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.679
uh mansion

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:56.559
in the colorama section of washington dc

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:59.200
and it would be like a pretty much a

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.000
straight political party initially um

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.400
that would there would be

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.000
uh

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.799
washington d.c literati and glitterati

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:11.679
and power brokers and politicians

00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:13.039
they would attend

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:14.640
these parties but then

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.120
like maybe at 10 o'clock or something

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.720
someone would fire up a joint or

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.400
something sexually inappropriate would

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.799
happen and they'd and these people have

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:25.120
been plied with alcohol so

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.600
if someone wanted to stick around

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.679
for the after

00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:31.360
then they would be compromised so you

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.880
see like the level of grease a person

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.720
could handle the girls would come out

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.960
they would get me bust out of line i'd

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.799
be hammered doing

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:42.160
yeah they'd get me yeah

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.280
you don't want to say that

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.799
i only deal in truth

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:51.440
so it didn't get me dude so didn't it go

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.600
all the way back to the start of the

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.120
franklin scandal stuff it went back to

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.840
vietnam supposedly well

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.520
being in the two primary pimps uh

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.080
lawrence king and craig spence king

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.520
during vietnam

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.880
king was in um thailand with a security

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.960
clearance at top security clinics and

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.600
craig spence was in vietnam

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.679
as a reporter for abc

00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:17.280
so they were both in thailand at the

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.640
same time

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.280
i'm surmising that and this is just my

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.840
surmise i'm surmising that both of them

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.919
were molesting kids

00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:29.200
in southeast asia and then

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.679
ultimately the dark corner of

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:33.280
intelligence that does this type of

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.039
stuff got a hold of them and said you

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.880
know you can either do time or you can

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.679
work for us yeah because when both came

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.679
back to the united states of america i

00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:44.080
mean they were both from uh

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.600
working-class families and all of a

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.600
sudden their careers just went

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.039
exponentially

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:51.280
high so i'm i'm thinking that that was

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.720
probably the deal that they made while

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.960
they were in southeast asia yeah yeah

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.240
and it was it's the franklin scandal

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.600
because

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.679
larry king was in

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:02.480
omaha owned a uh well he was the general

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.720
manager of the franklin credit union

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.400
yeah and

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.440
he was it was like his personal atm

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.799
when

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:13.840
it's kind of interesting the feds

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.400
you're supposed to be uh audited every

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.000
year if you're

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.480
if you run a credit union but he hadn't

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.360
been audited in four years

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.480
so

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.720
shortly after george herbert walker bush

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.320
won the presidency

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.760
um

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.520
the franklin credit union was rated by

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.440
irs and fbi

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.960
and um

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.679
and there was 40 million dollars missing

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:41.039
so so but basically that credit union

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:43.520
was a cash machine for lawrence king but

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.240
it was also a front for this interstate

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.320
pedophile network that they that they

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.919
ran together and he was definitely

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:51.200
pimping

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.480
absolutely

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.320
both he and craig spence were pimping

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.440
and abc reporter yes craig spence was

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.159
the guy who ended in washington dc

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:02.960
oh [ __ ] so he was the one who was having

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.480
having the parties oh that was the guy

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.080
who was hosting yeah i mean the parties

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.760
were all over but

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.720
uh

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.880
but spencer's

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.960
the in intelligent like i said the dark

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.520
counter intelligence that does this type

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.840
of stuff had installed

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.840
the cameras um

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.840
the hidden cameras and ebstein now this

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.400
is kind of interesting maria farmer who

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.000
worked for epstein

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.840
said that epstein showed her the secret

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.200
room where

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.440
men as in plural were monitoring all

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.240
these uh monitors and that all the

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.400
bedrooms and all the bathrooms

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.080
had hidden cameras

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.039
so

00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:43.200
that setup was very much like the setup

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.799
in craig spence's house where both uh

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:48.320
places where why your fellow division

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.840
players yeah so craig spence was the

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.799
epstein of this particular yes yes oh my

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:54.400

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:08.720
mean i guess kind of yeah um i do not

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.159
know but uh nothing's a good

00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:14.559
that guy was a a pure psychopath so

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:16.400
nothing that he would do would surprise

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.720
me as a pedophile a psychopath a drug

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.720
addict um jesus

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.919
and

00:22:21.919 --> 00:22:25.440
he was i mean the cream

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.320
of the crop in washington dc politics

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.480
would go to his parties

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.400
and uh isn't that strange yeah isn't

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.080
that kind of weird the same thing with

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.200
uh

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.039
who was it when gates had to go to

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:38.880
epstein for like funding or whatever

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.880
it's always strange like well you know

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.679
the thing about gates and epstein is um

00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:45.360
there's an article from the evening

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.400
standard

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.640
the cover story

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.400
there's there's so many problems with

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.320
the epstein cover story but there's an

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.679
article from the evening center from the

00:22:53.679 --> 00:22:54.559
uk

00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:58.400
that says that uh spence or uh epstein

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.200
and gates were doing business in the 90s

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.000
that their relationship went back to the

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.840
90s

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.799
so if that's true everything that we've

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:11.200
been sold about gates and epstein is is

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.760
all [ __ ] which wouldn't surprise me

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.640
at all

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.520
because

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.600
with ebstein

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.440
the media has just been

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.679
into digging up salacious dirt

00:23:21.679 --> 00:23:24.000
they haven't been screaming the the

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.320
epstein article that i wrote which no

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.120
major magazine would touch um you know

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.440
calls for justice i

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.280
all these kids were molested we need

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.400
justice

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.880
and um but that doesn't seem to be a

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.919
priority

00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:41.200
and the franklin network was much bigger

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.960
than spence's network the franklin

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.679
network um i think was

00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:47.279
uh

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:49.600
was around for about 12 years and

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.600
epstein's network was around for about

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.120
25 years

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.760
but the franklin network was bigger

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.840
and i thought it was a kinder gentler

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.799
pedophile network initially but then i

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:03.440
came i've come to believe that um

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.440
because the franklin network

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.279
a lot of those kids were pandered to

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:08.960
sadistic pedophiles

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.200
and uh there was a lot of pornography

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.200
made child pornography and i think the

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.720
same thing was happening with abstinence

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.520
oh you're saying that you thought the

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.159
epstein one was quote unquote gentler

00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:19.279
yes

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:20.960
but now that i've gotten to know the

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.120
epstein network pretty well yeah um

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.960
epstein was pandering girls under the

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.679
age of ten um two eight-year-olds that

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:29.520
i'm aware of but i'm sure that i'm sure

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.600
that there were more and he was also

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.240
pandering these girls to really sadistic

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.400
pedophiles or some of the uh clients

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.000
were very sadistic

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.559
yeah didn't his first case get sealed in

00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:41.919
the same was that sealed the grand jury

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:43.840
as well yeah that was the one in florida

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.080
yeah that was one epson was like and he

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.679
got in trouble yeah i could be wrong

00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:49.440
here but it was like it was going to be

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.960
tried like a regular trial and then uh

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.120
rick ritt what's the guy's name he came

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.799
in and said no let's make it a grand

00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:59.039
jury so it was sealed well that was uh

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:01.200
that was very krishna the stage what

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.480
happened there was the uh a a 14 year

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.600
old girl

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.279
um went to the palm beach police

00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:09.679
department with her parents and she said

00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:11.279
that she'd been molested by jeffrey

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:12.320
epstein

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.720
and the palm beach and she described

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.960
epstein she described his house she

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.760
described his anatomy and the palm beach

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.679
police department started a year-long

00:25:21.679 --> 00:25:24.240
investigation into epstein at that point

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.840
and

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.760
what happened after that year

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.159
investigation is that they felt like

00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:32.720
he could well they had statements from

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.919
um

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:35.919
from five victims and then they had 12

00:25:35.919 --> 00:25:38.960
corroborating statements so they were

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.039
immediately going to arraign him on five

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.400
counts of child abuse

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.960
but then that case got taken away

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.159
by the

00:25:46.159 --> 00:25:48.159
barry kushner

00:25:48.159 --> 00:25:50.080
in the state of florida and then there

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.080
was a grand jury which is very strange

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.480
because usually grand juries in florida

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.960
are reserved for capital cases

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.320
so

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.559
and then that grand jury found that

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.240
jeffrey epstein hadn't molested a single

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.400
child and only one of and here's the

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.240
thing with that

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.159
the palm beach police department had the

00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:10.720
statements of five underage victims but

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.799
they were aware of 17 more so there were

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:14.720
20 the palm beach police department was

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.640
aware of 23 underage victims and that

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.960
prosecutor only called one so it's very

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.200
and it's very obvious to me that

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.679
that was a cover-up geez and then the

00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:27.200
matter was sealed but didn't he have a

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.960
sex offense under his belt after that or

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.279
something well here's what happened

00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:33.279
so

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:36.640
when that grand jury came back and said

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.720
that jeffrey epstein hadn't molested a

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.720
single child michael ryder who was one

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.799
of the heroes in this or he was the

00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:43.919
chief of the palm beach police

00:26:43.919 --> 00:26:44.960
department

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.919
he

00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:48.320
got very vociferous he raised cain he

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.360
said

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.520
you know and he went to the uh the feds

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.960
and they said you know this is obvious

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.279
malfeasance by this grand jury and

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:57.679
you've got to do something about it

00:26:57.679 --> 00:26:59.679
so the feds were going to get into it

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:00.799
they were going to

00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:02.640
arrest jeffrey epstein while they were

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.919
talking that there was going to be a

00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:05.360
grand jury and then all of a sudden the

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.360
grand jury was adjourned

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.440
and there was this

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.000
really unctuous deal made and and i've

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.080
got the emails between the assistant u.s

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.400
attorney and one of epstein's attorneys

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.919
jay lefkowitz and emery villafana was

00:27:19.919 --> 00:27:22.159
the uh the assistant u.s attorney and

00:27:22.159 --> 00:27:24.000
they're talking about how they can

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.600
minimize epstein's sentence and then

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.559
one of the

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:31.440
the emails says uh well there and the

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.559
deal that they made was so corrupt

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:36.720
that they had to go to a special

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.720
magistrate to sign off on it and

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.640
basically what that deal did is it

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.039
exonerated everyone it exonerated the

00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:44.480
procurers that exonerated the

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.880
perpetrators jeffrey epstein had to

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.360
plead guilty to a single count of child

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.480
abuse

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.120
he was sentenced to 18 months

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.919
in a county jail he did 13 and he had

00:27:55.919 --> 00:27:58.559
his little wing of the the jail decked

00:27:58.559 --> 00:28:01.600
out like the taj mahal so and he was and

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.120
he didn't

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.799
he could go out during the day so he was

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:07.039
molesting girls during the day while he

00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:09.520
was um you know supposedly

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.440
he was doing like nights there

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.200
yeah he only had to spend nights

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.399
yeah

00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:16.880
also and this is this was 2008 he got in

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.120
he got arrested tech i mean he did serve

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.799
time technically in 2008 for what like

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:23.760
13 of the 18 months so yeah he he did 30

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.120
but here's the deal with that kept

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.640
hanging out with all these people but

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.120
here's the deal yeah yeah yeah bg was

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.320
hanging out with him after bill gates

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.320
was still chilling

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.360
yeah the the feds had a list of 32

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.919
epsine victims

00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:39.679
32

00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:42.240
and they did nothing

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.640
with with any of that and and according

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.480
to alexander acosta who is the us

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.960
attorney at in in the southern district

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.240
of florida

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.080
he was told to back away from epstein

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.520
because epstein was quote unquote

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.039
intelligence

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:55.919
so

00:28:55.919 --> 00:28:57.120
and

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.919
to the kind of power that is required to

00:28:59.919 --> 00:29:02.399
get a us attorney to stand down can be

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:04.080
done by two people it can be done by the

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.679
attorney general it can be done by the

00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:09.279
president so that's how high the strings

00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:11.120
were pulled the same with franklin uh

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.360
the strings were pulled at the very apex

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.720
of power

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.240
jesus man

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.320
that's terrifying

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.480
that's [ __ ] terrifying

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.480
it doesn't it doesn't speak well of our

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.159
society yeah i want to see you on good

00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:27.039
morning america

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:29.200
but it's i don't know isn't it just it's

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.440
clearly it's he just clearly they're

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.440
just clearly intelligence

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.279
like there's no real debate here anymore

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:37.440
right um well

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.120
it's kind of interesting how else could

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.520
this be done new york magazine uh

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.440
conscripted

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.080
six quote-unquote experts on ebstein

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.679
and i was one of them and

00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:50.559
and

00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:53.840
i kept my teeth with epstein in 2012 and

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.640
i acquired his black book in 2012 and i

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.960
tried to sell an article about his black

00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.919
book

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:02.240
and nobody uh in the mainstream media

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.240
wanted to touch it finally gawker was

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.000
able to touch it and then we put his

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.840
black book up on the internet along with

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.399
a bunch of uh his with all the names

00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:12.640
yeah what was in the black book um

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.120
the names of i mean the names went to

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.279
mount olympus yeah and the black book he

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:20.000
had like 22 contact numbers for clinton

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.880
and 17 contact numbers for why why would

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.799
they keep a book i don't understand why

00:30:24.799 --> 00:30:25.919
they would keep a record of that

00:30:25.919 --> 00:30:27.279
probably so you don't get killed in

00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:29.679
prison yeah maybe yeah

00:30:29.679 --> 00:30:31.360
people like that are very arrogant and

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.399
they think that they can get away with

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:35.200
that oh yeah i mean they've had

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.799
jeffrey epstein had been trafficking

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:39.520
children probably since 1995.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.159
and and and actually he was the first

00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:45.919
time he was reported was 1996 to the fbi

00:30:45.919 --> 00:30:47.760
and nothing happened so

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.840
he thought that he could could do

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.520
anything he wanted yeah one thing that

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.679
was interesting the guy who got the

00:30:53.679 --> 00:30:55.919
black book who who took it out of there

00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:58.399
who took it out of epstein's possession

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:01.120
didn't i think he got 18 months in jail

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.000
he got the same crime punishment as

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.600
epstein did for moving the book for

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.760
except he had to go to his except he had

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.240
to go to a real prison a federal federal

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.159
prison what it's a guy who stole the

00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:13.519
black book yeah and now i'll let him

00:31:13.519 --> 00:31:16.399
tell it alfredo rodriguez

00:31:16.399 --> 00:31:18.080
he was epstein's house manager and

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.760
purlined the book

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.320
and um it ultimately

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.480
uh and then he tried to sell it to a

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.000
lawyer that was

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.240
launching civil suits at epstein because

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.080
he was representing these underage

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.799
victims

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:34.640
and

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.480
it's pretty interesting so

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.480
uh alfredo rodriguez approached the

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.039
lawyer the lawyer went to the fbi the

00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:43.679
fbi did a sting

00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:46.080
and got the black book and then that's

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.240
kind of how i got the black book um

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.039
can't really get the source but um but

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:54.399
alfredo rodriguez circled the names of

00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:55.679
people

00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:59.279
that he felt were part of epstein's

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:01.919
network and there's a lot of names that

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:04.640
are circled and um

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.240
and it's kind of interesting virginia

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.159
gupfree who was

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:10.480
one of epstein's victims has named a

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.640
number of the same people

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.279
in her recommendations who were some of

00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:18.559
those people um she named

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:21.600
barack uh alan dershowitz and both of

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.039
them are circled um

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.159
the

00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:29.440
prince prince henry right prince andrew

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.080
he's got multiple contacts but i don't

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.919
think his name was circled

00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:35.760
um

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.600
uh

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.799
let me see

00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:41.519
a couple of former mayor governors of

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:42.799
new mexico

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:44.799
uh bruce king and

00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:47.440
bill richardson were circled and the

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.120
thing about richardson he was also

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.799
clinton's uh energy czar so um

00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:55.039
and and then a number of big-time fans

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:58.000
financiers were circled too so

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.039
it was

00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:00.640
like with the franklin schedule it was

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.159
the cream of the crop

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:05.120
of of our society

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.799
jesus unfortunately the upper crust

00:33:08.799 --> 00:33:10.880
is a bunch of dough held together by

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.640
crumbs

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.640
or a bunch of crumbs held together yeah

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.360
i got that one so

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.000
and so and there's a link been i guess

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
so the link's been made between the cia

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.679
or like

00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:25.120
does anyone even know what they do

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.960
besides like doing like sex traps like

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.799
what else is uh why is that why are they

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:30.640
doing that i mean obviously to like trap

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.240
people up but like

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.960
power yeah it's it's all about power

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.320
yeah

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.360
and

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.799
the cia started with the mandate

00:33:40.799 --> 00:33:43.519
when it was originally when um

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:45.279
harry truman originally

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:47.519
started the cia it was it was a

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:50.080
precarious time joseph stalin had the

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.679
hydrogen bomb

00:33:51.679 --> 00:33:53.919
and joseph stalin was someone who had

00:33:53.919 --> 00:33:57.919
zero appreciation of uh humanity um

00:33:57.919 --> 00:33:59.440
so

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.760
but what happened there was the cia

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.679
started started its own funding

00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:06.799
mechanisms and and then also uh the

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:09.280
honey traps because

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.839
they felt it was too important that

00:34:11.839 --> 00:34:13.359
fighting communism was too important to

00:34:13.359 --> 00:34:15.200
be left to politicians

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.240
so

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.480
that's where this really dark part of

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.480
the cia comes in is um

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.560
the uh

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.960
various types of schemes to make money

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.560
and then and then also

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.720
the honey traps yeah did you talk about

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.200
william colby at all

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.960
in the franklin scandal i do talk about

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.520
william kobe who's william colby he was

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.679
director i think he was the uh former

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.639
director of the cia and actually there

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:43.760
was

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.320
in the church hearing there was uh there

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.919
was a senator named frank church in 1977

00:34:49.919 --> 00:34:50.800
who

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.119
wanted to blow the lid open on a lot of

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:56.159
the ci's nefarious activities and and he

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.760
did a lot um and there were two

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.920
william colby was called and uh dick

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.920
helms was called richard helms uh

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.960
richard helms was the then um director

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.200
of the cia and colby had been

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.320
the former director of the cia and colby

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.359
really showed people how nefarious ci

00:35:15.359 --> 00:35:17.760
was some of it's some of the stuff that

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.480
it was doing um but helms kept his mouth

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.680
shut

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.560
and what's interesting with colby is

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.280
he was actually conscripted the franklin

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.480
committee what happened uh when that uh

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.560
when lawrence king was busted embezzling

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.160
40 million dollars and wasn't charged

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.160
with single child abuse

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.480
um

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.160
there was a franklin committee that

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.320
formed that was part of uh it was the

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.320
nebraska senate was the subcommittee

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.920
nebraska senate

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.560
and they had a very good investigator

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.839
his name was gary carridori and a lot of

00:35:51.839 --> 00:35:54.400
the evidence that i have comes from gary

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.320
carridori like the list of the 60

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.720
victims that i am that came from gary

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.119
carricore um the flight receipts that i

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:03.440
got that came from gary carridore um all

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.839
this was put into a uh grand jury and

00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:08.560
sealed but a lot of the he was an

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.480
amazing investigator

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.480
and his plane um

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.200
what happened he

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.400
was the fbi was hunting for him i mean

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.839
here was the hunter became the prey um

00:36:21.839 --> 00:36:23.599
because he was finding victims and he

00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:25.760
was finding all kinds of stuff that was

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.160
that was corroborating these kids

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.839
and these kids were coming forward and

00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:31.520
being videotaped

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.480
and if the dominoes had started to fall

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.000
in nebraska they would have fallen all

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.079
the way to washington dc

00:36:38.079 --> 00:36:40.960
so it had to be covered up at all costs

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.200
and gary carridori realized that the the

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.240
fbi was trying to put him away

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.680
um for

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.440
scripting what these kids were saying i

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.280
mean it was you know none of the kids

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.599
said that but the fbi was re i mean what

00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:56.320
the fbi did in nebraska was very very

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.320
nefarious um

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.280
threatening perpetrators threatening um

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.480
victims

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.960
um so what what kiridori realized that

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.280
he needed blackmail pictures that that

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.160
that was going to be absolute proof

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.320
what was going on and he

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.000
got a hold of a blackmail photographer

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.599
named rusty nelson

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:17.760
and they met in chicago and i've got

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.000
five corroborations on this that rusty

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.560
gave him pictures in chicago

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.720
and gary was flying gary carradore was

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.320
flying back to uh nebraska and his plane

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.400
blew up in in midair and um

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.560
and then that was pretty much and then

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.280
the grand juries came out

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.880
you know shortly thereafter and said

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.280
that there was no child abuse and

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.160
there's that chinese proper kill one man

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.720
silence a thousand well with this case

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.280
it was kill one man and his son

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.079
and and silence you know ten thousand

00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:54.640
because uh nobody was willing to come

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.640
forward after that especially after the

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.200
uh the state and the feds that said that

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.880
there was no child abuse

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.079
but the franklin subcommittee

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:05.839
hired william colby

00:38:05.839 --> 00:38:06.800
to

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.280
look into the death of gary carridore

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.000
and he didn't say that gary carridore

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.640
had been assassinated publicly but he

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.800
did tell people that we're affiliated

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.640
with the committee that gary carradore

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.480
had definitely been assassinated

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.160
damn so

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.079
and and there were a lot of other

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:25.599
suspicious deaths in the franklin

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:28.480
scandal i mean every chapter there's uh

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.599
there's a strange death or two yeah uh

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:32.480
pseudo

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.240
suicides and things

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.440
yeah jesus christ man that's nuts

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.520
and the rusty guy that's the the guy you

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.720
were driving one thing i pulled over

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.400
with

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.119
yes i was um

00:38:45.119 --> 00:38:46.880
i myself was looking for blackmail

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.920
pictures and um which

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.680
i don't know if that was very prudent

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.880
but uh but i was and rusty said that he

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.680
had some now rusty is a guy that

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.760
he

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.400
he

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.200
takes blackmail pictures of adults and

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.359
children engaged in how do you how do

00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:06.800
you get into that

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.839
um i guess how do you get into it

00:39:09.839 --> 00:39:12.160
water rises to its own level i guess i

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.120
mean

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:19.120
[Laughter]

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.920
relationship would be too strong but i

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.400
forged uh kind of an alliance with rusty

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.760
because he was having a lot of problems

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.359
with legal problems and i said that i

00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:31.839
would help pay for his legal bills all

00:39:31.839 --> 00:39:34.000
he had to do was provide me with

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.839
um blackmail pictures which he said he

00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:37.040
had

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.359
so he took me on a wild goose chase

00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:42.400
to get blackmail pictures and um

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.960
we didn't get any and then i was driving

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.119
him home

00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:49.280
on this desolate highway and we got

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.800
pulled over and

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.480
and i started the franklin scandal out

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.079
with this is

00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:55.599
the cops

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:57.200
you know i show the cops

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.520
my id and he doesn't even look at he

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.320
says get out of the car

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.560
and then he deposits me in his car and

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.240
then um

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.839
and then he runs me through and i'm

00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:10.079
clean but then he runs nelson rusty

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:12.319
nelson through and then there's a lot of

00:40:12.319 --> 00:40:14.400
numbers after him and i'm sure that they

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.880
weren't nice numbers so um they take

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.880
rusty out and then they rip a cart rip

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.920
apart the car that i rented and um

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.200
all they found was my ginseng root so um

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.240
that was that was about it but rusty was

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.560
gave me a lot of insight i would never

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.040
use rusty as a sole source

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.480
but rusty gave me a lot of insulin

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.440
because i

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.800
you know one day i asked him you know

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.599
how does how does this work

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:41.280
and

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.599
he said it's like you're on a yacht

00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:45.760
and it's a beautiful day and you can

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.680
have anything you want on the shot

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.960
but

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.960
if you decide to get off the yacht the

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.000
people in the yacht are going to make

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.520
sure that you drown

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.440
so once you are compromised there's

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.240
zero motivation to come forward

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.040
and

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.880
it's very interesting um

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.400
i wrote about

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.040
in in confessions of a dc madam i picked

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.880
out some politicians who had been

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.640
obviously compromised one was larry

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.599
craig

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:18.640
and larry craig was a very conservative

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:19.520
uh

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.560
representative and then senator

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.319
and he was in washington dc for 25 years

00:41:26.319 --> 00:41:27.440
and

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.599
he had the worst

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:31.520
record of voting against gay rights i

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.599
believe in the senate if not the worst

00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:35.839
certainly up there but uh he was getting

00:41:35.839 --> 00:41:38.480
gay escorts from henry vincent who ran

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.400
an escort service henry was the guy who

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.800
i wrote the book with um confessions of

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.240
a dc madam so craig was getting escorts

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.160
from henry and then he was getting

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.720
escorts from elsewhere because uh kirby

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.920
dick's film

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.200
um

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.599
outrage talks about craig getting

00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:57.839
escorts elsewhere and then craig was

00:41:57.839 --> 00:42:00.480
busted in an airport bathroom in

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.000
minneapolis

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.520
trying to pick up

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.480
uh a vice god a vice squad cop so here's

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.680
a u.s senator here's a u.s senator

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.040
trying to pick up someone in a bathroom

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.640
i mean a u.s

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.119
so how hard would it be to compromise

00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:19.680
that guy yeah i mean a kid doing an

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.880
after school

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.280
you know project with a smartphone could

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.319
compromise yeah larry craig so he was in

00:42:26.319 --> 00:42:28.640
an airport easily he was in an airport

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.000
like it delayed he was like you know

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:30.960
what

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.880
you know it's kind of interesting

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.480
the old foot tap in the back yeah it was

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.400
the foot tap because i was i'm from

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.640
minneapolis and i've

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.400
been to that airport innumerable times

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.680
and i was

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.599
going to the bathroom once in one of the

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:45.520
stalls and somebody next to me was

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.760
slapping his foot on the ground and i

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.920
was thinking to myself poor guy he's got

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.680
to have like a neurological disorder or

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.000
something

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:56.640
he wanted to play yeah he saw your shoes

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.760
now an interesting guy is a fair game i

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.000
would have been pissed

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.839
and this is kind of interesting dennis

00:43:03.839 --> 00:43:06.960
hastert had a uh he was the speaker of

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.920
the house for seven years um from i

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.680
believe 1999 to 2006 and he was a strong

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.599
arms specialist but he he was a

00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:17.599
pedophile he had been molesting kids

00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:19.440
going back four years

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.359
and there was a whistleblower named

00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:22.960
sibel edmonds

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.920
who talked about hastert because the fbi

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.280
knew about hastert going to a a house of

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.520
ill repute well he was speaker of the

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.280
house uh a town in chicago so um so the

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.960
fbi and i knew

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.520
that hastert was a pedophile or chances

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.280
are they knew that he was a pedophile

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.359
and for some inexplicable reason they

00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:45.760
took him down i don't know why the feds

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.800
took him down and he had to do some time

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.440
um the only thing that i can think of is

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.359
he was getting too greedy and he was

00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:55.839
told to back off because he he had a

00:43:55.839 --> 00:43:57.920
lobbying business that just exploded

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.880
exponentially especially with turkey

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.640
so we don't really know the exact

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.119
mechanisms of what he did to be taken

00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:08.880
down but it was very strange that whole

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.839
thing

00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:12.240
but and then everything was sealed and

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.240
there was gag orders so we i was because

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.000
i was really looking very hard in the

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.640
hamster but uh i just couldn't get any

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.319
information at that point yeah i mean i

00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:21.520
could see the thing you're saying about

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.040
the guys getting on to like the special

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.200
cruise if you're like a rising star

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.319
politically

00:44:26.319 --> 00:44:27.520
you're probably feeling pretty good

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.119
you're like i'm the man i'm making money

00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:30.319
now you know all this stuff and

00:44:30.319 --> 00:44:31.520
someone's like hey come hang with the

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.119
big boys

00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:34.400
but you smoke a joint with him you're

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.280
like oh

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.960
yeah like a girl comes out and like yeah

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.240
by the way she was

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.839
uh yeah you get done they're like yeah

00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:41.839
she was 16. yeah it's like we own you

00:44:41.839 --> 00:44:44.400
now damn yeah i mean and that it's that

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.480
easy yeah and and when you think about

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.560
it like our politicians they've got a

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.520
potent psychological alchemy of power

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.240
lust and arrogance and and nothing makes

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.599
people stupid

00:44:55.599 --> 00:44:59.119
like arrogance and lust yeah i mean

00:44:59.119 --> 00:45:01.280
really smart people do unbelievably

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.720
stupid

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.720
because

00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:08.880
yeah that's nuts and if you if you don't

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.240
play ball they can probably just block

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.240
you out it all together anyway

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.440
if you're like nah that stuff's not for

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.800
me they're like yeah i think guys gonna

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.319
lose [ __ ] him yeah but i've been in this

00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:20.480
realm for 20 years now

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.599
and what americans don't understand is

00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:25.520
that

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.040
many of our politicians are compromised

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.240
and

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.400
take ebstein

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.119
for

00:45:33.119 --> 00:45:34.880
for instance um

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.440
with ebstein

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.800
he

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.319
was blackmailing some of the most

00:45:40.319 --> 00:45:42.079
powerful men in the world

00:45:42.079 --> 00:45:43.440
um

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.079
he had hidden cameras when the palm

00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:48.000
beach police department searched his

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.599
home in palm beach he had they found

00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:52.640
hidden cameras he had hidden cameras in

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.079
um

00:45:54.079 --> 00:45:56.720
his new york residents that maria farmer

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.359
talked about where multiple men were

00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:02.079
looking at the monitors and then and his

00:46:02.079 --> 00:46:03.839
island was also wired for audiovisual

00:46:03.839 --> 00:46:05.040
blackmail

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:05.920
so

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.359
it's so

00:46:07.359 --> 00:46:10.160
he was blackmailing people and

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:10.960
what

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.960
what people don't understand is i kind

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.359
of like jeffrey epstein

00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:17.760
a guy who is

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.000
he's from a blue collar family in coney

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.720
island he's a college dropout

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.200
a guy like that cannot blackmail some of

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.400
the most powerful men in the world

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.720
because they have access a lot of them

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.520
have access to thugs and organized crime

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.079
like les wexner is heavily enmeshed in

00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:36.240
organized crime

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.800
he was the the billionaire he owned

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.720
victoria's secret he was the billionaire

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.640
that gave jeffrey epstein millions oh

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.079
right right yeah

00:46:44.079 --> 00:46:45.200
and

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.319
if

00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:48.480
epstein was in fact he became victoria's

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.079
secret and he still had to go to the

00:46:50.079 --> 00:46:52.319
pedophile parties it's uh it's like bro

00:46:52.319 --> 00:46:54.240
you have it i mean you're just the

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.920
mannequins alone that's enough for me

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.839
yeah let's be in the mall at night

00:46:57.839 --> 00:46:59.839
because the mannequins alone i mean he's

00:46:59.839 --> 00:47:02.480
a he's an old frightening scary looking

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.800
dude i mean if i if i was a young woman

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.800
and he showed up i mean i'd i'd split

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.839
but anyway

00:47:07.839 --> 00:47:10.400
so there's no way that epstein could

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.400
have been blackmailing these people by

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.400
himself right there was obviously a

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.040
large organization behind him that said

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.680
to these people that were blackmailed

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.000
and and spence had the same thing with

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.240
the franklin scandal if you come after

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.319
this guy there's going to be huge

00:47:26.319 --> 00:47:27.680
retribution

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.839
and that's what kept i believe jeffrey

00:47:29.839 --> 00:47:32.160
epstein how many how many how many types

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.599
of those organizations do they are

00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:35.200
running because i mean they caught

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.520
epsine yeah but how many of those do you

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.480
think

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.680
like i mean

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.760
it has to be a pretty consistent

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.839
yes i i think that networks like that

00:47:43.839 --> 00:47:45.599
are ubiquitous in the united states of

00:47:45.599 --> 00:47:49.119
america um i because of the writing that

00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:50.800
i've done last 20 years a lot of people

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.800
have talked to me about

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.240
these networks

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.200
um

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.880
and they want me to investigate them and

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.920
i'm i'm only one guy yeah so

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.319
you know i i tell them you know i

00:48:02.319 --> 00:48:04.880
don't know if i can really help because

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.800
you can tell

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:07.920
when you see

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.559
um when you see major

00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:14.160
uh judicial malfeasance um

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.760
that can be an indication that there's

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.800
an a network there oh yeah it was uh so

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.720
yeah what i was talking earlier the

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.559
like in central pennsylvania there was

00:48:22.559 --> 00:48:25.200
the penn state the jerry sandusky thing

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.119
there was a i think a district attorney

00:48:27.119 --> 00:48:29.280
that was looking into the case

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.440
years before and he vanished

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.880
yes

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:33.680
yeah

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.720
he was found uh he vanished his car was

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.760
found um by i think a lake the river at

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.559
the river

00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:43.040
river and um

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.839
i did talk to a prosecutor under him and

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:48.640
she believed that jerry sandusky was

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.480
part of a pedophile network she she

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.160
really believed that and she believed

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.240
that that that that prosecutor had also

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.160
been murdered it sounded like

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.520
yeah i mean it sounded like it because

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.920
it was from the second mile foundation

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.839
which was a lot like boys town yes it

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:04.160
was for troubled kids yeah jerry

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.480
sandusky was doing this but then

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.559
it is a weird story i was at

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:10.160
the day

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.079
the first game joe paterno didn't coach

00:49:12.079 --> 00:49:13.760
so it was the week after that story

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.599
broke you went to that game i went to

00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:17.280
that game i was pretty excited about it

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.119
but we were supposed to go i went to a

00:49:19.119 --> 00:49:22.800
second mile dinner what a dude that was

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.200
high up at merrill lynch i think uh-huh

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.359
or one of those goldman sachs yeah we

00:49:27.359 --> 00:49:28.880
went to his house he was a penn state

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.960
alumni i don't want to besmirch him

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.000
because he might not have been a

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.240
pedophile officer yeah but

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.599
it was supposed to be a second mile

00:49:35.599 --> 00:49:36.960
dinner with like

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.599
joe paterno sandusky like all these guys

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:41.680
what and then i was walking around his

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.280
giant mansion it's just a picture of him

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.960
with every single president

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.480
all these things

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.599
i don't know it's just like you can see

00:49:47.599 --> 00:49:49.760
the political power these dudes have

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.079
yeah they have that power and then the

00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:54.000
one guy who's friends with all them is

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.280
doing exactly what they were doing in

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.200
the franklin scandal which is

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.680
getting kids out of a

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.839
orphanage type situation and

00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:03.359
banging them he was

00:50:03.359 --> 00:50:04.800
lower right

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.599
lower social media

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.079
predators predators know how to pray a

00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:12.160
district attorney just vanished was it a

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.400
district attorney yeah i can't think of

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.400
his name but yes he found his laptop and

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.559
the hard drive was taken out of it i

00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:21.599
mean dude like it was like yeah yeah

00:50:21.599 --> 00:50:23.760
that was uh

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.680
there wasn't there's indications that

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.760
that was a network

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.880
um

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.200
but i was and i pursued that for quite

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.920
some time but and i was i got

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.760
pretty close to

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.160
somebody who could help corroborate it

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.760
but i just i couldn't nail it so um

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.599
and and that's the thing investigations

00:50:43.599 --> 00:50:44.480
like

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.880
this like the the franklin scandal it

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.680
took seven years to investigate that

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.559
and

00:50:50.559 --> 00:50:52.559
i've been investigating epstein since

00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:54.720
2012 i'm ready to write a really good

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.440
book on epstein i'm finishing up one

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.160
book and i'd like to write because so

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.440
many of you keep that quiet until it's

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.720
out so

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.960
so many of the books on ebstein have

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.640
been um epstein light like filthy rich

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.400
on netflix yeah the netflix show was

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.079
like terrible i turned it off but it

00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:13.280
wasn't really i didn't even watch they

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.040
don't even come close

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.559
they do the same thing with sandusky

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:18.000
where they're like yeah it was just one

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.640
guy we got him it's like no you're

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.920
talking about yeah i never thought about

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.280
the grand jury thing before that is kind

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.040
of an indicator be like well let's do

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.119
like a special trial for this guy it's

00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:28.400
like yeah i never i didn't even know

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.920
what those things were to be honest i

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.200
thought that was like oh you're in

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.319
trouble

00:51:32.319 --> 00:51:34.559
yeah americans have no idea about grand

00:51:34.559 --> 00:51:37.359
juries yeah and how easy they are to uh

00:51:37.359 --> 00:51:39.280
to corrupt so

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.920
it's unfortunate that so many americans

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.880
are unaware of so many things yeah

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.880
about their judiciary it's also it's

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.319
like the same reason people don't

00:51:48.319 --> 00:51:50.480
weren't taking your articles it's like

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.760
people don't want to like they don't

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.800
want to know

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.400
if i told this to my dad he'd be like

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.119
what yeah shut up like you'd be like i

00:51:57.119 --> 00:51:58.640
don't want to even think about this you

00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.920
know like there's creeps like there's

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.839
creeps out there yeah

00:52:01.839 --> 00:52:02.559
but

00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:04.559
my uh there's only one member of my

00:52:04.559 --> 00:52:07.119
family that reads anything i write

00:52:07.119 --> 00:52:08.880
so um

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.000
yes

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.520
i mean

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.920
but if you want to be an ostrich

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.000
and stick your head in the sand i mean

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.400
the evil is only going to get larger and

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.559
larger and larger i mean and and that's

00:52:20.559 --> 00:52:22.160
the problem

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.000
as i said earlier a huge problem has

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.400
been the media the media was into

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.880
digging up salacious dirt and that was

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.920
that was it no one called for um any

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.640
kind of justice the new york times

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.599
did an article that named six procurers

00:52:37.599 --> 00:52:39.359
aka pimps

00:52:39.359 --> 00:52:41.760
and the only one that's been indicted is

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.119
is maxwell

00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:44.240
yes so

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.040
there and if this was if if epstein was

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.800
an actual

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.440
trial if if there was jurisprudence that

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.240
was that wasn't corrupted

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.520
those uh

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.400
those

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.960
procurers we know more than six but you

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.480
could start with those six those six

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.319
procures would be indicted on multiple

00:53:02.319 --> 00:53:04.160
accounts of child trafficking account of

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.559
child trafficking uh goes is anywhere

00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:09.599
from 15 years to life so you could rack

00:53:09.599 --> 00:53:11.040
up they could all be looking at a

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.119
thousand years or whatever

00:53:13.119 --> 00:53:14.960
and then you'd get them to flip on the

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.119
perps i mean that's how the mafia was

00:53:17.119 --> 00:53:19.440
taken down yeah you get the lower people

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.119
on the lower echelon to flip on the

00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:22.720
higher echelon and reduce their

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.960
sentences but there's been none of that

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.040
glenn maxwell is

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.040
and and

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.599
the glen maxwell trial was such a

00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:33.359
travesty of justice

00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:34.720
um

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.640
the the

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.200
girls are women now who really knew a

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.200
lot about the network and who were

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.559
molested by

00:53:42.559 --> 00:53:44.000
some very powerful people none of them

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.119
were called it was just uh the only

00:53:47.119 --> 00:53:48.480
people the only victims that were called

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.640
i think it was only four were molested

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.599
by just epstein and uh and max has

00:53:53.599 --> 00:53:56.160
maxwell been sentenced to anything yet

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.240
no she has not been sentenced and

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.559
there's that judicial problem of one of

00:54:00.559 --> 00:54:02.559
the uh jurors

00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:03.599
um

00:54:03.599 --> 00:54:05.680
saying that he had been molested and

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.480
maxwell i don't know how that's winning

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.559
right now but the whole thing

00:54:10.559 --> 00:54:12.160
everything about

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.240
epstein there's nothing rational about

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.920
it nothing makes sense

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.839
um

00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:19.599
laws of the land have just been thrown

00:54:19.599 --> 00:54:21.760
in the toilet how did uh how did you

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:22.880
feel when they

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.440
well when he committed suicide allegedly

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.119
did you know that was coming or because

00:54:27.119 --> 00:54:28.720
i think it seemed like everyone was like

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.480
they're going to kill him and then one

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.079
day the cameras didn't work and the

00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:33.760
guards took a break well the guys that

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.640
could break the cameras didn't work i am

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.880
i mean

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:41.440
[Laughter]

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.240
it's certainly very suspicious yeah

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.599
i don't think there's ever been more of

00:54:45.599 --> 00:54:47.760
a clear

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.760
somebody killed him case yeah i mean

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.440
there was a guy in prison that the whole

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.960
world was saying

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.480
they're gonna kill him

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.480
and then one day i mean they knew the

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.839
guards knew

00:54:57.839 --> 00:55:00.000
this guy's a risk

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.760
and then one day the

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.119
again the cameras didn't work and the

00:55:03.119 --> 00:55:05.839
guards were taking a walk yeah i mean

00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:07.680
there's there's a lot of anomalies the

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.640
uh

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.559
uh his cellmate was taken out of the

00:55:10.559 --> 00:55:11.440
cell

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.960
um i didn't even know he had a cell mate

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.720
yeah he had a cell mate what the guy got

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.799
taken out of the cell and then he yeah

00:55:16.799 --> 00:55:18.559
it's just great that was crazy man what

00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:21.839
are you in here for

00:55:24.319 --> 00:55:26.480
somebody had been a multiple murderer at

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.200
one point a former police officer

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.400
and they took him out and um

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.240
what's kind of interesting william barr

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.839
our lustrious attorney general who

00:55:35.839 --> 00:55:37.680
helped now this is kind of interesting

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.119
this is where franklin and epstein

00:55:39.119 --> 00:55:41.920
connect william barr helped was bush

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.520
one's attorney general after richard

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:47.280
thornberg ran for the senate um

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.839
he barr helped cover up franklin the

00:55:49.839 --> 00:55:52.160
franklin scandal and then barr played an

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.559
integral role in covering up the epstein

00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:57.520
scandal they have and and barr said when

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.520
epstein um

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.440
killed himself heads are going to roll

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:02.720
and uh

00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.200
no heads rolled and actually the warden

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.240
um of that particular at uh metropolitan

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.520
correctional

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.559
facility in in new york she was given a

00:56:12.559 --> 00:56:15.200
cushy job in in new jersey that you know

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.440
she was what yeah i mean so thornberg by

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.760
the way wasn't he harrisburg's governor

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.280
uh

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.880
thornburg was pennsylvania that link's

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.040
second month yeah really what about

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.839
everything what about ed

00:56:28.839 --> 00:56:31.040
rendell um

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.200
he hasn't come up but uh thornberg

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.280
definitely helped cover up spa

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.079
uh

00:56:36.079 --> 00:56:38.000
the franklin

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.520
yes and then bar what and and then bar

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.799
yeah oh god thornburg is uh

00:56:44.799 --> 00:56:46.640
i believe that thornburg is is a pretty

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:50.000
dirty politician yeah the oh no what is

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.680
the guy whose house i was at i was oh is

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.000
that what nothing this is getting too

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.920
close now i'm part of the

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.119
park i know i'm part of the thing now

00:56:59.119 --> 00:57:00.960
yeah the guy was the reason i was there

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:01.920
was the guy

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.480
i was with was he worked with thornburg

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.520
what

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.079
and we were at a second mile

00:57:08.079 --> 00:57:09.440
dude see this is what happens when i

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.119
read the when i listen to this you

00:57:11.119 --> 00:57:13.359
started i started i'm like oh no yeah

00:57:13.359 --> 00:57:15.280
it's it's unsettling it is weird though

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.720
because when you do boil it down to like

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.400
you think about like little kids it's

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.079
just heartbreaking but it's been

00:57:20.079 --> 00:57:22.079
politicized the issue of sex trafficking

00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:23.760
i would say is

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:26.160
kind of pursued more by people who lean

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:29.119
to the right politically for some reason

00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:30.880
well actually there's uh

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.119
the feminists left and the religious

00:57:33.119 --> 00:57:34.000
right

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.400
are equally against sex trafficking yeah

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.359
and yeah

00:57:37.359 --> 00:57:39.280
they're strange for lack of a better

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.920
word bedfellows but um

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.599
i've been very disappointed by the

00:57:43.599 --> 00:57:46.960
anti-trafficking community because um

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.680
they have not been vociferous at all

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.359
about what's happened with epstein we

00:57:51.359 --> 00:57:53.040
know who a lot of the perps are we know

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.640
who a lot of the procurers are there

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.319
should be a lot of people in prison

00:57:56.319 --> 00:58:00.000
right now yeah but um

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.839
and it's really

00:58:01.839 --> 00:58:04.079
heartbreaking for me i i've spoke the

00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:06.160
national center on sexual exploitation

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.720
as like an anti-trafficking summit and

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.920
i've spoken

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:12.000
there at the last couple of years

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.040
and

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.200
i've seen them do very little

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.720
to um

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:19.520
to get this issue out i and a lot of

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.760
most of the anti-driving organizations

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.680
um unfortunately

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.520
have not been vociferous about this

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.720
issue at all

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:29.280
yes and it's it's it's heartbreaking to

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.280
me because

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.359
when the government doesn't work and

00:58:33.359 --> 00:58:35.200
when the media doesn't work

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.599
you've got a lot of anti-trafficking

00:58:37.599 --> 00:58:39.920
organizations they should band together

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.920
i mean either you're

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.839
if you're against child trafficking

00:58:43.839 --> 00:58:45.440
you're categorically against child

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:48.160
trafficking yeah and and here is an

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.319
obvious case of child trafficking being

00:58:50.319 --> 00:58:51.599
covered up

00:58:51.599 --> 00:58:54.720
and none of these organizations are

00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.880
getting uh you know making any noise

00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.400
about it which which

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.799
is very difficult for me because i know

00:59:00.799 --> 00:59:02.160
some of the people involved in these

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:04.799
organizations and i just expected more

00:59:04.799 --> 00:59:07.280
from them it was uh troubling yeah what

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.200
is so with the media in general how do

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.480
you how do you think like how much of

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.000
this stuff do you think they know and

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.280
cover up or how much does this stuff

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.359
just not come across their like desk or

00:59:15.359 --> 00:59:16.960
like if they had

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.280
any like specific roles

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.640
and like kind of

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.400
it's hard to say um

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.880
i will say this that i do believe that a

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.640
lot of people in the media are

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.599
compromised yeah and i i think people

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:32.480
very high in the media um

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:33.920
and

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.000
i don't know if this is true anymore but

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.920
uh but it would be close six

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.960
corporations own ninety percent of the

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.680
media that's imbibed by americans

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.480
and

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.880
i gotta hand it to the cia or

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.079
intelligence or whatever you want to

00:59:48.079 --> 00:59:50.079
call it i mean they don't compromise

00:59:50.079 --> 00:59:52.000
people at the i mean they go right up to

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.680
the top when they when they compromise

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.640
somebody

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.160
so

00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:00.160
i don't know exactly uh

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.400
i've got some suspicions about who's

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.359
compromised and who's not um

01:00:05.359 --> 01:00:08.720
but i don't know exactly but i will say

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.000
this that

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.119
um

01:00:11.119 --> 01:00:13.359
the way that the media reacted to this

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:14.799
with uh just

01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:16.799
you know as i said earlier just kicking

01:00:16.799 --> 01:00:19.599
out salacious dirt it just was uh you

01:00:19.599 --> 01:00:22.000
know it was it was an embarrassment for

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.079
me as a journalist to see yeah

01:00:26.079 --> 01:00:28.079
the way that the media handled this yeah

01:00:28.079 --> 01:00:29.520
it seems like all they ever do is post a

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.280
picture of

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.559
trump with

01:00:32.559 --> 01:00:35.839
maxwell yeah yeah they never look into

01:00:35.839 --> 01:00:38.640
anybody who's guilty of or not guilty

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.920
but who's been

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.839
named

01:00:40.839 --> 01:00:43.119
yeah virginia guffrey named a bunch of

01:00:43.119 --> 01:00:44.640
them and and her

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.880
in a deposition and her deposition was

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.240
unsealed and

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.760
a number of the people that she named

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.319
were circled by alfredo rodriguez in the

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:53.839
black book

01:00:53.839 --> 01:00:56.720
so there you've got double corroboration

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.799
and um but none of them have been

01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:00.559
arrested i don't even know if any of

01:01:00.559 --> 01:01:02.880
them have been questioned i mean it's um

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.640
prince andrew got hit he got like but

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.000
it's weird it's like

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.440
it seemed like he settled with people

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.880
didn't he didn't he settled out of court

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.040
yeah i think i mean i've heard 12

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.079
million but i'm not exactly sure so but

01:01:14.079 --> 01:01:15.359
he you know that's kind of i think i

01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:17.760
think his mommy uh came in his mommy

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.880
came in he came in oh my god man

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.640
that's embarrassing god you guys you got

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.839
to wake your mom up in the middle of the

01:01:23.839 --> 01:01:25.200
night be like you guys stand in the

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.280
doorway

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.280
can i play with you for a little mother

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.599
i'm in trouble

01:01:31.599 --> 01:01:33.680
oh what did you do andrew remember that

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.599
cool island i was going to go to the

01:01:35.599 --> 01:01:38.240
cool parties with the other 12 year olds

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.839
yeah so he got i mean

01:01:39.839 --> 01:01:42.000
his apology that one interview he came

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.160
on and was just like i'll admit i let my

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.079
flap down that was his whole yeah yeah

01:01:46.079 --> 01:01:48.240
well he also said he didn't sweat too

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.319
yeah

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.720
i mean it really i mean it really showed

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.680
how stupid he is yeah i mean um and i

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.039
don't know

01:01:57.039 --> 01:01:58.880
i think it might be too much royal

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.160
inbreeding

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:03.039
europeans but uh yeah at that bbc

01:02:03.039 --> 01:02:05.039
interview he really showed i mean it's

01:02:05.039 --> 01:02:06.880
also he's probably just so out of touch

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.280
with talking to any normal people for

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.799
sure normally i'm i'm sure he spent his

01:02:10.799 --> 01:02:13.119
whole life saying i don't sweat and then

01:02:13.119 --> 01:02:14.400
everyone in the room went oh wow that's

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.680
really interesting

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.839
not one person ever was like what well

01:02:17.839 --> 01:02:19.280
the messaging's weird cause they're like

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.119
i absolutely did not do that i just

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:22.960
apologize i let my side down also here's

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.559
12 million it's like

01:02:24.559 --> 01:02:26.640
so wait yeah what did you do dude if

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.839
someone's like you must have kids like

01:02:27.839 --> 01:02:29.359
no i [ __ ] did it like give us 12

01:02:29.359 --> 01:02:31.200
million bucks i'm like no yeah i didn't

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.160
list anything i don't have it

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.599
that's that's the weirdest part to me

01:02:35.599 --> 01:02:36.799
when it's like

01:02:36.799 --> 01:02:38.319
well i absolutely did not but i would

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:40.319
apologize it wasn't miss has it have any

01:02:40.319 --> 01:02:42.160
have anybody else uh prince andrew but

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.599
has any other have any of these other

01:02:43.599 --> 01:02:45.119
people that have been named come out and

01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:46.799
talked about it or been

01:02:46.799 --> 01:02:48.400
because anytime i see bill gate although

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.720
bill gates was never really bill named

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.559
in those books was he dude he hung out

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:54.319
with no he was weak no i know he was on

01:02:54.319 --> 01:02:56.400
like this bill gates wasn't but

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.520
i think that

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.839
according as i said earlier that evening

01:02:59.839 --> 01:03:02.079
standard article said that gates and

01:03:02.079 --> 01:03:04.640
epstein go back to the 1990s that's so

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:07.280
great if that's true i mean i don't see

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.200
how bill gates could not be compromised

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.200
and bill gates is showing labidis

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.680
behavior amongst his employees so yeah

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.839
really

01:03:14.839 --> 01:03:17.039
yeah good way to put it too beating this

01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:18.319
behaviors

01:03:18.319 --> 01:03:20.000
so

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.359
nerdy nice predatory yes

01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:26.319
so it's it's difficult to know i mean if

01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:28.960
epstein and gates go back that far i i

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.799
do not see how bill gates could not be

01:03:30.799 --> 01:03:33.280
compromised yeah yeah well he hung out

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.799
with him he spent a weekend at his place

01:03:34.799 --> 01:03:36.000
post

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.039
after person yeah he was like

01:03:39.039 --> 01:03:41.200
yeah my bad that was an oversight of my

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.880
half i needed money from him yeah he's

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.559
like well he's dead now

01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:46.720
i i know that was that was his thing he

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.520
said he said well he's dead now so

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.960
yeah i mean it just it's hard for people

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.240
to wrap their heads around you know

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.440
because it doesn't mean like every

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.480
single person in the government is

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.880
corrupt it's just there are psychos that

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.799
don't get stopped and you know oh yeah

01:03:58.799 --> 01:04:00.559
was there ever because i i remember

01:04:00.559 --> 01:04:02.799
after the epstein suicide wasn't there

01:04:02.799 --> 01:04:04.240
another it was somebody who did the

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.079
autopsy that said this was conducive

01:04:06.079 --> 01:04:08.240
with hanging or not hanging from

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.280
self-hang but he there was

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.480
there's been a number of people that

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.599
have come out uh julie brown of uh

01:04:15.599 --> 01:04:17.200
miami herald who

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.359
wrote the three the series of articles

01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:21.200
that really added epstein she's

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.440
convinced that epstein didn't kill

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.799
himself but

01:04:24.799 --> 01:04:26.880
will there ever be an investigation

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:30.799
there's never been any investigation

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.599
i mean there's you know the last time

01:04:33.599 --> 01:04:36.000
there was an investigation it was the

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.720
palm beach police department in 2006. i

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.319
mean that was the last time i mean the

01:04:40.319 --> 01:04:41.599
feds

01:04:41.599 --> 01:04:44.079
as i said earlier the feds had a list of

01:04:44.079 --> 01:04:47.119
32 victims and they they did not indict

01:04:47.119 --> 01:04:49.920
epstein on one single count of child

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.079
abuse um

01:04:52.079 --> 01:04:56.079
and it's very it's very obvious that

01:04:56.079 --> 01:04:58.640
epstein everything that he did had been

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.799
covered up and as i said earlier the

01:05:00.799 --> 01:05:05.520
first known reports of epstein

01:05:06.079 --> 01:05:08.880
of victims going to the fbi were the

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.000
farmer sisters went to the fbi in 1996.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
so epstein's been covered up all those

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.440
years

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:17.359
which is

01:05:17.359 --> 01:05:18.559
and

01:05:18.559 --> 01:05:20.400
like with the franklin scandal the

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.240
franklin scandal was a huge network it

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.079
was bigger than epstein's um wasn't as

01:05:26.079 --> 01:05:28.000
was around about half as long as

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.240
epstein's but it was much bigger naps

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.079
according to federal and state

01:05:32.079 --> 01:05:34.079
authorities not a single child had been

01:05:34.079 --> 01:05:36.240
abused um

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.960
that there wasn't a network i mean it's

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.039
and that shows you and then with the

01:05:41.039 --> 01:05:43.680
epson stuff that you know all the stuff

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:47.200
that went on like the cover-up in 1996

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.359
and then the feds covering it up with

01:05:49.359 --> 01:05:51.039
the 32 victims

01:05:51.039 --> 01:05:53.440
it shows how much power

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.160
had to be deployed yeah to cover that up

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.400
and and as i said earlier the only

01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.520
people

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.599
the only two people that can tell

01:06:01.599 --> 01:06:03.440
a u.s attorney to stand down are the

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:06.720
attorney general and the president so

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.799
someone is as i said earlier someone is

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:11.599
pulling strings at the apex of power to

01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:14.480
cover that type so when when the which

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.400
one would call it when larry lawrence

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.920
king got busted who was president then

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.880
that was

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.640
george herbert and he said he was

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.559
friends with bush right yeah he was

01:06:22.559 --> 01:06:24.880
friends with everybody did he have was

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.160
there things about like the white house

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.400
tours and like like bush having kids in

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:31.119
his house or in the white house

01:06:31.119 --> 01:06:33.680
craig spence we talked about earlier the

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.480
sociopath that lived in washington d.c

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.280
um

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:40.160
he took kids

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.319
and male prostitutes on midnight tours

01:06:42.319 --> 01:06:44.880
of the white house what yes

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.599
just and then getting hot dogs and

01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:49.520
pizzas to the one house

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:51.200
from chicago and that has been

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.680
corroborated really yes yeah male

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.039
prostitutes going to the white house

01:06:55.039 --> 01:06:55.839
yeah

01:06:55.839 --> 01:06:57.920
that's nice this is all bad

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:01.520
and and at least one underage stuff [ __ ]

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:04.720
one one at least one yeah

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.160
so just hanging there or like did they

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.240
say like what like there was like night

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.839
out like you checked this out

01:07:09.839 --> 01:07:10.960
or they imply

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.520
i think spence just wanted to show some

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:16.160
people how much power he had jesus man

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.319

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.799
there was no real ramifications

01:07:30.799 --> 01:07:32.640
sometimes and george h.w is just in

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.400

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.280
you know there's a little parade

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.200
that's a [ __ ] up that's so [ __ ]

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.039
crazy

01:07:43.039 --> 01:07:44.079
and

01:07:44.079 --> 01:07:46.799
you know the washington times uh

01:07:46.799 --> 01:07:49.599
broke that story and um and the

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:52.000
washingtons also broke stories about uh

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.440
spencer's home being wired for

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.119
audiovisual blackmail

01:07:55.119 --> 01:07:56.559
where what being wired

01:07:56.559 --> 01:07:58.240
um spencer's someone being wired for

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.680
audience oh okay

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:02.160
god so and unfortunately the washington

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.799
times is owned by reverend moon

01:08:04.799 --> 01:08:06.079
of

01:08:06.079 --> 01:08:08.000
unification church fame

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.319
they've done some amazing reporting but

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:11.920
they're tainted and then the washington

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.880
post did everything it possibly could to

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.359
cover up spence's pedophile network who

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.679
owns washington post

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:21.600
at that point it was catherine graham

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.520
okay and now her

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.600
son owns the uh washington post i know

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.839
her son what's bezos own i thought bezos

01:08:27.839 --> 01:08:31.120
owned the post um he owns part of the

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.199
post okay yeah

01:08:33.199 --> 01:08:35.279
and um and then before that warren

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:36.880
buffett home party did you watch the

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.040
show succession

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.880
i did what did you think about that in

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.159
terms of like because that's pretty much

01:08:42.159 --> 01:08:43.600
what most the show's about how people

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.040
can just completely spin the media

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.080
narrative

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.239
and kind of just move politicians to

01:08:48.239 --> 01:08:49.279
their pleasure

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:51.440
i didn't think i was gonna like it but i

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.839
i kind of got into it yeah

01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:55.600
yeah

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.520
well i mean it just shows

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.600
i mean and that's in a very fictitious

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.239
sense sure but but i mean i think it you

01:09:02.239 --> 01:09:03.920
know all art

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.199
reflects reality and and i think that

01:09:07.199 --> 01:09:09.600
that show really shows that the

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.239
reality of how easy it is to

01:09:12.239 --> 01:09:14.560
cover things up and to get away with

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.199
unbelievable malfeasance yeah and how

01:09:17.199 --> 01:09:18.960
how many death threats have you received

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.359
yeah midway through this podcast i was

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:24.080
like oh well we're gonna get killed

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.159
then we're definitely gonna get killed

01:09:26.159 --> 01:09:28.159
i've only had one

01:09:28.159 --> 01:09:30.319
and uh now i've had some very strange

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:33.359
stuff happen to me uh yeah but um

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:36.159
especially with my phones right but i've

01:09:36.159 --> 01:09:38.080
only had one death threat yeah what was

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.080
the threat like knock it off or like

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.319
there was um so this is it's kind of

01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:43.920
interesting stop being a party poop and

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.400
we're having fun

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.120
okay so earlier i talked about living on

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.839
an indian guru's ashram and and

01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:53.520
someone

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.199
who lived there

01:09:55.199 --> 01:09:56.880
we maintained a friendship over the

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:59.760
years and he lived in omaha

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.199
and

01:10:01.199 --> 01:10:03.840
my first trip to omaha

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.840
i knew that something had gone down in

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.120
omaha but i didn't think it was you know

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.360
big and malignant like it was i didn't

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.120
think like i didn't think that it was an

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.040
interstate pedophile network i didn't

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.960
think that boys town was involved

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:17.840
because

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.679
lawrence king was plundering boys town

01:10:19.679 --> 01:10:21.920
for underage victims

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.400
i knew something had gone down

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.800
so i went to i originally went to omaha

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.040
very skeptical

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.840
and i told my buddy um

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.040
dirk

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.360
uh you know i said i'm

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.440
and i i hadn't seen him for i hadn't

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.679
seen him for i don't know four or five

01:10:39.679 --> 01:10:41.760
years and i said yeah i'm gonna

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.760
go to omaha he goes why do you want to

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.400
come to omaha and i said well i wanna

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.199
i'm looking into this story and um you

01:10:49.199 --> 01:10:52.159
know he was a little

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.920
he was a little concerned about my

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.000
mental health at that point

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:56.880
but

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.640
so um i stayed in his at his apartment

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:03.120
and um

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.120
and then

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:05.840
the

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.760
nebraska state patrol started calling

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.760
his apartment i did this is 2002 i

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.080
didn't even have a cell phone and uh

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.280
nebraska patrol started calling his uh

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.360
um leaving messages on his answering

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.120
machine was this after you got pulled

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.719
over with the rusty guy or before this

01:11:20.719 --> 01:11:24.560
is this is long before well this is

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.840
this is two or three years before so um

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.840
so there was a a woman i was sitting

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.159
dirk was coming back from

01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:36.640
his work and i was sitting watching the

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.719
history channel or something like that

01:11:38.719 --> 01:11:40.480
and then oh

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.159
i i hear a knock on the door and um

01:11:44.159 --> 01:11:46.080
i

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.239
go look through the hole it's this

01:11:48.239 --> 01:11:51.360
really freaky looking woman

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.440
and she says i've got a book for you and

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.760
and okay so

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.000
by the time this happened

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.560
i'd interviewed a victim i'd interviewed

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:03.360
rusty nelson um i caught someone

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.719
following me

01:12:04.719 --> 01:12:08.080
um i was you know i was like you know

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.320
and and my buddy dirk was you know he

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.640
was getting you know kind of uptight

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.000
about it too

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.840
because we have

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.600
i mean i'd obviously kick the hornet's

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.440
nest and

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.280
so this woman said

i want to give you a book and at this

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.480
point i did not

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.520

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.360
my fingerprints on that book and i

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.880
didn't want her fingerprints in my

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.760
friend's apartment yeah so i said uh you

and then um

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.360
and and

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.800
and then i got her and then she

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.640
eventually left

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.640
and then my buddy dirk came in with some

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.159
groceries we're gonna cook dinner that

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:53.920

uh five or ten minutes

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.400
and then

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.520
so

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.719
uh

01:13:06.719 --> 01:13:07.520
where

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.440
dirk is making dinner and then she comes

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.880
back

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.199
and um and then

01:13:13.199 --> 01:13:14.960
dirk looks at her i look at her you know

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.000
through the

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.719
people and um i said dude we can't let

01:13:18.719 --> 01:13:20.159
her in this apartment and we don't want

01:13:20.159 --> 01:13:22.000
her fingerprints in this apartment yeah

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.400
we don't want our uh her fingerprint

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.239
on on that book

01:13:26.239 --> 01:13:27.040
so

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.800
what was the book did could you say i i

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.199

01:13:31.199 --> 01:13:31.850
girl

01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:35.450
[Laughter]

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.600
it is a very spooky dude that's

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.800
terrifying

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.679
so um

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.640
she decided to leave but her parting

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.719
shot was uh you're in a great deal of

01:13:46.719 --> 01:13:48.560
danger you're gonna get killed

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.199
and uh now that really

01:13:51.199 --> 01:13:53.920
uh short-circuited not only me but dirk

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.239
you know turk realized yeah you know

01:13:56.239 --> 01:13:59.199
this is real and um so we had a very

01:13:59.199 --> 01:14:01.199
nice dinner that night but we didn't get

01:14:01.199 --> 01:14:02.480
a lot of stuff

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.239
that was the part of the book that i i

01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:06.000
was going to sleep and then that story

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.320
is told and i was like that's that's

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.400
very scary that's scary

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.640
i know the look of a crazy like you know

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.080
looking through a people and seeing a

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.159
lady out there like true yeah like that

01:14:16.159 --> 01:14:18.480
type of oh they always stand like right

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.239
up against the door yeah i had a crazy

01:14:20.239 --> 01:14:21.760
lady knock on my door she i think she

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.280
was just genuinely a crazy lady and they

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.640
like i opened the door and her face was

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.320
right there i'm like yeah

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.719
yeah very scary well at that point i'd

01:14:28.719 --> 01:14:31.280
gotten very cautious and uh like i said

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.280
i didn't want my fingerprints or derek's

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.239
finger

01:14:34.239 --> 01:14:35.679
so uh good call

01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:36.880
but

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.800
yeah in an investigation like that

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.400
you've got to kind of

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.679
think about

01:14:41.679 --> 01:14:44.560
like before i went and got

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.800
tried to get pictures with rusty um i

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.000
made a video

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.760
of myself and i said i this is what i'm

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.120
going to do

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:53.440
you know if i get busted for these

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.480
pictures this picture i'm in pursuit of

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:59.920
the story um if i don't come back you

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.719
know

01:15:00.719 --> 01:15:02.400
yeah i mean you know

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.960
we pro obviously got the pictures so um

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.159
what do you do with that you just like

01:15:06.159 --> 01:15:07.760
put it give it to your friends yeah i

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.640
give it to mike what i did is um

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.640
all my interviews i put them on cds i

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.080
gave them to everybody

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.080
and then all the documentation that i

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.920
had it's in three different areas the

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.920
scary the scary part about it has got to

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.239
be that they don't really care

01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:24.080
who knows you know what i mean like the

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.360
way they did with epstein i mean they

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.280
blew up that guy's plane yeah they

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.040
killed epstein in front of the entire

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.159
country

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:31.920
oh yeah like it seems like they're

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.679
really not worried about it i think once

01:15:33.679 --> 01:15:36.320
they survive one news cycle it's they're

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.880
very clear it's done yeah yeah i think

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:41.040
with my situation

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.880
i was a freelance journalist and

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.800
i think that other

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.480
journalists had looked into that and

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.159
they put heat on them and and that was

01:15:50.159 --> 01:15:51.280
the kind of it

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.199
and uh so they just thought that that

01:15:53.199 --> 01:15:55.120
would kind of be the end of nick bryant

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.560
and um

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.880
and i can remember i was i had i had a

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.440
mentor he since died he was a journalist

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.760
and um we were walking to washington

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.440
square park and um uh you know as i was

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.719
looking up

01:16:08.719 --> 01:16:11.280
at the buildings for snipers

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:14.400
i mean i i left nebraska very freaked

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.640
out yeah and um you know we sat down and

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.719
he was uh he was a mentor of mine he was

01:16:20.719 --> 01:16:22.480
a great guy loved him deeply and he goes

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.480
you know if you don't want to pursue

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.520
this

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.239
i'll still respect you and um and i

01:16:28.239 --> 01:16:29.840
thought about you know i said you know i

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.000
think i have to pursue this i mean i

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.400
know about it i gotta do what i can

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.040
to to get it out in the world

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.360
so yeah it was and it's it's an

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.960
undeniable fact that a ton of kids are

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.280
sex trafficked it's like there's no like

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.960
you know this isn't like people like

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.239
people like to lump this like all this

01:16:46.239 --> 01:16:48.239
is all conspiracy stuff it's like well

01:16:48.239 --> 01:16:50.000
there are kids getting sex trafficked

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
there's been big sex traffickers getting

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.840
busted and then it just goes away so

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:54.960
like you were saying

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:55.760
like

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.120
the only people who can do that are you

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.440
know two people that's like clearly

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.360
something's amiss how do you how do you

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.440
get kids or what's like your this might

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.760
sound funny what's like practical advice

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.679
to like make sure your kids don't get

01:17:07.679 --> 01:17:08.800
caught up in this stuff as they're

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.239
saying now with like the internet they

01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:12.159
can kind of just contact kids online and

01:17:12.159 --> 01:17:13.760
like they look for kids who are like

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.440
slightly disheveled

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.679
well it's a thing i mean if if it kids

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:19.840
from a lower socioeconomic background to

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.920
the structural background they're uh

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.199
prime yeah there's nothing you can do

01:17:23.199 --> 01:17:25.199
for predators i mean

01:17:25.199 --> 01:17:27.120
and predators

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:30.400
really know how to pray i mean guys like

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.000
lawrence king and craig spence and

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.960
jeffrey epstein i mean those guys are

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.920
predators par excellence they they know

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.920
how to uh how to get children and um and

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.080
they obviously really don't have any

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.080
legal uh problems

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:50.320
so retribution so they can they can

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.120
get kids and molest them with immunity

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.800
jesus christ that was the thing i was

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.040
watching today was just about uh this

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.719
one guy would go to like football games

01:17:58.719 --> 01:17:59.840
and just build like a high school

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.520
football game like he saw a girl with

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:02.800
like an ankle monitor and he's like

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:03.840
perfect

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.199
she's cool i guess if you just see a

01:18:05.199 --> 01:18:08.159
girl without a dad yeah or parents yeah

01:18:08.159 --> 01:18:10.560
just like perfect that's and epstein was

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.199
also buying children in eastern europe

01:18:13.199 --> 01:18:15.760
too oh man um

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.120
didn't the uh

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.560
the satanist group didn't they weren't

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.320
they like breeding allegedly they were

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.480
like breeding kids for like the purpose

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.239
of selling them

01:18:24.239 --> 01:18:25.360
um

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.360
the finders there was like the finders

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.600
were uh there was a telex about the

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.159
finders buying a kid okay

01:18:32.159 --> 01:18:33.360
in um

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.120
in hong kong

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.199
and um

01:18:37.199 --> 01:18:39.440
and then there was also evidence that

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.719
the finders

01:18:40.719 --> 01:18:41.840
would

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:44.320
uh respond to people that were looking

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.920
for babysitters

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.080
oh yeah oddly enough if you look up the

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.520
finders because when i was reading the

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.520
book i started trying to look up

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.280
there's almost nothing

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:54.800
there's a great article awfully hard to

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.159
find

01:18:56.159 --> 01:18:59.360
elizabeth voss vos wrote a really good

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.679
article on the finders it's the most uh

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.760
it's the best rendition of the finders

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.960
that anybody's ever come up with and um

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.880
i did find one of those kids um

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.600
and um

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.920
i got to the grandmother i found the

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.239
grandmother and then the grandmother had

01:19:20.239 --> 01:19:22.400
taken on the finders to get the kid

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.960
and the finders had

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.480
really subjected her to you know

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.120
a tear just a lot of terror and but

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.800
she's hung in there she wanted her

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.840
grandkid her grandchild out of that cult

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.400
and um

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.840
i asked if the kid was only 17 at that

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.719
time or 16 and i asked if she would mind

01:19:44.719 --> 01:19:46.560
if i interviewed the kid and she said

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.239
that she didn't want me to interview her

01:19:48.239 --> 01:19:50.239
yeah i just you know backed off fair

01:19:50.239 --> 01:19:51.520
enough

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.280
so we're getting close to time here yeah

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.960
how about you got a you got a book

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:57.360
coming out you said it in july i do i've

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.280
got a book you were talking about that

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.360
it's it's called the the truth about

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:02.560
watergate

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:06.080
a tale of extraordinary lies and liars

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.800
and um

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.400
what you'll see

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.400
in this book is that

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.639
the watergate cover story is uh is

01:20:16.639 --> 01:20:19.600
almost purely fabrications and woodward

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:22.719
and bernstein are pathological liars um

01:20:22.719 --> 01:20:25.120
i've got them nailed in so many lies i

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.719
mean they even lie

01:20:26.719 --> 01:20:28.560
i mean they lie about important things

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.000
but like

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.480
bernstein's talking about you know he's

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:34.639
going out to talk to someone and he's in

01:20:34.639 --> 01:20:37.520
this storm and then on that particular

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:40.639
day there's no storm i mean so i mean

01:20:40.639 --> 01:20:42.239
they're lying about inconsequential

01:20:42.239 --> 01:20:44.639
things like that i mean

01:20:44.639 --> 01:20:45.440
so

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.719
i mean they're just telling lies and um

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:52.080
and bernstein said that he was

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.800
gonna he was ducking a subpoena and and

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.800
hung out in a theater where he was

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.159
watching deep throat well actually deep

01:20:58.159 --> 01:21:00.719
throat wasn't even shown you know during

01:21:00.719 --> 01:21:03.520
that period in washington dc so there's

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.040
so many lies

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.280
and and and deep throat woodward's you

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.000
know

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.880
sagacious source um yeah

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.960
i really show how that's kind of

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.040
impossible mark felt who

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.159
was

01:21:16.159 --> 01:21:18.560
out at his deep throat after he was very

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.080
uh

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:22.480
suffering from dementia and wasn't quite

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.840
there and and i do think that mark felt

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.840
gave um

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.199
some information

01:21:29.199 --> 01:21:31.840
but mark felt was living in um he got

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.880
fired from the uh fbi

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.080
and

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.679
supposedly

01:21:37.679 --> 01:21:40.560
felt would go by woodward's apartment

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:44.239
and if the the flower pot was out then

01:21:44.239 --> 01:21:45.679
that meant that woodward wanted to

01:21:45.679 --> 01:21:47.280
contact him and they'd

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.280
and would take all these cabs and they'd

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:50.239
meet in

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:52.000
you know in virginia

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.239
and um

01:21:54.239 --> 01:21:57.360
and it's kind of funny because

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:00.239
the the real critical information that

01:22:00.239 --> 01:22:03.120
deep throat gave woodward um

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:06.080
is when after felt got fired from the

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:10.159
fbi so he's driving in from alexandria

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:14.000
uh virginia every day looking up at the

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.520
looking over the patio but here's the

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.960
kicker um woodward's uh

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.480
apartment

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.639
faced a courtyard i mean you could not

01:22:22.639 --> 01:22:25.120
you to see to see woodward's apartment

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:28.000
you had to get out of your car and then

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.440
walk 50 feet and and look straight up

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.719
so

01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:34.639
i mean

01:22:34.639 --> 01:22:35.760
that's just

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.400
one of many things so the whole just

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.719
like as a summary watergate was like

01:22:40.719 --> 01:22:41.920
what was what was the thing you think

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.600
they were covering up

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:47.040
wandergate was um

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.960
it was a silent coup um

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.880
people

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.120
now nixon i you know i don't dispute

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.679
that the dude had some major psychiatric

01:22:57.679 --> 01:23:00.239
issues but um but what nixon was trying

01:23:00.239 --> 01:23:04.840
to do is he was he was opening up

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:08.080
china for uh called reproachment

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.520
diplomatic and then he was doing

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.040
strategic arm limitations with the

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.360
russians he wanted to really

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:16.159
scale back on nuclear weapons

01:23:16.159 --> 01:23:19.040
and what happened there is like

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:19.760
the

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.520
jingos in

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.639
the military and also in the cia

01:23:24.639 --> 01:23:27.280
really um

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.480
and and nixon was conducting these

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:32.560
negotiations um with a top-secret

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:35.280
communication system that the that the

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.520
navy have was called sd1

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.080
so initially the joint chiefs of staff

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.040
had an espionage ring against nixon and

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.000
then

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.040
the administration outed them and then

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.280
like but then the cia started to

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.360
infiltrate his administration the inner

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.480
sanctums

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.440
because all those burglars

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.280
that were busted at the water gate

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.679
except for uh g gordon label he wasn't

01:23:59.679 --> 01:24:01.199
actually busted at the water gate but he

01:24:01.199 --> 01:24:05.120
was busted later on um they were all cia

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.400
so

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.080
and

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.840
you know woodward has an extensive

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.480
background in intelligence and um and

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.320
actually the special prosecutor that was

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.280
able to get rid of nixon he has a

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.120
background in

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:22.000
a lot of connections with cia so

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.199
the cia was ex you know wanted to get

01:24:25.199 --> 01:24:26.719
rid of nixon and

01:24:26.719 --> 01:24:28.560
it got very

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.440
it had some fortuitous uh things happen

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.000
and then um and then but watergate was

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.679
like a completely a botched job i mean

01:24:37.679 --> 01:24:39.440
those guys should they were in the

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.120
watergate twice

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.639
and they should have been busted the

01:24:42.639 --> 01:24:45.760
first time but the uh the security guard

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.199
was cognitively

01:24:47.199 --> 01:24:48.639
challenged i mean he just wasn't that

01:24:48.639 --> 01:24:52.320
bright i mean at one point okay so

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.920
the force comes

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.600
yeah yeah i mean

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.800
no no

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.120
forrest gump made this guy look like

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.040
einstein

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.080
so

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.320
um

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.760
deep undercover he could have been

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.679
the ultimate deep throat the democratic

01:25:09.679 --> 01:25:11.040
national committee was on the eighth

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.000
floor of the watergate and um

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:14.880
the

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.280
federal reserve was on the sixth floor

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.120
now someone had burgled the federal

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:22.800
reserve a month earlier but at one point

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.840
and this is mind-boggling

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:29.199
um mccord who was a cia guy

01:25:29.199 --> 01:25:31.920
forever um led the burglars who were all

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:35.120
ci assets um up to

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:36.400
the uh

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:37.600
signed in

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:41.040
and went to and this is around midnight

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:44.320
and went to the federal reserve i mean

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.920
that i mean

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.600
and they could and and that security

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.840
guard was too stupid to

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.679
to call the police

01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:52.719
so they

01:25:52.719 --> 01:25:54.880
were like we gotta do it again yeah

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.520
so they had to do it yeah so they had to

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.360
do it again and that's the reason you're

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:02.239
here burglary yeah yeah i mean all right

01:26:02.239 --> 01:26:04.960
go ahead when you read the book it's

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.800
kind of kind of mind-boggling but

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:09.760
what

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.600
what happened what really happened with

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.080
you at least at least nixon got off easy

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.080
compared to jfk true

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.840
well it was kind of a nice thing they

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.040
toned it down a little they're like

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.400
we're just gonna fake a thing you'll get

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.600
impeached it's better than getting your

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:22.800
head blown off during a parade

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.880
definitely well the thing about that is

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.360
um there'd been so much blowback with

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.639
kennedy

01:26:28.639 --> 01:26:30.560
and the warren commission

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.880
uh like a majority of the americans

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.239
didn't believe the warren commission i

01:26:34.239 --> 01:26:36.239
mean the media has had all these years

01:26:36.239 --> 01:26:38.320
to work on them and brainwash them but

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.239
60 still don't

01:26:40.239 --> 01:26:43.199
think that oswald acted alone

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:45.600
so i think and then you had the death of

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:49.360
martin luther king and bobby kennedy so

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.239
i i think had you not had those previous

01:26:52.239 --> 01:26:53.920
assassinations the cia probably would

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.080
have assassinated nixon but this way it

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.320
was gosh it was a kind of gentler it's

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.159
almost like why way to go maxwell's

01:27:00.159 --> 01:27:01.600
still alive

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.679
yeah you know there's no way they can do

01:27:03.679 --> 01:27:06.159
that again just like that i hope not

01:27:06.159 --> 01:27:07.280
it's like every other i think they can

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.760
do every other yeah like unless it's the

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.760
civil rights leaders then it's oh dude

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.840
they can do it yeah yeah they ice them

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.199
pretty badly yeah they had a nice little

01:27:15.199 --> 01:27:17.760
run of assassinations there for a while

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.719
yeah

01:27:18.719 --> 01:27:20.400
more sophisticated like i guess we could

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.360
just

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.199
make up terrible [ __ ] about these guys

01:27:23.199 --> 01:27:24.480
yeah

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.400
a little easier well

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.239
i think that's it yeah that was awesome

01:27:28.239 --> 01:27:29.679
dude thank you that was awesome thank

01:27:29.679 --> 01:27:31.120
you so much

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.800
and uh yeah thanks for looking in all

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:36.080
this stuff it's pretty scary to do

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.280
you know yeah you keep looking at it

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.400
what are you just trying to find the one

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:39.760
thing that crazy ladies yeah i don't get

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.920
it out of it

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.239
i don't know you know it's once

01:27:44.239 --> 01:27:47.440
once i was on this trajectory

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:49.840
i wanted to see justice yeah i've talked

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:52.000
to so many victims i've spoken at so

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.800
many conferences i've interacted with

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.360
you know so many victims and i just i

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:58.800
want to see them get justice as they

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:00.480
possibly can yeah well it's funny with

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.520
the feminists too because they talk

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.719
about the patriarchy you're like alright

01:28:02.719 --> 01:28:04.480
here's a bunch of powerful men abusing

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:05.840
children they're like that's a

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.199
conspiracy theory it's like no isn't

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:08.639
that like your whole philosophy for how

01:28:08.639 --> 01:28:10.159
the world works like no that's

01:28:10.159 --> 01:28:11.840
conspiracy theory

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.280
it's like no it's there they are yeah

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.280
here's their names yeah there's kids man

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.320
it's little kids it's like and it's

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.520
definitely happening and it's you know

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.560
it's it's [ __ ] up yeah it's

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.280
uh had the media had any integrity

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.840
whatsoever

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.159
um uh

01:28:28.159 --> 01:28:29.760
washington dc would have been filled

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:31.280
with mobs

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:33.360
demanding justice

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.239
there was a similar situation in belgium

01:28:36.239 --> 01:28:37.360
and

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:38.719
it uh

01:28:38.719 --> 01:28:40.239
a hundred a couple hundred thousand

01:28:40.239 --> 01:28:43.120
belgians hit the streets really yeah how

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.080
long ago was that it was uh late 90s

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.000
yeah i remember there was a joke in a

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.920
movie i heard about in the movie in

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.040

belgium that's the only thing i've ever

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:55.440
heard about the belgium pedophile thing

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.760
it was um mark dutrow was the guy that

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.639
got caught and um but yeah that was a i

01:29:00.639 --> 01:29:02.239
mean you at that point you had law

01:29:02.239 --> 01:29:03.760
enforcement coming out and saying this

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.520
is a cover-up kind of like with uh what

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.719
happened with palm beach police

01:29:06.719 --> 01:29:08.400
department epstein yeah he blew the

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.320
whistle on it pretty yeah good for him

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:11.520
and they still cover it up like all

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.880

like i'm not saying i'm suicidal

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.480
