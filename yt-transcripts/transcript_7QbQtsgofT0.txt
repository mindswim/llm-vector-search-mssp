00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.450
with the hood you [ __ ] it's [ __ ] sick

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:24.040
you all got a stowaway as a hobby you

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.420
actually are exactly what I thought our

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.620
listeners work

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.180
seriously every episode I'm just like

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.530
alright I got a bunch of [ __ ] dirty

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.410
[ __ ] guys listening what I'm saying

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.810
right now so I gotta be racist and sure

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.030
enough here we are we did it we may have

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.410
supposedly word of mouth between dudes

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.430
on train cars with broken locks dude

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.050
yeah they got some good ideas about the

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:53.970
[ __ ] Jays Jays it's very spooky

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.140
remember that one tight about this way

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.030
mckusker was that your theory doesn't

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.220
toast in Jays I never said that

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.000
yeah I did we were off the [ __ ]

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
record I was discussing a historical

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.480
event I used to fight euphemism I was

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.040
listening to that in the hospital in the

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.810
delivery room after my son was born I

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.340
was like all the cast it was Monday

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.810
morning and the baby was like sleeping

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.970
sounds like the cast is up so I'm

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.320
listening in the [ __ ] hospital room

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.610
and then all of a sudden he's talking

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.740
about toast and Jays know I was talking

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.420
no no I'll put that in context because

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.280
there's a lot of bunch of girls in robes

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.090
named Jen got all upset about what I was

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.100
saying that it's crazy that happens so

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.410
like was that fit I don't understand you

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.760
were males again like it just happened

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.440
I'm like they were toast in jail no no

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.540
no that's what that's what the [ __ ] I

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.460
was saying I was saying like it's crazy

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.500
that the Beatles were like kite-like

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.540
yeah historically like timewise they

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.980
were kind of close to the [ __ ]

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.080
Holocaust real close like the Beatles

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.180
where the and we're still listening like

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.640

bucks yeah is it but technically we're

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.210
professional now going back to what

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:34.530
you're saying about all those hot kids

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.080

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.490
you like have an 18 year olds hot she

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.180

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.100
can you tell me on her birthday Oh

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.930
[ __ ] huh dude this does seem like a

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:49.590
press conference

00:27:49.619 --> 00:27:51.759
this doesn't seem like a fraternity

00:27:51.759 --> 00:27:53.409
press conference it's like a Petros

00:27:53.409 --> 00:27:57.940
press I didn't know I thought you all

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.009
right but here's here's an argument that

00:28:00.009 --> 00:28:01.720
we've had and this is an important

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:07.360
conversation for the culture so but it's

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.549
a long it's a throwback quote but Matt

00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:13.720
at one point defended the memory now

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.489
this is Matt so now don't [ __ ] think

00:28:15.489 --> 00:28:20.559
I'm weird the memory yeah the memory of

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:26.590
the texture is the word he used sex when

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:28.779
you were a kid no no that hears we're

00:28:28.779 --> 00:28:30.249
like let's say your sauce for years

00:28:30.249 --> 00:28:32.649
extra you want kids all right you're 15

00:28:32.649 --> 00:28:35.409
you [ __ ] another 15 year old and then

00:28:35.409 --> 00:28:37.570
Matt go ahead and laborat on that theory

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.460
you add now that we're in public I'd

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.220
like to see no I'll try I'll try this is

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.080
kind of damning but you know it's sighs

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.239
damning good it's here's the thing it's

00:28:46.239 --> 00:28:47.590
not damning here's the thing rinse your

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.600
spark is not even arguing for anything

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.279
my thing it's more of a conundrum for

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:53.109
older hot guys like us and we say hot

00:28:53.109 --> 00:28:56.619
young chicks no my thing is you or 15

00:28:56.619 --> 00:28:58.389
and maybe you have sex with another 15

00:28:58.389 --> 00:29:01.269
year old and like it felt good and then

00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:08.489
you turn 30 when you were both 15 number

00:29:08.489 --> 00:29:12.399
52 theory no so you were both 15 it felt

00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:14.559
good and then years later you still

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:16.059
remember it feeling good am I say you
