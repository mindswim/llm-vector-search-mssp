doug stanhope podcast listening to

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.359

going to a regional game nfl sunday

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.000

i'll bring it back in just to introduce

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.960
the rest of the guests because your

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.079
podcast listeners would have no idea

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:44.960

actually sam did kind of sam did kind of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.880
invite himself did he yeah i did he with

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.200
a lot of caveats i should have read that

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.160
today

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.200
when we did uh krishna's podcast earlier

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.080
i should have he was reading old emails

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.000
he said years ago so what happened was i

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.480
did bert's podcast and on it i brought

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.720
up the fact that years ago i had sent

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.319
and first off not that long ago it was

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.000
2016.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.599
he was the first guy i featured for so i

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.640
emailed him first off afterwards after

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.480
the show we did he was like

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.640
hilarious email me we'll set up some

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.599
dates

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.000
i want you to work with me again so i

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.680
mean that was the first feature i did i

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.680
was like holy [ __ ] this is it

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.360
which is weird because i've never known

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.280
bert to be impulsive

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.080
yeah

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.519
or hyperbolic

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.800
yeah so

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.519
for the next three months i emailed him

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.920
and uh it's weighed on me ever since

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.760
because he didn't write back

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.360
and i was like man this is it's so

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.560
embarrassing that i have those and then

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.920
when i was talking to him i was like

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.159
dude i [ __ ] emailed you

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.480
so many times and he while we're talking

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.760
because it was zoom he just brought up

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.239
his email and started reading them

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.480
and they were it was so uncomfortable to

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.560

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:38.880
true

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.560
when he was talking about dude so on

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.080
that podcast bert was like bring up your

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.320
recent google searches and mine was all

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.120
like underage girls

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.560
he was like read your google searches

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.240

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.400
pretty hot

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.199
then you gotta google

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.759
this is the brand you asked him about

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.160
earlier i think on the other hand i

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.639

he got it sam was all right on that yeah

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.800
because i remember when she turned 18

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.520
like the caption that comes up

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.360
immediately it was just her age

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.440

the guy had microscopes or telescopes

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.279
that he was like elevating to like

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:43.839
for this tiny guy and this guy was

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:44.959
getting pretty frustrated he was a

00:16:44.959 --> 00:16:47.120

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:55.600
indians showed up

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.360
podcast too so anyway the whole thing

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.880

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.400
which was fun to watch there's an old

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.839
couple that just kept arguing with each

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.280

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.799
forth to each other like very

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:38.000

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.960

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.600
a truck to drive down here but i when i

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.200

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.799
a small truck

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:58.720
like a the one i

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.919
picked in the website was like this

00:17:59.919 --> 00:18:01.520
nissan

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.039
i don't know what that era

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:04.720
no it wasn't an exterior it was a truck

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.160
but it was like a full-sized truck like

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.240
a f-150 socket that's what they [ __ ]

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.760
gave me but the one i wanted was a very

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.559
small truck yeah and i was like

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.720
they gave me

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.160
yeah this thing's [ __ ] huge that

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.240
looks great no i mean it does look cool

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.080
i love that truck but driving it through

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.480
the grand canyon was [ __ ] terrifying

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.760
but this was the night before so i have

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.440
this huge truck what you thought you'd

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.160
hit each side

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.720
hold on wait doug woke up for that one

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.240
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.840
this is high doug they sound like me on

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.720
camera it's a giant truck so giant that

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.960
it might scrape on each side of the

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.679
inside of the grand canyon you drove

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:45.679
through the grand canyon

00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:48.320
through the grand canyon take the lost

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.000
dog it's kind of like those concrete

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.440
barriers when you're driving through

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.000
construction in a large vehicle they can

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.320
be intimidating but with the size of

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.400
this truck a chevy silverado not what he

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.240
ordered at all he wanted a petite truck

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.720
all right sam has a similar story that

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.960
went somewhere without me

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.840
ruining it

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.840
that was good though see sam that's how

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.360
you talk your way out of the box yeah

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.320
it's like matt's here it is

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.240
so first off this was the craziest thing

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.919
i've done i picture the truck with those

00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:24.880
crazy balls the chrome balls is that

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.799
yeah but as you're going through the

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:29.280
grand canyon it gets animated as i

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.960
imagine it but the side scraping

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.840
well maybe they maybe

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.080
i feel like santa's gonna put it in a

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.840
meme nick

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.520
hurry up shank

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.679
he's gonna have a diagram no i had like

00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:45.520
the weirdest i don't know something's

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.200
wrong with me like when i landed i

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.200
bought this [ __ ] truck i didn't need

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.559
to the guy was like we have one truck

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:52.320
left it's just he was like you wanted a

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.360
truck right and i was like yeah that's

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.160
what i have on the website and he handed

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.679
me the keys and he was like it's a chevy

00:19:57.679 --> 00:19:59.520
silverado and i was like damn i think

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.880
that's pretty big and then i walked out

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.480
to it and i was like

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.160
i drive like a chevy cruze like this

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.600
thing's i'm not gonna be able to [ __ ]

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.200
drive this

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.280
i got used to it don't worry maybe you

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.880
know who you were then he figured you

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.559
were in town to drag someone behind the

00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:14.960
truck so he gave you the the most

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.200
sam

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.799
you're probably gonna have a lot of

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:20.960
friends with shotguns that need to ride

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.039
in the back don't don't are you writing

00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:24.240
down

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.679
scraping

00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:27.120
paper

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.120
how did you quit comedy no because i

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.679
just wrote this entire screenplay

00:20:31.679 --> 00:20:36.640
or whatever because sam talent has

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.840
on the same trip a rental car story

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.200
that is kind of opposite

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.440
to do and now i'm picturing the guy

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.080
trying to [ __ ] upsell you and down

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.320
sell you it's the same guy but you're in

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.159
different at least your feelings weren't

00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:53.919
hurt when yours happened yeah they tried

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:56.799
to put sam into a like a wagon mobile

00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:58.480
that's the smallest car possible sam's a

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.080
[ __ ] wagon no they tried to put me in

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.000
a big car because i'm too fat

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.280
so i showed up and they were like i

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.160
you've killed

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.520
that's a

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.000
that's a ridiculous question sam

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.440
the chat you're talking you know there's

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.079
zero uh statute of limitations on that

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:09.760
nobody talks about that he just pulled a

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.480
knife and uh he won't be talking about

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.160
it again we're down to three

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.800
he walked i'm out of here

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.920
oh man

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.480
so you you said earlier

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.079
you uh

00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:25.520
you drank coronas when you were younger

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.200
because they had thick

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.480
glasses so you could hit people with

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.359
them

00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:31.119
yeah i was violent when i was younger

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:33.760
for sure so i chose my beer based on the

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.079
the heft of the bottle now how often did

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:37.440
that happen

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.240
uh a couple of times

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.960
people in the face oh yes oh man i've

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.560
got that's the that rule that's the most

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.590
reasonable and mild of the stories

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.200
[Music]

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.240
i mean that

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.920
that actually i'm not even ashamed of

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.240
those ones those ones seem perfectly

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.320
logical yeah and chad's a big man if

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.680
you're listening oh

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.800
you could bring the rocket it'd be a

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.160
real bummer to get hit in the face with

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.359
a bottle did you ever break did you

00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:04.320
break it over the head or would you

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.000
break it on the on the on the table no

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.920
no you just hit him with it like a bat

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.920
yeah yeah a lot of times they don't even

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.440
break

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.800
solid

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.119
when you pick the bottle with heft it

00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:17.599
doesn't break i tried i don't think they

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:19.040
make it probably sounds like the like

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.960
the college world series that [ __ ]

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.320
ping off the back

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.240
you know i mean yeah

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.839
and then a dominican guy's running away

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.640
yeah i used to drink uh mickey's 40s

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.680
because they were a good tool of

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.440
destruction as well

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.119
you could defend yourself a little short

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:37.200
barrel looking uh no no

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.839
no oh yeah

00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:39.920
okay green

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.359
because we'd go to a lot of like rival

00:36:41.359 --> 00:36:42.800
parties in high school and have to fight

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.720
our way out of there

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.280
luckily that doesn't happen anymore

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.400
now when i go to a high school party

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.119
they herald me as a king but

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:52.640
like the conqueror is back well you can

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.480
beat everybody up i mean that's really

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.560
how it works yeah or you can threaten to

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.880
call the law the whole time yeah i'd say

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.480
i'll shut this party down [ __ ] your

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.040
girlfriend bring me the hottest kid here

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.040
bring me the boy or i'll ruin this party

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.800
it's like in blood marine i'm the judge

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.160
i just have an idiot on a chain

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.040
this is very spooky down here man

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.079
this desert yeah it's cool

00:37:16.079 --> 00:37:18.400
what do you think of the desert dog

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.839
oh he's just thinking about patrick

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:23.680
all right

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.920
junior high school

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.520
and uh

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.800
he was like a a giant nerd

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.040
so you see where this is going

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.200
so i was the picked upon kid but i

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.720
thought i could pick on nerds and i

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.000
[ __ ] with patrick dunn this giant kid

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.359
and uh

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:43.920
he [ __ ] picked me up like a movie

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.200
scene and held me against the wall

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.400
okay

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.960
and uh twice i've run into patrick dunn

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.040
the two last times we did ralph's

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.000
chadwick square diner patrick dunn is

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.599
still there and it's one of my few

00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:00.240
memories of all of middle school

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.079
he's like yeah i remember yeah you

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:03.520
brought this up last time you played

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.200
here

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.680
but you're such a [ __ ] giant nerd

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.240
like patrick dunn

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.400
when you just said like you hit someone

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.040
or even i had to fight anyone i was a

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.320
jock man

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.920
yeah but you were a jock that also was

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.599
in theater yeah i was i was

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:21.520
multi-faceted you mean

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.960
i've just seen that one i think it's

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.560
called half a second

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.320
oh yeah

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.560
i gave that up for lunch because chad

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.000
said that word but

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.680
that's called half of something it's a

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.000
false flag

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
you dwarf chad shank who is a huge

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.720
person to us yeah and i

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.960
but he comes across as a badass where

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.599
you come across as patrick dunn chad

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:46.640
would read you could lift me up but you

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.200
wouldn't you're a [ __ ] lenny mice and

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.079
men gentle you're a nerd i thought yes

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:52.880
like

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.640
like you know people were just cascaded

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.560
like i thought you would take brian

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.520
posein's mantle of a giant nerd that

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.200
could hurt you but he wouldn't even

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.800
think to do it twist the knife that's

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.680
nice

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.280
i've been a part of this he just stabbed

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.440
me with a blowing up knife yeah for

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.640
three weeks i've been a part of this

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.160
every once in a while doug will turn on

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.160
you

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.000
but no i don't i don't think any of this

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.240
is bad i know that's why you keep saying

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.960
no you just want

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.480
give him his credit yeah he's obviously

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.920
creating comedy but nobody you don't

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:40.760
want to physically be him at two duggay

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.480
it does suck to uh be known as a nerd

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.720
now that i'm a successful oh i see i

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.960
have a renegade i took the brian posein

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.280
thing the bat like i thought you

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.200
oh his looks yeah but he's a giant nerd

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.720
i came down here looking tough and then

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.119
you shorned me and dyed my hair i

00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:01.200
thought that's why you like [ __ ] all

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.280
the music chaley likes you're like one

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.440
of those you mean punk rock yeah [ __ ]

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.040
like that and the revolutionaries yeah

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.839
but those are almost always just for

00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:12.560
dorks i'm not listening to operation ivy

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.240
i did get in my car and play misfits

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.920
really loud so

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.720
after i bombed on bird

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.560
that's a good cleanser i do feel like

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:24.720
chad could wear my face as a mask

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.480
i don't want to pile on but whenever oh

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.839
god

00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:29.760
i want you to pie along because i forgot

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.560
what i was saying

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.119
whenever i was whenever i first went on

00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:36.720
the road with you guys and i met sam

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.960

it might be a false memory so you can

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.720

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.880
barefoot at the [ __ ] club and i was

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.920

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.800
that is

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.960
a very polite way of saying whenever i

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.319
had been hanging out here for a while

00:42:30.319 --> 00:42:32.160
before i brought my wife over to stan

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.760
hopes instead of just goes yeah that's

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.240
not what i pictured no i was like like

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.520
so i know what you're talking about

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.280
shane like sometimes you stand up will

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.200
just cut you hard yeah it'll hit you

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.839
with a hard one yeah and then be like

00:42:42.839 --> 00:42:45.040
what it's just like nothing man i'm

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.359
going to bed

00:42:47.359 --> 00:42:49.119
it is weird to be a big monster person

00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:51.599
and have a uh a pretty bride because i

00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:52.640

have the same uh effect yeah

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.599
and i think they fear our our power

00:43:01.599 --> 00:43:04.400
could be yeah

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.440

this is like looking into a mirror

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.960
