00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.830
to him when I saw him in concert when I

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.660

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.739

world that a wrapper bombing oh my god I

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.200

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.870
and they were same thing they're trying

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.310

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.000

you're [ __ ] talking about yeah yeah

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.110
yeah there's a fine line between like

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.650
you know the rap that comes out and it's

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.020
a sad sight to see someone as like God

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.720
like as a rapper just like Oh someone up

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.010

like holy [ __ ] I mean that's what's

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.630
that's what's so bizarre about a rap

concert it's like it's it's not as a

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.960
bunch of people on stage with

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.220
instruments and like trying to play

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.260
music it's just it's just a big persona

I'm not disagreeing be reals definitely

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.039

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:03.139
sick delay if I get to sit in a room or

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:05.000

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.110
company when they do a podcast together

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.250

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.560
motivation 101 dude he was motivated

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.360
like oh you smoke weed basically they're

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.010
like you get high every day he was like

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.530

like I don't want to be a loser

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.200
so I work hard there's like lazy that's

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.030
just that's just lazy that's not the

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.370
weed you're just lazy I was sitting in

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.290

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.660
does yeah well that's a funny um that

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.250
idea where people pay all that money to

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.560
be like cryogenically frozen and they're

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.520
like alright and then like they're gonna

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.980
get the technology down it's like yeah

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.600
that's assuming like this [ __ ] it like

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.220
the country doesn't collapse in [ __ ]

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.410
150 years yeah so just because the

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.970
science exists doesn't mean like that

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.050

hundred years or anything all right like

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.140

kind of mind-bending try to always stay

00:29:28.649 --> 00:29:29.610
in the present moment

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.740
which sounds like kind of cliched but

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.710
you literally like empty your mind and

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.350
just all you do is you just chill chill

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.059
chill and you don't think about anything

00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:40.440
or do anything until the moment of

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.679

the doubt is [ __ ] the ground it's

00:29:59.669 --> 00:30:01.320
really hard to do and then you have to

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.450
dislike the whole time like you're you

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.250

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:01.430
[ __ ] charm you go to your tomb

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.429
I did I remembered like the [ __ ] I was

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:09.870
thinking about and it just literally

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:12.419
dude just as it's gone yeah

00:34:12.419 --> 00:34:15.720
by the the anxiety the post anxiety is

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.340
the worst though that's why that's

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.310
what's been for hangover yeah party time

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.169
the party months I've been on

00:34:22.169 --> 00:34:24.090
back-to-back party months yeah

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.190
anxiety's been just a complete roller

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.270
coaster well that's it I mean that's

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.010
what alcohol does it definitely kills

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:30.360
your anxiety but then your body's just

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.030
like [ __ ] Sonic the Hedgehog spinning

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.320
in his little ball as soon as you wake

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:45.510
up done hit that [ __ ] blunt though

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.990
yes coins shatter just back the [ __ ]

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:53.030
sonic debuted I so I forgot about this I

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.250
ordered I went online and ordered this

00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:00.150
it's called medicinal hemp you can buy

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:03.120
it online and it's just it's weed with

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.360
just like low THC and high CBD so it's

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.280
like the old duals of weed kind of yeah

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.710
but it's weed nonetheless and you can

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.420
just buy it online it's legal they

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.390
mailed me it Wow yeah I got [ __ ] like

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:18.420
three ounces of weed mailed to me legal

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.800
there's a piece of paper on it that says

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.750
this is medicinal hemp it's not weed

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:23.710
you're like for real that's

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:28.030
are you gonna do not weed like

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:29.589
technically this is medicinal hemp

00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:32.560
because it's lower than 0.03 THC purple

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.810
get you high door it just relaxes you a

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:37.900
little bit it's like smoking like really

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.000
weak weed but it's nice sounds like

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.580
something I would like it's kind of nice

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.619
and you know if you're if you're feeling

00:35:44.619 --> 00:35:46.210
yourself I just take a little bit of

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.650
hash and sprinkle it on it and it's like

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.800
nice little buffer zone dude yeah it's

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.000
[ __ ] but it's like what George

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.490
Washington used to smoke Haley it's

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.589
[ __ ] sick dude I have a bunch of weed

00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:58.180
weird weed that I got in the mail from

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.270
like a company I was like no way it

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:02.619
[ __ ] works and they send it to me and

00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:05.470
I'm like just outdoor weed and they grow

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:08.200
it so it's um yeah they like try to like

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.300
take down the tea but dude here's my

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.240
thing - these are wheat growers they

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.880
probably tested a batch I don't think

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.070
they hit the [ __ ] point O three THC

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:20.800
yeah so it's like yeah of course not

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.570
you know what I mean it's a plant yeah

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:28.270
so you know I it's a THC a - so it's

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.710
like technically it's not THC because

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.720
it's a THC a so they can pickle it only

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.240
has this much THC but I'm gonna saying

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.710
the THC a is in there and as soon as you

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:41.830
burn it what's it turn into now I have a

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.900
bunch of CBD I have O'Doul's we eat at

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.540
my house I'm like so [ __ ] sick I just

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.800
want to start smoking joints like

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.839
cigarettes everywhere you smoke like ten

00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:51.070
and joints of this [ __ ] a day and you're

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:53.020
just yeah I mean it does it makes you

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.849
kind of tired though like smoked in one

00:36:54.849 --> 00:36:58.260

with them now have like elephant skull

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.300
that's [ __ ] tight that's what I don't

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:49.920
get there they're like hardcore like

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.080
cholos but then they talk about how

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.150
great weed is yeah dude

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.610
let's do they they talk about like I'll

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:58.680
[ __ ] murder you then the next song is

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.640
like I feel good a lot yeah that guy

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.410
came up like it's a hardcore weed

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:06.900
growing cholo dude the whole time I was

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.100
also thinking like this is just Nate

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.520
Diaz music this is Nate Diaz holy [ __ ]

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.380
that's his entire being or Sona

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.990
dude that literally shaped name you

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.780
can't say cypher zilla's not Nate Diaz I

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.880
mean it's a perfect dialectic dude it's

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.470
like those two don't exist without each

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.600
other it's a perfect dyad there wasn't

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.100
sober so there wouldn't be Nate Diaz and

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.660
you know maybe Nate Diaz expected

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.040
Cypress Hill they definitely feed off

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:29.550
each other

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.020
yeah that's those two definitely you

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.690
have energies I can imagine Nate Diaz in

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:35.100
[ __ ] grade school dude you should

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.870
have an ancient aliens about that about

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:40.290
what polar energy that those two create

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:42.180
maybe that was aliens that created

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.100
videos in cyber so I've been reading a

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.850
lot about like a lot of like infant

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:49.470
developmental theories and stuff and

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:51.480
there I've been so like object

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.420
relational theory is how like when you

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.090
come out as a baby

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.590
you're just like this you're in this

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.450
like weird schizoid state of like

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:01.800
everything's a blur and you're looking

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.320
around you're just like oh man I'm

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.570
[ __ ] hungry and then all sudden like

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:07.980
it just a nipple comes into your face

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.920
yeah whoa I can do that and like there's

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.930
like a theory that babies when they

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:14.310
first come out or they're just like

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.680
they're like omnipotent they think they

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.210
can just control everything they're like

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:19.770
man and someone wraps in a blanket

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:21.570
they're like [ __ ] yeah they slowly you

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:22.980
as the parent come into focus and

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.810
they're like what the [ __ ] is this guy

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:26.790
and like then they're depending on your

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:29.040
facial expressions that's how they learn

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.390
how to like interact with the world so

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.280
if you're like Jesus Christ shut up and

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:32.940
put him down

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.100
babies will start putting they'll start

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.300
picking up on that and they'll start

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.490
putting out what's its called a like a

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:39.750
fault there's a false and true self

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:40.530
being a [ __ ]

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.630
it's a false self so a baby will start

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.310
recognizing like if I cry too much they

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:46.530
won't pick me up so from a young age you

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:48.150
can start projecting a fake personality

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:49.290
that you just carry through your whole

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:50.610
life in order to please your parents and

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:50.860
you just

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:51.880
Carrie I didn't like all your

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.710
relationships your life it's [ __ ]

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:55.420
frightening dude I mean it makes sense

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.190
but there's these things can happen when

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.450
you're so young that you're not even

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.250
conscious of it and you just come the

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:06.730
next year forty and it's like a dollar

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:10.720
more an hour yeah it's [ __ ] I've been

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.750
getting into that about like like the

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.130
whole thing about when you're a kid like

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.690
the different ways that your parents

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:18.730
treat you or different attachment styles

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:19.960
and that's like different types of

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.750
personalities or strictly kin are

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.310
thought to be based on the way your

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:26.470
parents dealt with you as like a [ __ ]

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:29.980
infant to about two-year-old damn so

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.140
it's like astrology no but it's pretty

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.550
it's like would they they've done

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.440
studies with like like like the Russian

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.910
orphans and [ __ ] where like these kids

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.860
if you if you babies born and no one

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.210
like picks it up and like holds it for

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.950
the first like three months they you

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:44.650
become like like low IQ it [ __ ] you up

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.780
yeah it literally [ __ ] you up so if

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.860
like those there's probably definitely

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.600
nuances to like how you're being held

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.530
and interacted with

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.470

who listens to Cypress Hill there's

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.780

that's life stop thinking that's [ __ ]

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.550
oil it's basically how my brain works

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.430
24/7 yeah I've seen my cars get booted

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:35.840

about let's have it I was just listening

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:41.900
and anybody listens this listen to Dan

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:47.690
Carlin again imagine hardcore history he

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:50.060
has a new thing called addendums mm-hmm

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:51.500
they're like one-hour episodes cuz

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.540
that's perfect yeah they're awesome this

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:58.010
one's about the USS Indianapolis which

00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:59.750
was where that float around that was in

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.860
the Pacific in World War 2 it delivered

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:07.550
parts for the atom bomb so it delivered

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:09.890
parts for the bomb that hit here at

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:12.320
Hiroshima and it was like a secret

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.750
mission it naturally yeah so there's

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:17.990
like 1,100 dudes on this [ __ ] ship

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:20.869
holy [ __ ] which is atom bomb parts yeah

00:45:20.869 --> 00:45:22.490
they bring it to the island they're on

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:25.670
their way back like I think it was east

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:28.220
of the Philippines and they got

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.750
torpedoed in the middle of the night

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.570
fair enough Maru you imagine the dudes

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:37.040
on that ship so that would have been

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.510
like our great-grandfather's

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:40.850
just on a boat and they're like what do

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:42.200
we what are we bringing out here know

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.090
like I don't know man there's bombs are

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:46.340
supposed to good what was it basically

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.020
grandfather right okay these guys were

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:53.030
like 29 right what year is that 1945

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.380
[ __ ] yeah it would've been my

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.090
grandfather yeah yeah nine they're born

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:59.840
1918 the yeah that would uh yeah imagine

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.070
those dudes on there just being like

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:02.750
transporting atom bombs and Mick what's

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:04.490
that they're just like no idea I'd

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:08.060
[ __ ] these big bombs apparently [ __ ]

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.160
some people up at these dude apparently

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.540
like stronger than a lot of other bombs

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.130
and they use this [ __ ] basically me

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:17.630
talking about weird mean I guarantee

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:19.220
that most people on the ship didn't know

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.780
what an atom was of course not

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.510
so it was like magic they're driving

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:25.580
they're like we just deliver magic to

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.380
this island it's gonna eviscerate a city

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:32.440
but uh that's nothing I mean start to

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.759
finish this thing is the biggest

00:46:33.759 --> 00:46:35.380
nightmare of all time

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.539
yeah sure you were saying you could so

00:46:37.539 --> 00:46:39.579
horrible set up start to finish so

00:46:39.579 --> 00:46:41.859
they're in the Pacific they get torpedo

00:46:41.859 --> 00:46:43.390
in the middle of the night so everyone's

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:46.269
sleeping you wake up to a [ __ ] the

00:46:46.269 --> 00:46:48.579
ship sinking the ship sank in 12 minutes

00:46:48.579 --> 00:46:49.839
did they like that the torpedoes the

00:46:49.839 --> 00:46:52.029
Japanese to strap a dude unnecessarily

00:46:52.029 --> 00:46:56.650
to the to do that they had suicide

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:59.289
bombing torpedoes that would have just a

00:46:59.289 --> 00:47:01.449
dude on it yeah no I did that was

00:47:01.449 --> 00:47:08.079

and meanwhile atom bomb parts are just

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:31.930
floating to the bottom of sea

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:34.150
it was on the way back they delivered it

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:37.150

00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:51.850
bombs so then they go doing those atom

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:52.900
ah we're bringing them to bomb Japan

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:56.110
yeah yeah they're delivering the parts

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:57.850
to bomb them oh my god

00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:00.580
so that submarines hit him on the wrong

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:06.760
part yeah we got delivered it but uh so

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.800
they're burning alive the people that

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.670
survived that I think 300 people died

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:14.530
pretty much right away first like 15

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:17.020
minutes so now there's like 900 dudes

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.780
just in the water and that's when the

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.780
shark feeding frenzy starts for three

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:27.010
days god three days oh and it started

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:29.080
out with the sharks would eat like

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.690
carcasses and then they got tired of

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:33.280
that and started eating dudes that were

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.500
like wounded and stragglers cuz they all

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.900
went into different groups mm-hmm that

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.060
were spread out over all they made on a

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:41.440
piece of wood or something is floating

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.360
some had rafts but yet most of them had

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.650
life vests and you're just floating and

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:49.090
one thing Carlin was talking about was

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:50.770
how like it's not like the north where

00:52:50.770 --> 00:52:53.950

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.610
like your friends just sleeping and then

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:08.830
you go to touch him and he floats up and

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:10.380
his whole lower half is gone

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:12.420

separated yourself from the group like

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.010
people would kill themselves just by

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:33.150

that's actually badly is an American

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.760
tradition your thought process it is

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.590
sadly that is the only thing that

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:41.990
actually gets gets results heads

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:45.800

like if you start hitting them like

01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:48.830
that's the one thing they fear they can

01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:51.560
advocate violence and then also go eat

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.930

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:56.839
burgers is the official fuel violence

01:03:56.839 --> 01:03:59.819
[ __ ] you can't be like go attack and

01:03:59.819 --> 01:04:02.220
then you're like it's what all create

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:04.140

01:04:08.819 --> 01:04:10.680
oh [ __ ] so you guys were taking this

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:15.510
seriously I wrote that book but is it

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:16.589
true they're like we needed it's like

01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:19.230
well historically speak anything Marx

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:21.599
felt like that first you wrote that boys

01:04:21.599 --> 01:04:23.700
act oh [ __ ] he's like I was just [ __ ]

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:28.619
should have kept that one to myself oh

01:04:28.619 --> 01:04:31.109
you know he was like they all I've read

01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:33.480
a lot of that Marcus stuff now and it's

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.010
like it's really you read it and it's

01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:36.779
like easy to read yeah like this is

01:04:36.779 --> 01:04:38.579
really nice and then like there's a

01:04:38.579 --> 01:04:40.019
couple lines in there it's like yeah we

01:04:40.019 --> 01:04:41.609
have them some people like [ __ ] yeah we

01:04:41.609 --> 01:04:43.079
got to take this by force and he was

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:46.650
like oh [ __ ] no no and so on Ukrainian

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:48.359
farmers getting his [ __ ] head cut off

01:04:48.359 --> 01:04:52.369
yes too much we wrote a book in Germany

01:04:52.369 --> 01:04:54.569
20 years later guys getting his head cut

01:04:54.569 --> 01:04:59.760
off obviously didn't get eaten by sharks

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.740
in the Pacific you know yeah nice

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:04.440
[ __ ] run with this farm and then some

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.720
Soviets showed up some dude I got Lee's

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.859
price um probably told him about the

01:05:07.859 --> 01:05:09.779
book he's like yeah [ __ ] that dude that

01:05:09.779 --> 01:05:12.299
books not gonna affect us oh yeah dude

01:05:12.299 --> 01:05:15.119
that's uh yeah that's I mean dude I'm

01:05:15.119 --> 01:05:16.470
telling you that's gonna be the that's

01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:18.200
gonna be the main point of contention in

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:23.519
the next like I'd say the next 10 to 25

01:05:23.519 --> 01:05:25.200
years we'll be dealing with like hard

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.660
right hard left looks like a party to

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:29.069
full your word I think that I think

01:05:29.069 --> 01:05:30.599
that's just a natural lifespan of a

01:05:30.599 --> 01:05:33.599
democracy just totally split and

01:05:33.599 --> 01:05:35.579
polarizing oh no we'll get one of the

01:05:35.579 --> 01:05:37.829
other splits and polarizes and you catch

01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:39.779
one of the other we're on we're on like

01:05:39.779 --> 01:05:41.400
the fall the world the Roman temple

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:45.210
where like totally coming no no is but I

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:48.329
mean we are going at such a fast pace

01:05:48.329 --> 01:05:50.460
yeah like with the internet and all this

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.380
[ __ ] that like if you look at anything

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.420
historically compared to how quick an

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.869
empire can collapse you got to kind of

01:05:56.869 --> 01:05:59.670
compound that by a lot by the way just

01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:02.160
information gets shared and yeah you

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.900
know I mean well the other thing too is

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.309
that don't make any sense I know I know

01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:06.539
you're talking about the other thing is

01:06:06.539 --> 01:06:09.390
the UH I watch it all day with people

01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:10.119
like with

01:06:10.119 --> 01:06:13.660
the fact arguing it's like we're not

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.640
factual creatures we're not like if

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.079
you're like well here's get these

01:06:17.079 --> 01:06:18.670
statistics on this it's like we're all

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:21.579
going pure emotions yeah argued with my

01:06:21.579 --> 01:06:23.319
girlfriend it's 2-2 that's that's the

01:09:11.529 --> 01:09:14.259
that moms aren't down with that no if

01:09:14.259 --> 01:09:15.940
you have a regular family in a normal

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:17.319
life you don't want to hear some dude be

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.849
like nothing matters

01:09:18.849 --> 01:09:20.559
it's not even nothing matters it's just

01:09:20.559 --> 01:09:23.859
like I'm trying to think of how to

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:25.509
explain it it's just just to hit your

01:09:25.509 --> 01:09:28.119
mom with like like we're not the only

01:09:28.119 --> 01:09:30.009
reason you think we are so special human

01:09:30.009 --> 01:09:31.499
being says you were raised in like a

01:09:31.499 --> 01:09:33.519
judeo-christian background there's other

01:09:33.519 --> 01:09:35.049
parts the world I'd like don't look at

01:09:35.049 --> 01:09:37.779
us like in Chinese paintings some of the

01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:39.759
some of their art is like they'll have a

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:41.289
picture of a dude and he's just

01:09:41.289 --> 01:09:43.119
completely in eats like a Where's Waldo

01:09:43.119 --> 01:09:44.289
where you're looking like a wilderness

01:09:44.289 --> 01:09:45.849
singer oh there's a dude button like

01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:47.769
European paintings it's like a dude and

01:09:47.769 --> 01:09:49.539
like a guy's West and it's like straight

01:09:49.539 --> 01:09:52.480
up on them but that's not all Chinese

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.769
paintings but if I if you start hitting

01:09:53.769 --> 01:09:54.880
your mom with that well you know you

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.800
think like you're very like human center

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.659
cuz you're good sucks yeah it's a [ __ ]

01:09:58.659 --> 01:10:00.130
up thing to think about if I was if you

01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:01.449
hit your mom with that have you already

01:10:01.449 --> 01:10:03.369
made it 60 years you've got your own

01:10:03.369 --> 01:10:04.869
confusions then you get hit with like

01:10:04.869 --> 01:10:07.329
wait my whole [ __ ] life space awful

01:10:07.329 --> 01:10:08.650
eyes like not alive but you know you

01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:09.880
have this weird filter you look through

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.989
the world and if you're others like this

01:10:10.989 --> 01:10:12.249
and pull it on them they're just like oh

01:10:12.249 --> 01:10:14.499
god all right what's your son comes into

01:10:14.499 --> 01:10:18.070
there dude sure sure this is me going to

01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:20.590
a 23 year old party it's your mom sit

01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:22.900
there be like yeah all right dude yeah I

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.249
remember when I thought that in the

01:10:24.249 --> 01:10:27.429
[ __ ] 70s just wait you [ __ ] you

01:10:27.429 --> 01:10:28.929
grow up a little I

01:10:28.929 --> 01:10:30.790
I don't know I know I know I want known

01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:32.350
I really do wonder about that I think at

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:33.670
one point your brain just goes like

01:10:33.670 --> 01:10:36.670
blocks out all unnecessary [ __ ] so it's

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:39.790
like yeah I the thing to me is just

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:42.520
people are animals we're confused we run

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.190
off emotions we're trying to have sex

01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:47.380
and multiply and we figured out how to

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:48.520
kind of be nice to each other

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.489
sometimes and it's like we're [ __ ] up

01:10:51.489 --> 01:10:53.320
you have real [ __ ] up that's a

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.179
distress people we're real [ __ ] up

01:10:55.179 --> 01:10:58.600
yeah JP it's true though of course

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.760
we're totally irrational and [ __ ] up

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.290
and half of what we're doing we don't

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:04.570
know why yeah by small things you like

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:06.969

01:11:06.969 --> 01:11:09.960

fact that we were just kind of like just

01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:59.710

01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:01.659

to us and they're just like so I had a

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:07.630

the wolf is [ __ ] though that's horrible

01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:17.650
it was about it was a zoo in Holland

01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:19.960
they kept wolves and bears in an

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.530
enclosure

01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:22.660
I mean imagine how nude together for a

01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.820
while and then the Bears finally ripped

01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:28.300
apart these wolves it's [ __ ] up it's

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.830
[ __ ] up too because imagine just like

01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:31.840
the Joe Rogan brain the flow tank dude

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.420
it's gotta be [ __ ] terrifying Joe

01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.280
Rogan's thoughts plug into the go to the

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.840
next flow tank next to him and plug the

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.250
matrix thing into your head while he's

01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:40.630
in there or just be like it's just

01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:42.220
nothing but [ __ ] like the circle of

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.920
life in the food chain they hit him with

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.210
that during that thing they're like well

01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:47.470
you just kind of recently started

01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:49.270
smoking weed right that's so funny

01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:51.850
yeah no yes I started when I was thirty

01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:53.470
it's like yeah that's why you're getting

01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:55.549
these eighth grade thoughts now

01:14:55.549 --> 01:14:58.699
that's my thought Brogan with his like

01:14:58.699 --> 01:15:01.729
yeah there's his like first Netflix

01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:04.819
special the one that he put out way

01:15:04.819 --> 01:15:06.769
before Netflix was even a thing yeah

01:15:06.769 --> 01:15:08.869
which is pretty incredible yeah he's

01:15:08.869 --> 01:15:10.219
been on the [ __ ] cutting edge when

01:15:10.219 --> 01:15:11.719
you know he ordered like a bunch of DMT

01:15:11.719 --> 01:15:13.639
off the off the internet like a long

01:15:13.639 --> 01:15:15.649
time ago yeah you know what it was and

01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:19.189
smoked it yeah he's [ __ ] the fact

01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:21.169
that he he didn't f look special a long

01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:23.209
time ago in the beginning he's in a limo

01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:24.649
I think I've talked about it he's a limo

01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:25.819
on the way to the show and he's like

01:15:25.819 --> 01:15:27.679
we're just a virus on this planet man

01:15:27.679 --> 01:15:30.379
dude bro you are a [ __ ]

01:15:30.379 --> 01:15:32.510
eighth-graders smoking weed yeah man he

01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:35.899
got weed shiny hat one of his specials

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:37.699
was him like we should just drop weed on

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:38.479
the Middle East

01:15:38.479 --> 01:15:39.739
it was just like I've ever seen it mean

01:15:39.739 --> 01:15:44.419
like smhd I was like 22 borrowin dude

01:15:44.419 --> 01:15:47.149
this is not gonna help you live at the

01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:49.879
time being like goddamn like I had a

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:51.589
[ __ ] solid decade of smoking weed

01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:52.969
under my belt at this point I was like

01:15:52.969 --> 01:15:54.169
dude this guy just started [ __ ]

01:15:54.169 --> 01:15:55.819
smoking weed or something do when you

01:15:55.819 --> 01:15:57.679
first start smoking weed I remember for

01:15:57.679 --> 01:15:59.359
the first like two weeks like you look

01:15:59.359 --> 01:16:00.649
at everything like I could probably

01:16:00.649 --> 01:16:02.389
smoke weed oh that man I can't wait to

01:16:02.389 --> 01:16:05.179
smoke weed again damn no sick thing I

01:16:05.179 --> 01:16:08.149
thought it's so funny yeah that we

01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:10.909
thought process is very different yeah

01:16:10.909 --> 01:16:12.589
like totally different stoner brained

01:16:12.589 --> 01:16:14.539
stoner brain f it feels like you're

01:16:14.539 --> 01:16:16.699
somebody else he's offered from totally

01:16:16.699 --> 01:16:17.989
different thoughts than I'm ever

01:16:17.989 --> 01:16:20.209
normally having I suffered from what's

01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:22.429
weird decade of stoner like a decade of

01:16:22.429 --> 01:16:24.379
heavy stoner brain what do you think

01:16:24.379 --> 01:16:27.079
evil hippies have they get out of it

01:16:27.079 --> 01:16:28.939
stoner brain is more like we're gonna

01:16:28.939 --> 01:16:30.679
start taking advantage of people exactly

01:16:30.679 --> 01:16:33.439
they get a bad mix of stoner brain with

01:16:33.439 --> 01:16:35.719
dark ambition and it's like [ __ ]

01:16:35.719 --> 01:16:39.789
terrifying dude just like I really

01:16:40.269 --> 01:16:43.519
wasn't evil every time I see if it makes

01:16:43.519 --> 01:16:47.089
you laugh people say that try to explain

01:16:47.089 --> 01:16:48.649
why they're not evil hippies is the

01:16:48.649 --> 01:16:49.969
funniest thing because you can't

01:16:49.969 --> 01:16:52.039
successfully explain what honey Libby

01:16:52.039 --> 01:16:54.229
you just can't if you're like no I'm not

01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:56.059
and here's why it's like juillet you

01:16:56.059 --> 01:16:59.439
trying to manipulate my phone right now

01:16:59.649 --> 01:17:04.530
alright where we have our and 16 nice

01:17:04.530 --> 01:17:06.270
wrap it they say to do anything else you

01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:09.030
want to [ __ ] know man [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:11.159
show I've just been I'm telling you I've

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:12.840
just been in the [ __ ] way the dowel

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.880
dude yeah wouldn't it be late in the

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.639
universe that's pretty tight no I just

01:17:17.639 --> 01:17:19.530
been trying not to spaz really [ __ ]

01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:21.570
just driving it's like it is weird when

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:24.719
you can I did it for like I'd say 40% of

01:17:24.719 --> 01:17:26.520
today and after a while you start

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.099
feeling like you're [ __ ] not tripping

01:17:29.099 --> 01:17:30.539
but you start feeling weird you're just

01:17:30.539 --> 01:17:32.010
like god I feel like a [ __ ] nutcase

01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:34.170
really imagine doing that like these

01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:36.300
guys who like the Masters of it

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.559
we're just live in the mountains by

01:17:37.559 --> 01:17:39.119
themselves in China and just these dudes

01:17:39.119 --> 01:17:41.520
who'd be in the present moment for 60

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:43.260
years by the time if you do that and can

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.059
pound that for year after year you must

01:17:45.059 --> 01:17:47.489
go it must be crazy India versus black

01:17:47.489 --> 01:17:50.219
all your weird nervous system thoughts

01:17:50.219 --> 01:17:51.780
you're there they're done you don't like

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:54.170
you like yeah I'm grieving weird I feel

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:56.969
all that's out and you times that by 15

01:17:56.969 --> 01:17:58.559
years it's like who the [ __ ] knows what

01:17:58.559 --> 01:18:00.329
happens in your brain wild I think your

01:18:00.329 --> 01:18:01.559
brain will rewire itself if you keep

01:18:01.559 --> 01:18:03.239
doing it on and you just become this

01:18:03.239 --> 01:18:05.250
like that's why what someone comes out

01:18:05.250 --> 01:18:06.719
the mers like watch it they're so quick

01:18:06.719 --> 01:18:10.039
no distracting

01:18:10.159 --> 01:18:13.590
here's another Carlin thought this is

01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:17.250
somebody's brain going nuts in World War

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:19.679
one in that hardcore history he talks

01:18:19.679 --> 01:18:21.989
about this dude at the Somme I think

01:18:21.989 --> 01:18:24.300
where the mud was so [ __ ] up that he

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.090
got buried waist-deep or like up to his

01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:28.380
like stomach and they couldn't get him

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:30.630
out oh so like they did these guys just

01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:32.159
marched past him he was up to his

01:18:32.159 --> 01:18:34.230
stomach and he was like help I think we

01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:35.760
can't it'll kill you yeah I can't help

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.090
you no matter what you're stuck so then

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:40.739
they said a day later they were marching

01:18:40.739 --> 01:18:43.619
back and now it was up to his neck oh it

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:45.929
was just his head he lost he lost his

01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:49.940
mind so it's just a head in the ground

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:54.819
[Music]

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:02.849
well off his [ __ ] inside of his face

01:19:02.849 --> 01:19:05.670
sorry man I missed I'm yet someone who

01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:07.139
