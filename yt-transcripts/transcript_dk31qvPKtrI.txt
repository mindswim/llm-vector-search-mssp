paraplegic from i think he's got whacked

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.520
by a car

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.080
like he was like [ __ ] up dude there

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.919
was a player from penn state who got

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.160
paralyzed against ohio state and then

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.919
they he they were like he'll never walk

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:18.880
again and then he

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.560
ran the team out of the tunnel the next

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.639
season or like two seasons

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.639
but uh they played miami that day and

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.240
just got beat by like 50.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.759
so they had this like real inspirational

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.520
moment of him running out

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.759
and then the you just [ __ ] him up fun

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.000
times at least he still could play

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.440
he couldn't he couldn't play he sucked

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.039
he could barely no he couldn't so he he

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:37.520
kind of

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.080
like he hobbled out he i thought he like

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.280
played and got snatched

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.880
give him a [ __ ] break dude he did he

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.319
used to play he was pretty good so he

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:44.880
did he just

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.880
came in with his head down against ohio

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.160
state and then he rooted yeah and then

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.039
he led the team

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.759
more radio-esque more of a radio because

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:52.560
rudy could play

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.520
true so they were like we'll get up by

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.360
like 40 and then put him in at the end

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.479
and like everyone will hoist him on his

00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:58.960
shoulders

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.800
no no no there was no even no no no

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.000
there was no he didn't play

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.840
again he he led the team out the next

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.160
season so he walked just jogging out i

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.280
got yeah

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.880
he couldn't he wasn't in pads there was

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.400
a miracle but it was a miracle but then

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.759
they got [ __ ] up and they got crushed

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.080
so it kind of ruined the yeah especially

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.599
because then you re-watch it and he like

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:16.000
hobbles

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.919
out [ __ ] up yeah and then they just

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:19.360
get smoked

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.800
anyway yeah that's kind of [ __ ] up on

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.319
his teammates to lose that one for him

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:22.720
yeah

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.160
i'd have fought extra hard you have to

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.759
fight it out dude if they

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.400
if you got [ __ ] hobbled up be

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.919
podcasting my ass off dude just a

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:32.240
[ __ ]

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.759
um view hawkins doubt and i had to do

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:36.800
this whole thing i

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.000
i would never lose dude

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.840
he's dead right black people are lazy

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.319
um man but yeah there's sick native

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.919
american facts now he got me fired up

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:52.400
would you

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.560
get fired up uh also common

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.759
misconception that they had cool names

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:59.599
don't take that from me bro you know

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:01.120
they do have some cool names like

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.039
cr crazy horse [ __ ] like that there was

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:04.800
also guys like peanuts

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.360
and stink an erection that never goes

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.160
down

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.759
that's actually pretty cool there's one

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.759
lady this white lady had

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:14.560
she got taken and then she had two three

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.919
kids and their names were like their

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:18.720
names their names were stink and peanut

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.800
they were like here's my awesome warrior

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.160
stink

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.479
and his brother peanuts it makes sense

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:25.840
though they would have like white trash

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.560
nicknames

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.800
yeah because yeah they basically you got

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.000
like rocker park named

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.199
did you really you know what i mean like

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:32.399
they would just give you a name you do

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.479
something wild and then just name you

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:36.399
like some lady got abducted and then had

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:37.760
diarrhea the whole way

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.159
because they fed her like buffalo like

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.519
raw they gave her like a buffalo it was

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:42.560
like heart

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.080
to eat to munch on during the journey

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.680
and she just diarrhea the whole way

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.399
so her name was like diarrhea that makes

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.600
sense

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.040
yeah i don't think they were working

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.040
with like a robust vocabulary either

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.040
no so it was it was just like crazy

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.080
horse stink

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.320
fart boner he was just like one it was

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.279

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.360
irish and being like john

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.959
for real yeah there's like five names

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.040
there's five names there's boner

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.880
diarrhea and then you were the chief and

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.080
you're like all right uh i called

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.959

00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:14.399
super crazy man horse i'm thunder cat

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.240

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.480
uh so apparently the inside of your nose

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.600
is made out of

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.200
dicks it's the same type of skin as your

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.600
dick so it expands and contracts with

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.880
like when you're aroused that's why

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.279
women's typically their their nasal

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:41.920
their uh

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.920
nostrils flare if they get if a woman

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.200
gets like kind of turned on her nose

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:45.760
goes

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.320
exactly dude stop dude [ __ ] dude

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.360
you're gonna get a boner if you keep

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.160
doing that

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.760
it's made out of it's literally made out

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.680
of dick skin so your nose like

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.399
contracts and expands with your arousal

00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:58.240
is your nose made out of cartilage

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.519
i'm talking about the inner the inner

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:01.760
stuff

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.760
it's the same type of material as

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.959
distance what are your eyelids made out

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:06.800
of that feels like dick's skin

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.399

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.519
i also every now and again i put my

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.519
finger up before before the podcast matt

that's a [ __ ] miracle that i brought

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.959
a miracle i believe you're right you're

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:40.240

yeah you'll feel it mine's marked in

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.120
just a push

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.079

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.680
doing a bunch of coke but we're not

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.720

i swear to god he's trying to secure my

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.640

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.399
just he tweeted yesterday was like bring

00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:40.559
back college football i was like

00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:42.720
this is my guy that's the only policy i

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.159
care about he's like i'll probably give

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:45.519
a speech down to gettysburg i was like

00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:48.320
who is this guy

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.679
yeah apparently there's uh he was like

00:31:51.679 --> 00:31:53.360
god damn it trying to make people pay

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.519
uh like generic prices for the covet

00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:56.480
thing

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.080
really yeah he apparently that's what

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.080
i've heard the pharmaceutical

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.279
companies are mad at him because he was

00:32:01.279 --> 00:32:03.679
like if if uh when when a vaccine comes

00:32:03.679 --> 00:32:05.039
out people are just paying generic

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:06.000
prices

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.360
and apparent that's a weird thing for

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.080
the left half to be like well

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.919
apparently some of the argumentation's

00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:13.919
been like but we need big pharma to get

00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:15.440
us out of this we can't turn our backs

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.120
on them now and it's like

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.679
okay it's weird god they have to they

00:32:19.679 --> 00:32:20.799
have to disagree

00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:23.440
it's funny man yeah crazy but apparently

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.640
either side can never be like well they

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.279
got that right

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:27.360
well russia says they got the vaccine

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.399
russia has it

00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:29.760
they secured the bag good for them

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.120
russia he's like i get putin's like i

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.440
gave it to my daughter she's fine

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.760
she got a couple fevers broke them she's

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.360
like we're available

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.399
the vaccine will be available

00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:39.919
immediately that's a good move they're

00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:41.600
just gonna sell us robitussin

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.000
yeah who sells like 18 billion dollars

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.440
worth of [ __ ] nothing

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.519
yeah i mean it's like how are you going

00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:48.880
to test it

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.720
like the vaccines were like it's working

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.080
it's like yeah i guess

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.880
cool i can go back to stuff now dude i

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.600
was uh

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.000
i was reading about china in the

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.440
atlantic

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.279
and you know i called it you read that

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:03.360
liberation spud was saying

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.480
purely propaganda the atlantic he was

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:06.960
saying

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.880
it's purely some of it professional

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.399
class pro there's levels of propaganda

00:33:10.399 --> 00:33:11.760
there's professional class propaganda

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.880
which has to be like

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.480
use kind of like big words and you mess

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.919
around with kind of like more ideas and

00:33:15.919 --> 00:33:17.360
it's not as like blatant

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.640
but i'm reading the first two articles

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.159
the first two articles are like that you

00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:21.120
know

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.600
um just like they'll sound like fox news

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.960
propaganda where it's like does this

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.440
[ __ ]

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.159
hate freedom

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:31.760
coming up next do arabs hate baseball

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.799
we'll find out

00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:35.919
probably but yeah they uh yeah it's like

00:33:35.919 --> 00:33:36.960
they'll

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.559
because i was reading it being like dude

00:33:38.559 --> 00:33:40.559
this sounds it's like the big thing

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:41.600
right now in the atlantic and i guess

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.120
like an elite circles is like america's

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.519
done

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:45.279
america's this everybody loves saying

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:47.120
that this has brought america to its

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.159
knees and then like

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:49.519
some lady will write an article that's

00:33:49.519 --> 00:33:51.279
like in the grotesque

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:53.360
mirror of racism that emanates off of

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.880
donald trump and then actually there's

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.320
two articles of like

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.519
you know the rip and that stuff i'm

00:33:57.519 --> 00:33:59.279
reading it being like all right and then

00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:01.039
it gets into this article about china

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.720
and it was just like you know people are

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.000
talking about the economies down this

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:04.559
net

00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:06.240
and they're talking about china's um how

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.760
they're like they're working on their ai

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.800
stuff and they're saying how they

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.480
developed it on the uyghurs

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.200
like they they tested every time they

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.000
they tested the

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.119
like homo sapiens the weaker yeah is

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:18.480
that how do you even say that

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.599
i don't know i think it is a whole

00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:21.520
eagers and the uh

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.300
you know that you know

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.639
[Laughter]

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:26.720
[ __ ] they're saying doper's in the

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.560
back dude like a yeah

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.440
it's a shooting gallery dude

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.359
[Laughter]

00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:34.560
so they're saying they tested this

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.520
technology on the uyghurs and uh

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.520
really so they're they have them where

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.720
he was like damn what the [ __ ] is this

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.879
[ __ ]

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.480
so they they like make them they have

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.520
like an app on their phone

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.879
like they log you know according this

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:50.480
article they're saying like they log how

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.760
much you're on

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.159
say like fox news was mandatory so it's

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.599
like state propaganda and if you're not

00:34:55.599 --> 00:34:56.879
looking at enough of it they'll call you

00:34:56.879 --> 00:34:57.920
and be like

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.440
what's up do you think the uyghurs talk

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.200
like like ti

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.880
you think they like you need to get us

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.920
the vaccination

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:09.440
sorry they're excited about that word

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.240
i don't think they would take the

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.640
vaccine the uyghurs nah they're muslim

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.800
brother they're not taking that [ __ ]

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.359
true so so they have apparently they're

00:35:17.359 --> 00:35:18.960
around these guys according to me why do

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.560
you think muslims don't think vaccines

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.440
they don't [ __ ] with that

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.359
like a hardcore mugs they're not taking

00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:25.760
a vaccine why they love science

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.520
they invented it bro have some respect

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.079
the wiggers invented math and science

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:32.240
dude that hugh eagers are not definitely

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.240
not [ __ ] with vaccines dude

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.200
i don't think they're gonna get that

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.400
first of all they're just gonna try to

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.920
let the uyghurs die

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.119
like they're so apparently so they have

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:42.640
a program you know again allegedly

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.520
because i don't live in china i don't

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.640
know but

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.320
it seems plausible that they have like

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.680
fully detained these guys and they're

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.760
doing like these like uh

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.839
they're trying to like re-educate them

00:35:51.839 --> 00:35:53.680
and make them like fully chinese

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.040
but what they said was is they'll give

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.480
you they have big brothers and big

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.680
sisters how do they make them

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.680
fully chinese i don't know they go to a

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.200
chinese school and you have to like

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.400
fully learn how to be chinese i don't

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.079
know they have like driver's ed

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.960
parallel park come on now

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.520

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.320
yeah

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.680
we might as well get it in while we can

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.720
because i'm reading this article and

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.920
apparently they're gonna cut they're

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.359
swooping down on us but dude they'll

00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:22.720
have a big brother

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.240

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.000
to like chinese school

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.040

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.320
if you're a big bro with a stick around

prima nocte yeah dude

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.760

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.280
dude in your house all the time

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.280

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.320
damn

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.320
just cooking but now that what they're

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.839
saying is they're developing all this ai

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:03.119
technology

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:04.400
where they're trying to get it down you

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.599
know they're not they're not there yet

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:07.359
it's actually kind of funny because like

00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:08.960
one of their they are in the future dude

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.119
that's like the future of porn

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:14.240
incest cockledry with big brother yeah

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.160
big brother government what's your wife

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.760
that's that's what we're talking about

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.240
probably hot actually yeah they got it's

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.920
like woman stuck in house because her

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.920

purely on the perfect porn well right

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.920
now i think

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.359
that'll probably follow after the i

00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:34.880
think they're exporting like plug and

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.359
play

00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:37.520
uh autocratic like panopticons where

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.720
it's like you can see

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.640
everyone's movement you read you like

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.079
sell all the phones link them all in a

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:42.560
network

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.920
yeah they're trying to play sim city

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.359
they're playing but they're selling the

00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:47.040
ability to play

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.560
according to the article to autocratic

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.680
regimes from around the world so you

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.720
could have like north korea you can get

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.839
hooked up by china

00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:53.440
venezuela might get hooked up by china

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.119
where you're just they're like here you

00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:55.440
go

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.200
here's how you completely monitor your

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.839
entire uh you know civilian base

00:37:59.839 --> 00:38:02.720
then it'll be this is my prediction what

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.920
i think they're going for is it'll be

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.440
like north korea

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.040
um china venezuela any country that like

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.040
where a dictator can get this technology

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.480
and then then it'll just be up to the

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.720
west to be like well i guess we got to

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.560
fight this like autocratic regime where

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.000
like you can just demand all the data

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.599
the more data you have the better your

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:21.359
ai gets so i think the west is going to

00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:22.240
be like

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.240
look let's just give up everyone's data

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.839
in the name of freedom and it'll just be

00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:26.880
the same thing yeah

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.480
so i think that's i think it's almost

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.400
unavoidable right now

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.680
just at least the way they're reporting

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.839
it yeah

00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:35.599
i don't know i mean they're they're

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:37.040
talking like

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.960
facial recognition looking to like you

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.560
know looking at what you read looking

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.920
how you react to things well you know

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.240
again

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.599
they said they're right it's funny too

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:44.560
because they say all this stuff they're

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.000
like yeah but last year they had a thing

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:46.720
where like

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.000
they're like we can recognize everyone's

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.280
face in two seconds and then they're

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:49.839
like

00:38:49.839 --> 00:38:51.599
there was a thing where like a an ad

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:53.520
some face on like a bus got a ticket for

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.440
jaywalking

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.280
i like that yeah so i don't know dude

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.800
it's you're reading all these articles

00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.359
and it's like

00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:01.359
it's definitely like a black nurse well

00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:03.200
so the facial recognition

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.560
so i mean if it's an ad on a bus well

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.920
that what i'm telling you is the facial

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.119
recognition they're dealing with they're

00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:10.640
selling the [ __ ] like sub-saharan

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.520
regimes

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.440
and the facial recognition for black

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.960
faces is really bad

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.119
so like they're trying so for free we

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:18.560
might have to go all black face too

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.400
we might be we might have to braveheart

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.079
wow we might have to braveheart for

00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:23.760
freedom that's a nice twist that's

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.800
probably why they don't want us in

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.079
blackface dude

00:39:26.079 --> 00:39:28.160
government crackdown hard on blackface

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.920
lately exactly because the deep state

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:30.400
knows

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.400
deep state knows the only true way to

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.920
beat them is just go full

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.680
black face yeah they uh did ever

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.200
do you ever see that when like facebook

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.760
had trouble with it they they would tag

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.520
i think it was chris cotton r.i.p

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.200
every black person on facebook is like

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.720

that's not him so yeah the facial

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.000

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.160

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.200
was it just like sheer

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.280
laziness or was there like bedding

00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:49.839
devastatingly poor

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.800
because i don't get them yeah i don't

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.359
know

00:43:57.359 --> 00:43:58.880
well that was different the lady was

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.800
like how would a white man

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.640
ever know what a black woman's hair was

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.480
like if it was wetting in the ocean it's

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:04.800
like

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.920
well maybe he was in the ocean with her

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.319
maybe

00:44:08.319 --> 00:44:11.119
maybe maybe he saw it maybe he knows a

00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:12.640
black person they're like

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.160
shut up [ __ ] you mccusker you're the

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.000
[ __ ] worst there

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.400
it's like damn that that's a weird thing

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.000
to be like i'm not gonna write about

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.280
black people at all i wouldn't

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.560
in fact i quit writing all i can write

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.240
about is white people and [ __ ] them

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.680
that's a lot of like i mean

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.520
that's just probably for bad writers the

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.280
same way bad comics are like i'm an

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.960
activist now and that's pretty much

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.760
it yeah i mean dude like what big time

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:36.000
yeah

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.920
that's the move big time i noticed a lot

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.520
of the outrage

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.640
i mean i'm trying to i think i don't

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.839
know when it was but there was people

00:44:41.839 --> 00:44:42.880
who were like

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.480
freaking out maybe the snl thing i don't

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.680
know what it was but you you look at

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.200
their profile and it's always like oh no

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.560
by the way check out my

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.880
uh indie comic series about a black

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.240
superhero and it's like or

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.160
a kick-ass muslim lady who runs for the

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.760
white house and it's like

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.520
okay that's weird that's just [ __ ]

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.520
happening it happens to me you know

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.599
i mean it tails all this time bro it is

00:45:01.599 --> 00:45:02.640
it's unfortunate

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.640
it's weird too to see comics just fully

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.040
like like i just saw a political ad

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.359
for the democratic party the the dnc

00:45:09.359 --> 00:45:11.280
there maybe it was the dnc it was

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.760
paid for by somebody that was just a

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.119
david cross bit

00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:17.680
about how shitty trump is and they do

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:19.359
that's like a political ad now

00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:21.119
it's like how as a comic are you just

00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:22.640
like

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.560
it'd be like yeah i basically do

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.000
propaganda for one of the political

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.359
parties

00:45:27.359 --> 00:45:29.520
i don't know it's just cash it's odd

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.040
yeah dude they're after the cash have

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.440

comedians he would bury you because he's

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.160
significantly funnier

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.280
to just wear tight stuff right now yeah

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.720

yeah yeah man that's uh yeah golf

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.040
is easily the worst [ __ ] sport to

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.000
watch

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.599
regular season worse than baseball worst

00:58:01.599 --> 00:58:03.920
regular season baseball is rough

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.720
but yeah golf's number one golf is like

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.319
the best it can get is the worst of

00:58:08.319 --> 00:58:08.720
basically

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.240
what nba in the bubble has kind of

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.000
sucked especially because the sixers are

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:12.799
horrible dude

00:58:12.799 --> 00:58:14.319

00:58:24.319 --> 00:58:25.599
those european dudes do they have

00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:27.200

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:35.440
yeah man like someone there has to be

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.040
someone in the nba who rocks like an

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.960
american flag trump jersey

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.040

fire right now it will be so it'll be

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.400
pretty segregated if the if you sit

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.960
down yeah it'll definitely be fun no

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.160
it'll definitely that'll be a fun moment

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:30.640
for me

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.920
pretty split up you're gonna have to

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.240
invite like le meredith

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.079
trill on the group side just just like

01:03:36.079 --> 01:03:37.280
the yin and yang just yeah

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:42.079
little i got you it's a dot

01:03:43.039 --> 01:03:45.039
yeah they're planning like a color

01:03:45.039 --> 01:03:46.640
experience which would be funny like if

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:46.880
you

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.559
like if you invite like sydney or like

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:50.240
lemaire like when they walk in

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.920
whoever is at the door is gonna be like

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.160
no you're on that side for sure

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.559
just be like what for sure i don't know

01:03:56.559 --> 01:03:57.760
how you have no idea how they're even

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.559
gonna do that

01:03:58.559 --> 01:03:59.839
it probably will be something like that

01:03:59.839 --> 01:04:01.440
yeah it's all in one spot you're gonna

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.480
have to get

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.400
her side of the family to seat people

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.640
because that's tricky for honkies

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.559
if they get the wrong side figure it out

01:04:08.559 --> 01:04:09.839
yeah

01:04:09.839 --> 01:04:12.240

that's the only way you can handle that

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.720
rather than being sir like start like

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:26.000
