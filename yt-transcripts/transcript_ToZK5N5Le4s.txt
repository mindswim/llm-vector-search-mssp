Zoom it's a different uh it's a

00:09:52.079 --> 00:09:53.399

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:55.000
new waiting room is going to understand

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.399

electrical yeah I mean I really love

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.360
working at at McDonald's honestly it was

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.000
fun what were you doing uh mainly the

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.920
Nuggets but it was me and a bunch of

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.160
like 50-year-old Jamaican women who are

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.120
always high and like honestly when when

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.920
this when this virus first started uh

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.199
it's awesome and ever an Asian person

00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:16.759
would or I don't know I don't want to

00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:19.680
get Shane in trouble yeah yeah you can't

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.720
Shane's responsible for the attitudes of

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.639
all fast food workers not responsible

00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:25.440
for what the Jamaican women at my

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.399
McDonald's would do but whenever an

00:15:27.399 --> 00:15:29.120
Asian person would come in they would

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.920
not like hand they would not like take

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.000
the money from their hands they would

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.240
make them put the money on a tray and

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.759
like Slide the tray towards them damn

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:39.560
like they were not touching any Asian

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.040
people on this [ __ ] so they had the

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.600
McDonald's lock down tight from covid oh

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.920
yeah they were all super paranoid they

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.360
were on their [ __ ] that might be we

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.680
might need we might need a strict

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.519
Jamaican lady panel dude to lock this

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:53.720
thing I honestly think they could I

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.040
think the next uh what's that guy the

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.000
Surgeon General they should just take

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.920
Jinta from milkshakes and just make

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.360
her General that's a good call dude

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.759
that's a good call so you were strictly

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:10.040
on you were a nugget man I mean I would

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.680
work to register too but I mean I didn't

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.639
really you were the you were the uh the

00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:18.160
you were the plug for all the O good

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.079
boys yeah I mean give people extra [ __ ]

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:24.800
whenever I felt like they were nice

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.880
that's what's up you slide an extra nug

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.600
damn slide an extra nug slide an extra

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.360
hash Brown that's the easiest one is

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.440
just throw an extra hash brown on there

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.920
that's so but you would never know

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.079
though so you you're just you're just

00:16:35.079 --> 00:16:36.279
paying it forward like that like you're

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:37.720
dropping an extra nug or two in

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.920
somebody's thing and then they're just

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.480
going about their day lated like God

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.800
damn I got a couple extra pieces I mean

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.319
that's like when I when I get a thing

00:16:45.319 --> 00:16:47.959
from McDonald's I always count them and

00:16:47.959 --> 00:16:49.560
sometimes you get 21 like I feel like

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.639
I'm not the only one doing this no

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:54.040

way through it I tried watching it it

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.760
was crap you didn't miss anything it was

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.520
crap it was overrated dude everybody was

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.440
just I don't know it was a fad on the

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.800
internet so everyone was jerking off

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.640
yeah it was kind of that's annoying here

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.640
when like you would hear it's just a

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.680
Content thing I saw some podcast if what

00:45:09.839 --> 00:45:11.400
like there's nothing you can do because

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.119
it's the one so there's a lot there's a

00:45:13.119 --> 00:45:14.440

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.160
who's breeding them that's the beef and

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.680

to release them back yeah you just got

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.319

you hey man you know you're not the only

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.440
person that's Mediterranean Brazil and

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.280
loved her so we'll just keep it at that

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.839
means I want you it means I want you

00:48:26.839 --> 00:48:28.839
Brazilian Portuguese Sam what do you got

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:30.440
to say what do you gotta say bro I just

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.480
gota say man I've been uh reading a lot

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.880
into maccy lately man and I you think

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.079
he's right with the Corona

00:48:39.079 --> 00:48:41.880
virus you I don't know I go back and

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.800
forth because he kind of seems right

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.119
sometimes because like why why are all

00:48:46.119 --> 00:48:48.680
like all these diagnosises and people

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.119
that were GNA die anyway that might have

00:48:50.119 --> 00:48:52.880
gotten it being record as covid deaths

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.640
but

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.079
then yeah I think I think there's a

00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:58.079
pretty easy reason for something like

00:48:58.079 --> 00:49:00.440
that uh is rare to I think that's

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.359
probably slightly rare but it's also I

00:49:02.359 --> 00:49:04.400
mean States and hospitals are getting

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.960
federally funded so I mean the the more

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.520
deaths they have the more money they're

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.160
going to get yeah so if someone's dying

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.119
of you know a heart attack and they just

00:49:13.119 --> 00:49:14.559
happen to have

00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:17.280
covid sh it up to the [ __ ] Co they

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.559
beefed up the numbers though because

00:49:18.559 --> 00:49:21.000
it's like if they want to true if they

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.280
want true good statistics yeah why are

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.079
they going like anything that they it's

00:49:25.079 --> 00:49:26.839
not without even testing that they SU

00:49:26.839 --> 00:49:28.920
suspect could be covid they lump as

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.920
covid and that like almost doubled the

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.559
deaths it like increased the deaths in

00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:35.359
America astronomically yeah it just

00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:37.079
seems Seems it seems bizarre it's a

00:49:37.079 --> 00:49:38.720
strange it's a strange thing and I I you

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.559
know look I know someone who works at a

00:49:40.559 --> 00:49:41.799
hospital who told me that they were kind

00:49:41.799 --> 00:49:43.000
of being pressured to nurse who was

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:43.920
saying they're being well they didn't

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.319
tell me they tell my cousin said they

00:49:45.319 --> 00:49:47.400
were being pressured to like like oh

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.640
just Co that's Co like you don't know

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.839
and if it could in some potential realm

00:49:52.839 --> 00:49:55.240
be co co and they'll still get funded if

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.520
deaths or deaths if a hospital has tons

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.640
of death I guess like Co is like no no

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.839
no it's federally funded for covid

00:50:00.839 --> 00:50:03.359
Relief so you you think the real thing

00:50:03.359 --> 00:50:05.079
the real conspiracy is hospitals line

00:50:05.079 --> 00:50:07.160
just get like mad ventilators I I don't

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.720
think it's really a conspiracy but it's

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.280
just exactly what happens it happens

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.040
with like [ __ ] like any crime like

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.839
crimes will be over reported to get

00:50:16.839 --> 00:50:19.200
Federal funding to precincts it's just

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.319
it's just how these things operate yeah

00:50:21.319 --> 00:50:22.720
but that's weird this is a medical

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.319
statistic so it's like why would you be

00:50:24.319 --> 00:50:25.760
like well if you're at doubt just list

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.599
it as a covid death why why would they

00:50:27.599 --> 00:50:29.400
do that seems very statistically it

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.119
seems very dishonest and like that would

00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:34.400
muddle the data unbelievably yeah I mean

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.440
it's just a guess but that would be a

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.960
reason why they would do something like

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.799
that one more quick medical question I'm

00:50:39.799 --> 00:50:41.559
not saying they are true one more quick

00:50:41.559 --> 00:50:43.200
medical question the quarantine has kind

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.720
of turned me into a bit of a you know

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.440
partial alcoholic and I was curious as

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.960
how uh Shane how do you deal with your

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.680
hangovers what's the best cure to keep

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.799
drinking or like because there's always

00:50:51.799 --> 00:50:54.559
that day where you get hit with kind of

00:50:54.559 --> 00:50:57.720
the wall of drinking like like yeah I'm

00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.680
out for two days I still got to work I'm

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.280
professional man it's just how do you

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.520
deal with it all right so if you're if

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.400
you're yeah just I I don't know I

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.960
figured out lately if you just stop

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.119
drinking early like don't drink the

00:51:09.119 --> 00:51:10.720
whole night don't drink until you fall

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.000
asleep that's a major issue drink and

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.680
then stop drinking and drink uh you know

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.559
some water for like an hour or two

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:18.160
before you go try to like sober up

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.160
slightly before bed okay uh and then
