i mean let me tell you what's what i

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.960
love about the chains too it's a very

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.319
new thing in weightlifting by the way

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.600
they're made out of chocolate well it's

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.720
still no they're not that it's a very

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.160
new thing in weightlifting but they're

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.240
you don't need to use chains justin

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.080
they look [ __ ] awesome but here's why

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.600
the chains are good because as you go

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.120
down the weight comes off and then as

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.039
you go up the weight oh

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.000
you didn't understand that they're

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.199
they're hitting the floor so the weight

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.120
gets harder as you go up there but no

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.280
but that's not the chains are used for a

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.680
thousand things in weightlifting

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.880
you're putting them on because you think

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.880
you look awesome as [ __ ] one thousand

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.560
percent that is why i'm putting them on

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.759

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.519
best part of the video which is that

or thinking about nathan charles thing

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.360
and he i know he said he used to be in

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.640
that social justice warrior community um

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.559
it's like the fitness community yes it's

00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:32.159
a community like any other

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.600
it is a community but i couldn't have

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.480
sponsored i don't know if i don't know

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.080
if he told me in person or i i maybe i

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.200
thought it was his video but i thought

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.960
he mentioned just the word

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.799
i never explored that like safe space

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:43.279
comedy places what isn't that what we're

00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:46.159
doing yeah it is essentially but that's

00:32:46.159 --> 00:32:47.360
not what they mean when they use that

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.519
term and i just start i don't know why

00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:50.559
it hit me the other day thinking about

00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:52.480
that term like

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.480
anyone can get offended at anything so

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.360
much

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.440
that how could you possibly have a safe

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.279
space of anything if another human being

00:32:59.279 --> 00:33:00.960
is going to talk it's immediately not a

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.480
state because if they i said if someone

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.240
just goes in a safe space comedy place

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.440
nothing offensive that you think will be

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.880
offensive you just go

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.279
my mom uh my mom died of cancer and in

00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:10.320
some of the audience whose mother

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.320
currently has cancer like well knowing

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.080
that the [ __ ] safe space is doing

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.760
cancer jokes yeah that was a bad example

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.360
i don't think i think they would why not

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.320
if you if you're if you think you're

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.720
sharing a joke no not a joke if you're

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.880
sharing yourself dude this is this is a

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.840
safe

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.960
hold on a safe space joke is like uh

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.399
yadda yadda

00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:30.960
women get paid less than men

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.960
that's how the joke counts i understand

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.720
you just can't turn off the offensive

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.960
comedy yeah here's the statement they're

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.039
if you say you got divorced

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:48.000
do you know what i'm saying like no

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.200
because i don't know where where this

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.960
phrase was coined safe space comedy

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.240
spirit why don't oh yeah i've never

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.320
heard that let's say you go up to a safe

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.159
space comedy show and you do something

00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:58.080
as innocent as i'm raping your mom with

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.919
a nail gun and then there could always

00:33:59.919 --> 00:34:02.080
be someone in the audience you can't do

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.279
my mom was raped with a nail gun yeah

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:06.640
you do a joke about your grandmother

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.159
being gang raped by your grandfather and

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:09.040
a bunch of his friends and your

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.639
grandfather was the one that took here's

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.320
what it is everybody has their button

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.000
and once you talk about their thing then

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.200
they get offended what i'm saying but

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.000
their thing can be as bad as i agree

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.560
so what is the is there a clip of safe

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.399
space i actually asked bobby to pull up

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:23.599
things i'm curious to see if they have

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:25.919
any shows or footage of places like that

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:27.679
let's see bobby found something pretty

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.760
awesome uh also

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.599
uh attached to that but but first you

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:35.839
have comedy is a safe space

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.560
of the the women telling the things yeah

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.359
these are two women that put on a show

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:43.839
specifically uh picking out famous

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:46.079
comedians like terrible jokes what if i

00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:48.159
want a space that's safe from female

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.520
comedians

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.440
the the most i've found about the safe

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.960
space comedy is like called a good

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.200
showcase on a weekend am i right am i

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.520

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.960

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.240
right two more

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.200
and kill it there we go punctuated

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.440
it's like the lgbt community putting on

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.599
shows and and calling it's a a safe

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:09.920
space comedy place that's really mostly

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.599
what i found about like safe space

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:13.359
comedy shows but it's exactly so it's

00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:15.520
safe space to their ones yeah to their

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.760
things you won't hear that such a dumb

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.760
idea but in my search what a sheltered

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.880
way to live i found this uh video of

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.880
these two girls that put on a show

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.800
it's over two hours long it's very slow

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.200
but i think let's just watch it yeah

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.950
play the whole thing for two hours

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.400
[Laughter]

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.000
just really dig in

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.680
so uh yeah i just want to see the idea

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.200
so what you told me bobby what they do

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.880
is yeah that they

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.839
uh recite other comedians rape jokes is

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:44.720
all rape are just terrible jokes

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.480
they're offensive jokes with no context

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.839
no uh

00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:50.079
no delivery right oh [ __ ]

just saying the worst

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.599

awful it is that these

00:51:32.319 --> 00:51:35.040

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.240
point no they're not on that on this

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.160

00:51:48.319 --> 00:51:50.240
laugh at that there are points where

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.680
you're supposed to laugh throughout this

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.960
show but it better be at the right point

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:58.559
like it better be not when the rape joke

00:51:58.559 --> 00:52:00.640
jumps but you are there is a point where

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.960

because the push-ups community is

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.480
getting a lot bigger

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.319

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.720
i think his thing is that he's like

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.400
really angry about that you think his

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.640
thing close your eyes it's bill burr

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.400
one time she was watching a show it was

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.319
like some poor excuse for the view and

00:56:02.319 --> 00:56:03.680
they started talking about domestic

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.760
violence right for the nine millionth

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.359
time this year they're talking about

00:56:07.359 --> 00:56:09.200
domestic violence just in case you know

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.880
you didn't get the memo

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.200
evidently you know just some people

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.960
didn't get it it's not okay to slam your

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.400
wife's head into the cupboard drawers

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.000
because she didn't dry the can open off

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.839
properly you know

00:56:19.839 --> 00:56:22.000
it's gonna [ __ ] rust

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:22.880
how do you

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.040
how do you like not know to to not do

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.960

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.559
talking about it who was it like who

00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:31.440
wife peter's watching oh [ __ ]

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.119

00:56:33.119 --> 00:56:37.680
oopsy daisy sweetheart there you go

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.599
so

00:56:39.599 --> 00:56:41.119
at the end of the hour

00:56:41.119 --> 00:56:43.760
they come to the logical conclusion oh

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.319
there is no reason to hit a woman

00:56:46.319 --> 00:56:49.119
there is no reason to hit a woman

00:56:49.119 --> 00:56:50.480
and i was like

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.000
really

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
i could give you like 17 off the top of

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.599
my head yeah

00:56:55.599 --> 00:56:56.839
even

00:56:56.839 --> 00:56:58.960
hockey even in hockey

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.319
for instigating

00:57:00.319 --> 00:57:02.000
yeah yeah this is a good yeah

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.400
by the way even without still funny this

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.240
way here's here's right through this

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.280
joke

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.240
she's telling the joke without the joke

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.000
part it's still great she's just telling

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.240
it with the offensive setup which by the

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.720
way is what every good comedian will do

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.119
at some point will have a setup that

00:57:19.119 --> 00:57:21.200
would offend you and then the joke kind

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.960
of wins you over and she's telling it

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.359
without the joke part and it's still

00:57:25.359 --> 00:57:26.640
still fine good

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.799
it's still a good bit but it's the

00:57:28.799 --> 00:57:30.160
opposite point that she's making the

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.599
setup isn't even offensive it's like

00:57:31.599 --> 00:57:33.280
it's it's the sake it's not it's the

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.799
opposite of that the message she's

00:57:34.799 --> 00:57:36.319
sending me is she has great delivery for

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:38.319
rape jokes yeah

00:57:38.319 --> 00:57:39.680
i mean for real though they did do a

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.280
whole comedy show of rape joke like they

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.680

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.760

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.240

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:51.520

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.359

i'm sure yeah i'm just curious here what

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.680
it is like she said the first hour is

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.680
them reading rape jokes right and the

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.920
second hour is their comedy so let's

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.760
let's it's an hour

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.000
i don't know i just made that up this is

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.480
about a half hour 25 minutes all right

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.559
so let's jump to the end and see their

00:58:22.559 --> 00:58:24.960
rape jokes the end is them

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.720
doing a sit down with two other

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.319
comedians talking about the show that

00:58:28.319 --> 00:58:29.760
they just did

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.520
no no no it's not wouldn't it be great

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.520
if the end was just them doing rape

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.119
jokes i'll [ __ ] kill myself before

00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:36.640
i'm a part of that what happens it'd be

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:38.160
great if shane goes on their next show

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.359
and he's the one they sit down with i'm

00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:40.640

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:42.319
to they talk about two other comics i'm

00:58:42.319 --> 00:58:44.319
just trying to black out right now

00:58:44.319 --> 00:58:45.839
they talked to two other comics at the

00:58:45.839 --> 00:58:47.920
end of their comedy sets about the show

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.040
they just did

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.119
oh i thought they were like wonderful so

00:58:51.119 --> 00:58:53.520
there's no point where they do jokes

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.200
there's no point where they do comedy no

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.040
they do they just do a set they each do

00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.440
so they have the audience

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.760
imagine the audacity to read

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.000
the most famous comedians jokes in the

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.119
so now they know how to do an intro

00:59:25.119 --> 00:59:26.720
there's an outside shot that this is

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.400
good

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.240
there is say have you guys ever fought

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.839
that it's actually a really like good

00:59:39.839 --> 00:59:42.319
trick to tell these jokes before i

00:59:42.319 --> 00:59:44.400
understand that because

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.839
people are just really grateful for

00:59:45.839 --> 00:59:48.240
whatever we have to say

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.359
um

00:59:49.359 --> 00:59:51.599

00:59:51.599 --> 00:59:54.000
comedians a lot and you know we have a

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.160
lot of different methods to kind of get

00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:58.640
into their mindset and

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.799
one of them was i'm just gonna like go

01:00:00.799 --> 01:00:04.400
ahead and say that i made a puppet

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.280

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.319
mike vecchio's closing when he started

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:16.080

um but then you think like uh i should

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.560
probably just put my real name so that

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.800
the police can

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.960
find me if they need to

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.920
this is more descriptive

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.840
and he's like showing you around his

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.560
apartment and he's got some art that he

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.880

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.040
you go to the to the bedroom

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.159
and it's like happening

01:14:00.159 --> 01:14:01.760
you know maybe there comes a point where

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.719
he

01:14:02.719 --> 01:14:04.960
says something like

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.440

setup was aiming toward a punch line now

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.000

i'd love to get a piece of that

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:44.400
so they start their show

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.960
by quoting other famous comedians rape

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.960
jokes and then she's like historically

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:54.719
my rape story after that with no punch

01:19:54.719 --> 01:19:56.400
that wasn't really a rape's

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.600
she said she said she made it up it

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.600
wasn't really a story yeah so it's just

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.920
a good deal

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:04.000
she trotted out i mean she really she

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.440
can paint a picture she goes all right

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.239
so

01:20:06.239 --> 01:20:09.360
burr and ck they have these rape jokes

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:11.440
now imagine this happening let me show

soliloquy for real though

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.679
her joke was that uh some dude had bad

01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:22.000
dirty talk so she was like

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.920

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
my theory on it bobby can you be

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.159
breaking my bad dirty talk

01:20:40.159 --> 01:20:41.280

your butt doesn't smell bad here's my

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.040
theory what do you mean you want to

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.560
smell like yeah when i'm doing you from

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.560
behind sometimes your butt smells bad

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.560
sometimes it's tonight it doesn't though

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.719
you're your [ __ ] butt smells funny

01:20:54.719 --> 01:20:56.560

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:00.159
apple fritter from down at walmart

yeah can i take a piss break can i go

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.199
leave

01:21:03.199 --> 01:21:04.880
sure all right

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.800
piss if you need a piss i will give you

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.840
my theory on this whole thing right now

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.239
here played a half hour this is what i

01:21:12.239 --> 01:21:13.840
think she wrote this on paper this is

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.360
someone who doesn't do stand-up comedy

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.360
regularly here why do you believe that

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:20.159
play the line yeah um

01:21:20.159 --> 01:21:22.639
and then you say i said stop and he's

01:21:22.639 --> 01:21:24.159
like what

01:21:24.159 --> 01:21:26.639
you're like i said stop like and you

01:21:26.639 --> 01:21:29.199
didn't stop and he says

01:21:29.199 --> 01:21:31.360
just what are you accusing me of

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.520
and you're like

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.960
cool i don't know

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.400
okay i think my guess is when they wrote

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.320
that that was supposed to be a big

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.960
punchline oh i think she in her mind

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.800
when she wrote that was like here's

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.480
where we'll get a big laugh i wish you

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.000
would have said where she goes basically

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.480
what she's going is i you said stop and

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.719
you didn't stop and and he goes what are

01:21:52.719 --> 01:21:55.600
you accusing me of and she goes um i

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:56.880
don't know

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.639
but the audience is all supposed to know

01:21:58.639 --> 01:22:00.400
what you're accusing her and her saying

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.040
i don't know is funny because it's your

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.760
and then she does this it gets nothing

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.120
and then she my favorite thing the world

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:07.920
would have been if she would have said

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.159
it the words after that and she goes so

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:13.600
it usually kills um all right so

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.760
see where you guys she goes yeah because

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.080
that's usually how i get off stage

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.480
that is exactly what just happened watch

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.480
she's expecting a big laugh now keep

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.159
playing it she she thought that would

01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:25.600
hit i don't know

01:29:45.679 --> 01:29:47.440
rebecca

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.880
just

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.880
just wondering i won when was her last

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.040
period

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.080
and i was like

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.520
my mom's always asking me the last time

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.600
i had a bm

01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.520
bowel movement

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.679
so this is that crushed

01:30:01.679 --> 01:30:03.440
you can barely hear laughs i hear every

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.639
time her mouth opens again

01:30:06.639 --> 01:30:08.400
so you know so my mom comes over because

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:11.199
she comes over always on wednesdays

01:30:11.199 --> 01:30:12.560
and um

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.639
um so then my mom she comes over as she

01:30:14.639 --> 01:30:16.639
always does on wednesdays and then we

01:30:16.639 --> 01:30:17.679
you know we sit down we have some

01:30:17.679 --> 01:30:19.280
mimosas and then she starts talking to

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.480
me so

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.320
my mom comes over on sundays and then

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:23.760
we're having mimosas and we're talking

all these sorts of things you know like

01:35:02.239 --> 01:35:04.080

01:44:43.119 --> 01:44:45.040
[ __ ] we could all agree trump's number

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.679
one i'm willing to 72 year old in the

01:44:47.679 --> 01:44:50.159
world is donald trump without a doubt

01:44:50.159 --> 01:44:52.639
politics aside honest

01:44:52.639 --> 01:44:54.800
hottest 72 year old

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.800
hottest 72 year old in the world is

01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.800
donald trump definitely maybe you're for

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:01.040
universal no no dude and someone else

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.119

01:45:03.119 --> 01:45:04.719
donald trump could get his dick sucked

01:45:04.719 --> 01:45:07.440

saying donald trump's the highest right

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.320
now there's too much heat on him but if
