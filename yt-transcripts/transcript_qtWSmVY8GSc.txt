Title: Irish Goodbye #133 - Falling Down The Steps (with Shane Gillis)
Description: Comedian Shane Gillis joins Mike Cannon and Mike Feeney for Irish Goodbye Podcast! Luis J Gomez honors us with his presence at the top of this week’s episode to call Shane out for being much nicer off air. Cannon describes seeing Shane enter a room soaking wet after bring caught a torrential downpour, just around the time Feeney ordered seamless. Cannon berates an “overactive” fan for Facebook calling him, only to find out it was an accident. The guys discuss coming up in comedy, occasionally performing for nobody, and Shane’s zero fucks given attitude while drunk. Plus, the gang tells way more stories than they knew they had about times when they fell down the steps!

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.480

any [ __ ] nicer than his personality

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.720
on podcast is the [ __ ] [ __ ] and

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.720
but it's the Puerto Rican snake-oil

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.540
trash me correctly I thought it was

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.730
trashing was also leaving off the rattle

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.510
part wow I didn't realize there was

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:47.670
gonna be so much tension yeah next week

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.560
your kids oooh I fit by the time this

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.180

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.269
welcome this place live he might be here

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.829
whoo not right but this comes that he

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.019
may come out behind this plays live he

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:09.549
might be playing live alive where's that

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.150
drum but we we have a great show my

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:22.660
heart is racing so and this could be

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.850
because he's obviously out of shape and

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.800
just isn't used to exerting that much

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.650
energy he had the white [ __ ] gathering

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.830
at the little cookie cookie crumbs crook

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.979
he comes was like like rabid dog right

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.460
like I think a lot of that was real

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.260
here's what happened he just got done

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.750
recording a podcast with Bisping so he's

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.169
in fighter mode like let's talk

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.250
testosterone that's a good energy to go

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.180
pick up his kid which are you knew my

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.520
son but it runs high knees or a children

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.870

that's what always seems to happen

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.580
though but it is very fun trashing Louis

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.169
I gotta be honest it's the best

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.419
well because it's such a good sport

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.610
about it yes but he's also a [ __ ]

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.000
open wound clearly yes dealing with his

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.070
own trauma and eventually it all spills

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.870
out of his mouth at once I mean I could

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.440

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:46.540
white yesterday I I was I was home when

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.820
that hurricane thing hit and I had jut

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.340
like I'd pressed send to hit delivery

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.930
like to get like seamless web and then I

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.910
opened I heard noise and I looked out

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:59.050
and I I opened the blind of my to look

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.610
outside they like outdoor area I have

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.060
and a chair my chair went flying past

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.180
the frame like just got shotgun to cross

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.580
all my balcony area yeah I just went

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.680
flying and I and I tried to open the

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.150
door but the wind was so strong it

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.680
wouldn't open I had to just wait I look

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.210
maybe it's there maybe it's not and it

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:17.860
was against the next person like fence

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.230
like up almost over it was crazy dude

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.540
guy get there so the guy the delivery

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.370
an hour so here's the thing I was like

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.630
what do I do in this situation I gotta

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.450
be understanding of this you know and so

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.370
average but if Rebecca's Trent's

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.470
facebook statuses mean anything to you

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.200
that's the time to order real it from

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.520
these places yes especially the

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.020
mom-and-pop places because the weather

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.120
actually destroys their potential income

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.820
so if you order from them and obviously

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.490
tip in a oh yeah in a proper compensator

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.890
but like if you're supposed to order at

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.570
that time so this guy Mexicans out

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.290
ironically I ordered Mexican food so I

like a comedy club in a time capsule

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.780
inside a genies bottle you know the

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.310

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.610
okay like a geocities website and they

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.550
then the banner is like a proud we don't

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:00.120
develop new comedian

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.680

talent nights [ __ ] you if we don't know

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.160

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.290
first started comedy I was like oh whoa

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.180

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.990
say it's gotta work to avoid it yeah you

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.640
gotta get good enough to be like when

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.200
you get an offer to do that you can be

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.820
like now now this for sure I've talked

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.530
about on the podcast but that was my

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.480
first comedy show ever as a kid was

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.280

well those young comedian things that

do there those show like they were so

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.470
[ __ ] hot that's the only live

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.300
performance of stand up in a club that

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.250
really kind of felt like you were there

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.290
because it was such a hot crowd they

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.030
weren't like that Kinison set is like

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:01.120

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.770
crowd you know that room is still

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.530
capable of it yeah well I again just

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.330
need to also defend them I did only do

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.830

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:33.820
when there's people so what I would say

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.960

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.150

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.410
back to them about things I've said even

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.720
vaguely about so we talked about on now

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.750
the last step yeah I won't subject you

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.210
absolute [ __ ] rantings of a lunatic I

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.950
don't care but your uncle's doing

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.240
stand-up before long as he'd been doing

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.400
I like three years all right but three

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.750
years in the sense that like he'll do it

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.970
once a month highs you know that is

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.760
horrendous and then he's beyond yeah and

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.740
not to mention he'll also complain about

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.560
the business as if he's like us yeah but

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:09.060
that's I remember that nobody asked them

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.650
to I remember doing the thing where

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.360
you'd be like somebody would get Fallon

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.190
and like to hear saying and you're like

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.170
oh god I was like don't care anymore

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.780
they're not even booked in town they're

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.430
filling a quota who's getting people

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.260
that aren't even ready yeah this is he

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.930
puts his name in a bucket they're just

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.310
letting the same guy do it for like the

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.280
seventh time what does he got to offer

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.870
yeah that's yeah that was a tough that's

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.010
a tough thing to break out of in

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.470
stand-up oh yeah then negative and you

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:38.700
were you started in failure

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.560
I wasn't Fillion up until like last year

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.500
I was miserable they say just what

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.540
Cummings went well like this year things

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.460
have been going well yeah so before that

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.580
I mean I was I was just as good right I

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.500
didn't have I wasn't in New York and

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.730
didn't have like representation or

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.550
anything oh yeah any affirmation like no

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.440
after me so it's just me arguing with

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.300
[ __ ] like whoa comics in Philly every

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.920
day it's fairly well they're open

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.730
microphone scene yeah has awoke

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:07.620
contingency right cuz they're the less

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.650
funny of the team they're not passed at

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.090
the local club so then they resent

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.740
everyone that's at the local club yeah

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.770
and then yeah racism they used to be

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.000
such a funny thing cuz it's like you

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.800
couldn't like what I feel like when we

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.380
started it was like you get good in bars

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.090
and do it in open mics and stuff and

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:24.630
then when

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.310
to do the bars you get to go to the

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.420
clubs and I want to get to the club's

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:28.590
you like okay cool that's how you make

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.330
money and do things to self and now it's

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.710
like if you do clubs be like oh you're a

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.260
club comic that was the same when we

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.180
started though cuz a special thing was

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.500
really big did you ever go on that

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.150
website and how long you been doing it

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.430
I started like eight years ago okay so

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.910
yeah weird a little I'm 10 yeah same

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.380
with you I'd say right and started in

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.900
[ __ ] mechanicsburg crude no [ __ ]

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.570
first six so I was doing what your uncle

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.460
was doing okay yeah yeah I mean I was at

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.650
the beginning so I I'm I'm not better

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.470
than him in terms of effort I'm just

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.390
saying that if you don't have to do this

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:03.240
and to complain about it is just such an

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.160
odd phenomenon hilarious he's

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.740
complaining of course yeah and talking

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.270
to me about it as if I'm not about to

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:14.310
have a [ __ ] kid you know this is my

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.000
job

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.890
you don't have to do this yet nobody

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.600
asked you to you're not being paid

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.520
you're running open mic you take grainy

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.590
pictures of it every [ __ ] week and

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.420
post every goddamn comedian as if

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.010
they're rocking the Hat like get the

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.460
[ __ ] your cheeseball capital killed yeah

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:34.080
is it just like three likes yeah it's

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.150
like you know that's what I used to do

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.650
in the beginning of Instagram but then

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:39.570
you develop and now Instagram is what it

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:39.900
is

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.520
and you go back and delete all that

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:47.400
evidence I have not manicured a single

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.380
thing haven't blocked people on Facebook

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.270
that's why I'm stepping away because my

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.890
facebook looks like the walls of a

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.200
psychiatric ward like I used to have a

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.270
conspiracy podcast so it's flat earthers

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.490
it's like a nice comic going against

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.410
each other you know is Sandy Hook was

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:05.190
fake like all that [ __ ] it was it's a

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:14.700
bananas place it was we rise up the SEO

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.450
rankings but [ __ ] man see but the thing

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.310
that immediately is this it may be a

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.290
shitty thing on my part the thing that I

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.150
immediately liked you for was when I did

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.330
your show on compound Network that that

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.210
you that you brought a six-pack with you

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.950

great this guy drinks I'm already I'm

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.150
already on board with him and then you

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:39.850
proceeded you drank the six

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:43.840
for all of us and you just you just kept

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.250
putting it back in the brown paper bag

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:46.929
you kept the the six holder and you just

00:24:46.929 --> 00:24:50.470
were like alright this was it was a

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.150
one-hour show and they were gone

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.700
yeah powers there's been some episodes

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.950
where it's been like a 12 pack in the

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.840
hour and then at the end of the hour I'm

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:04.779
like keep going this podcast is great by

00:25:04.779 --> 00:25:06.100
the end of it my black people are

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:16.059
[ __ ] that's our drop for when any of

00:25:16.059 --> 00:25:18.760
us kind of edge into that water it's

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.179
kind of like a Taser to get back on oh

00:25:21.179 --> 00:25:25.330
but that's another thing I love I love

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.070
our listeners they're the best but not

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.110

00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:26.039
in the world to wake up with though so

me this could be the player empowerment

00:27:42.929 --> 00:27:44.399
era for comedians

00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:46.289
you know how in the audio right now

00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:47.580
everybody's kind of picking their own

team they're picking who they want to

00:27:48.899 --> 00:27:50.789
play with yeah they had they hold all

00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:53.399
the [ __ ] power this I believe is the

00:27:53.399 --> 00:27:54.929
closest to player empowerment for

00:27:54.929 --> 00:27:57.059

a comedy treating it she was like great

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:16.440

she's and I introduce myself again

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:23.250
because I'll forget what you look I've

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.770
had a contentious reintroductions where

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.690
I'm just like hey I'm Mike they're like

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.390
I know we've we did that wait why do

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.340
people do it's like hey nice to meet you

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.480
and they're like we've actually met like

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.940
three times yeah yeah great make an

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:40.380
impression do ya you know if we have

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.350
talked several different times and your

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:46.020
face triggers [ __ ] nothing it is kind

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.000
of on you like you have to end drinking

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.390
I've been right yeah there's nothing I

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.890
hate more than when someone says that to

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.720
me but I've definitely also saw it

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.310
happens all the time but I'll say it to

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:59.250
people if it's like if maybe I mean it

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:00.870
has to be an egregious amount of times

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.910
but I try to always disarm it by being

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.140
like oh what's up dude yeah we met

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.490
before it this thing I'll try say we're

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.140
nothing like yeah we've met before yes

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.550
because also that's a weird thing if you

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.200
go we met before I go from where now I

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.850
have to ask you like I don't believe you

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.380
where did I meet you you know and then

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.060
it could be like you yelled at me and a

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.300
comedy central party I do a brief aside

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.400

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.760
minutes

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.530

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.470
so I he did like get high and go to bed

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:59.839
by myself yeah sad nights that's how it

00:38:59.839 --> 00:39:01.609
was with me into stéfano though because

00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:03.470
he's like he's not like that at all but

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.329
I was like you know rip-roarin out on

00:39:05.329 --> 00:39:06.650
the road from there it's time getting

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:08.000
free drinks drinking with the staff

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.640
getting [ __ ] weird yeah and we would

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.619
share hotel rooms cuz he has you know

00:39:12.619 --> 00:39:15.650

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.660
and like headbutt the [ __ ] coffee no

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:22.700
he'd just be like he'd love it I guess

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.440
like a person who's could see that

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.970
really so when he does drink just very

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:27.859
rarely right yeah yeah it doesn't that's

00:39:27.859 --> 00:39:30.819
the right that's correct

00:39:30.819 --> 00:39:33.260
it's a weird thing when someone who

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:36.020
doesn't drink like kind of like almost

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.849
gets off to somebody when they're like

00:39:37.849 --> 00:39:39.829
shit-faced or you know it's no you know

00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:41.060
if you like stone they're like hey

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.890

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.540
you doing so it's [ __ ] hammered I'm

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.690
so happy like my friend Chris O'Conner

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:52.010
he's a comic from Philly he's hilarious

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.870
but he when he gets [ __ ] up it's like

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.610
my favorite thing in the world yeah just

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.080
to watch him scurry around cuz he makes

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.050
the same mistakes I do you go around you

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:01.940
see somebody that like you think sucks a

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.680
comedy yeah yeah you know you're not

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.510
that [ __ ] great that's the best is

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.340
when you can watch it and it kind of

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.950
green lights your own behavior reduces

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.270
your anxiety because you're like at

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.860
least somebody else is out there tearing

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.200
it up the same way yeah this is someone

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:23.960
else is also unlikable so we [ __ ] so

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.730
it's the the day of the stand thing

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:26.990
going off and this actually ties in

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:28.400
perfectly with the drinking so I am

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.960

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:20.670
you know they had to help him out of the

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:22.260
showroom and he's just kind of stumbling

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.700
there and they're telling him he's gotta

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.170
like pay his check and he's just like

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:27.180
throwing money down and then like and

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.380
then they do that thing to drunk you

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.640
when you're really shit-faced and you're

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.810
like you know you kind of [ __ ] up

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:32.400
so youse put your hands in your pocket

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:38.490
as you walk [ __ ] hands in the pocket

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:45.480
is a real move so I can do this really

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.790
lose balance oh yeah a drunk person try

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:48.930
to get something out of their pocket

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:57.600
it's like I saw somebody bit of bite it

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.120
doing that like trying to reach into our

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.210
pocket and instantly just lose all

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:04.710
equilibrium and go down and brace their

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:08.280
fall with their face just full no arms

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.460
can't like this is gonna be shoulder and

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.590

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.200
happen to me at one of these parties

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.150
moments after two people were people

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:19.680
that pretty shit-faced there I will say

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.270
cuz when I came back it was one of those

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:24.270
things where I had left for just enough

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:26.040
time where people probably got two to

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.110
three drinks more in them and so then

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:29.790
people were like kind of like yeah but

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.100

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.070
why I [ __ ] love you good looks like

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:37.320
going inside at dusk and then coming

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.390
back out an hour later thinking the Sun

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:43.530
sets don't cry but it's pitch black out

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:45.450
to another bar afterwards yeah I got

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:50.340
like a fight with like a [ __ ] a guy

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.910
with a ponytail that was playing pool

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.870
started heckling him and he didn't like

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:58.050

00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:59.700

00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:24.760
talent he has yeah he brought a pool cue

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:29.559
I remember yeah yeah and then we talked

00:44:29.559 --> 00:44:31.630
to Thomas [ __ ] and it got to the point

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:33.700
where I was like I'm gonna [ __ ] this guy

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.599

00:44:37.599 --> 00:44:40.510
med too horribly out of shape and so

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:43.569
then one of one of the comics challenged

00:44:43.569 --> 00:44:46.569

he was like we don't play [ __ ]

00:44:50.440 --> 00:45:04.930
doubles as much as like you just said

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.789

yeah he was like no you're not and so

00:45:14.769 --> 00:45:16.869
then he faced off one-on-one with a

00:45:16.869 --> 00:45:23.049
comic and he scratched on the break the

00:45:23.049 --> 00:45:24.849
ball went off the table and I was like

00:45:24.849 --> 00:45:27.220

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.430
zip up your pool cue and go home you

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.029

00:45:49.029 --> 00:45:56.339
afterwards what did he did he like

00:45:56.339 --> 00:45:58.839

00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:01.119

up to the other guy if he wants to

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.700
account that as a loss or not and then

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.619
that's the rule like he was like sad ah

00:46:29.619 --> 00:46:32.130
