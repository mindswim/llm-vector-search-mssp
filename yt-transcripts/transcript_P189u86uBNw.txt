medical help

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.240

00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:54.000
and i thought i was the spirit of a

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.360
human being was coming through the

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.680
headphones and trying to possess our

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.839

00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:01.839
got the power of two humans

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:05.040
one of whom keeps going

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.240
he's not the most eloquent human i

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.279
honestly thought it was the audio of

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.839
they're getting better that was a

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:31.440
[ __ ] good one that was like my cat's

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.399
gone bit on steroids but the crowds just

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:35.920
the crowd's just learning to trust you

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.920
again give him a couple yeah i take

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.440
chances not only people don't have three

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.519
more fight and rape jokes and then

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:43.120
they'll trust you again this is it

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.160
there's going to be a lot more than

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.680
three three

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.600

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.720
is over

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.880

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.680
for sure it's got to be a weird feeling

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.120
but how long does it take to smack you

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.720
where you're like this is not a good

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.240

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.640
effect is there anything else like that

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.400
still because you're sort of a fear of

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.799
it always coming back right oh wow yeah

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:34.320

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.320
oh here's a fun fact i uh

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.160
like was it three weeks ago i just

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.000
started pissing blood clots out of

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.760
nowhere did you start drinking it you're

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.679
like

00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:50.170
my favorite flavor

00:17:50.170 --> 00:18:00.020
[Laughter]

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.559
and it nourishes me

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.679
not to ruin the clear uh

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:25.520
stream to the point that i was gonna

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.280
make by you uh sucking your own blood

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.240

did you feel can i ask you did you feel

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:37.520
when you started realizing it was like

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.360
reversing at least some degree or like

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.640
subside right you could go back and

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.480
they'd find out like the numbers of

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.919
whatever you need to be better better or

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:45.280
better right we don't mean to get too

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.039
technical for you yeah but uh you know

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:48.080
we finally found out that it was

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.840
reversing when you're stuck

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.520
when the stuff's not happening and the

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.440
cancer is going away let's use layman's

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.520
terms so that people can understand um

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.799

00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:59.360

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.919

specific body type

00:50:23.119 --> 00:50:25.280

their chair it just goes down yeah

00:50:37.359 --> 00:50:39.359
the market is a little bit too niche and

00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:41.520
that's why i'm out oh look at dave

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.220
marginalizing cripples foreign

00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:51.200

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.640

happening dave

00:53:29.599 --> 00:53:31.680
he whipped it up and now that's a tizzy

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.680
i'm in the middle of making a bad joke

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:37.079
my mouth is

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.280
i feel a [ __ ] flip of liquid from the

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.520
[ __ ] floor

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.119

00:53:49.119 --> 00:53:51.359
conditioning water and floor so you're

00:53:51.359 --> 00:53:52.960
fine dude it's nothing it's just air

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.200
conditioning water and 20 years of open

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.610
mic or crushed dreams

00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:59.760
[Laughter]

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.599
good news i heard donald glover once

00:54:01.599 --> 00:54:03.839
walked up here

00:54:03.839 --> 00:54:06.319
he did right pretty exciting yeah

00:54:06.319 --> 00:54:09.359
yeah no so anyway so then you understood

00:54:09.359 --> 00:54:11.680
jay's struggle with you because you had

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.200
to go through this to understand other

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.880
grown men don't want liquid poured on

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.480
them yeah

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.079
i get it now finally

00:54:18.079 --> 00:54:19.680
i still think you overreact

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.839
no no i don't he doesn't overreact i

00:54:21.839 --> 00:54:24.640
describe it more as a tizzy yeah i over

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.920
tizzy for sure

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.160
but overreact no because here's the

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.359
thing if there's something happen once

00:54:29.359 --> 00:54:31.680
in a while there'd be a minimal reaction

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.960
i believed you for a second i i faced

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.880
time lewis while i was playing it he

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.559

00:57:34.559 --> 00:57:36.240
anyone knows the show knows louis lives

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.400
45 minutes one of our early things was

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.000
being uh legion of skanks was what we

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.680
named our guitar hero that's the first

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.280
thing ever well before we ever the first

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.480
time we ever used the name legion of

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.960
skanks for anything jay's wife everyone

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:47.839
a lot of people didn't know this but

00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:49.520
jay's wife was mad at him because he was

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.520
you know probably doing some shady [ __ ]

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:52.799
sure she goes yeah why don't you go out

00:57:52.799 --> 00:57:55.200
there and [ __ ] your legion of skanks and

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.880
then he told me the story was i there

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.640
you were there i turned around and we

00:57:58.640 --> 00:57:59.920
both kind of looked at you like that's a

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.119
great band name yeah it's a great

00:58:01.119 --> 00:58:03.280
[ __ ] band name

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.400
and then we made it we made it our

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.520
guitar here yeah

00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.880
which is probably where it should have

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.119
stopped yeah

00:58:09.119 --> 00:58:11.040
but you know that's fair

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.599
but this is your ex-wife yeah yeah yeah

00:58:13.599 --> 00:58:15.520
so we uh this is i gotta i'm sorry this

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.880

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.720
a really serious moment but for us it

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.119
was this yeah the start of the podcast

00:58:33.119 --> 00:58:35.760

and create an awkward moment she beat

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.920
the [ __ ] out of me i didn't think she

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.119

01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:30.400
mania i'll tell you what i had an

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.839
interesting thing this weekend i was

01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:34.079
watching a tell and uh jeff ross did

01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:34.880
their

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.920
their three-part special for uh netflix

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.079
and the netflix people were there uh

01:04:40.079 --> 01:04:41.440
robbie was there and i've known robbie

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.720
for years you know and i didn't even

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.920
think about

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.359
that i'm like robbie's the person who

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:47.200
like bought that special you know so

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.799
it's weird hearing his like perspective

01:04:48.799 --> 01:04:51.039
on it too what are you saying about us

01:04:51.039 --> 01:04:52.880
no no he was just saying no yeah i guess

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.000
so he was like yeah everyone's like

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.520
trashing and i know but he's like you

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.799
know he's like i bought it i thought it

01:04:56.799 --> 01:04:58.880
was a good thing i go yeah dude i don't

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.319
i took he was drunk so it took me a

01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:02.160
while to explain that like

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.760
i'm like i'm not [ __ ] on the i mean

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.200
we ended up shooting on the special but

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.200
we're only going at the special at all

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.799
we know it's not our cup of tea but

01:05:08.799 --> 01:05:10.720
we're going at it because it's just her

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.799
attack on anything else besides

01:05:12.799 --> 01:05:14.480
yelling about being raped it seems like

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.160
she's like that's not comedy and also

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.359
the first five minutes where we just

01:05:17.359 --> 01:05:18.720
went after you better get your dick

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.760
touched if you want to do comments

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.760
[ __ ] horrible the the first the first

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.200
worst things ever the first five minutes

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.559
where we just went after her physical

01:05:24.559 --> 01:05:25.599
appearance

01:05:25.599 --> 01:05:27.039
that was just low-hanging fruit and what

01:05:27.039 --> 01:05:28.720
am i supposed to do oh come on i mean

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.559
you know you put yourself on our radar

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:32.640
if you listen to the last episode and

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.160
didn't think that the message was that

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.400
we were supporting that special i don't

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.640
know what you were listening to

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.160
i i kind of agree with that we were

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.000
supporting the special's existence

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.480
completely yeah we watched it we had we

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.960
put eyes on it yeah no [ __ ]

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.839
we gave it three stars

01:05:48.839 --> 01:05:51.520
um everybody we're gonna be right back

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.520
with the second half of the show

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.000
it's the legion of snakes

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.080
[Applause]

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:09.500
[Music]

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.880
i will say the only reason i know you're

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.039
really my friend jay yeah is because of

01:06:13.039 --> 01:06:15.200
your fear of this fight

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.079
um i just listen everything i believe in

01:06:18.079 --> 01:06:19.440
here i believe

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.680
you don't mean that that's insane but

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.119
you were just saying off camera that you

01:06:23.119 --> 01:06:25.440
fear this fight every day

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.520
i live in that fear

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.640
the fear

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.400
is what fuels me

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.280
um

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.960
no i'm uh yeah i don't want to see my

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.119
buddy get uh hit it all but i believe in

01:06:35.119 --> 01:06:37.039
you to win i've never known how close we

01:06:37.039 --> 01:06:38.559
were until you told me you don't want to

01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:41.359
see me hurt in public

01:06:41.359 --> 01:06:43.280
well it's the thing of the the pain of

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.880
being hit i was making this point to you

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.200
i think this is really true you

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.079
you

01:06:48.079 --> 01:06:49.839
we associate punching and kicking with

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:53.680
this don't be like brick be like water

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.960
i thought he was gonna give the [ __ ]

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.920
uh sam elliott speech from roadhouse

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.480
no you we associate punching and kicking

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.359
as a very violent scary act and the idea

01:07:03.359 --> 01:07:05.680
of being punched in the face society

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.839
tells us that hitting is wrong

01:07:07.839 --> 01:07:09.839
but at this point a punch in the face to

01:07:09.839 --> 01:07:12.640
me it's like a kiss from my mama

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.620
that's how i'm not afraid i am [ __ ] boy

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:17.359
[Laughter]

01:07:17.359 --> 01:07:20.000
the point i'm making is uh the pain from

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.640
a toothache is way worse than the pain

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.760
from being punched in the face if you've

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.000
ever had a [ __ ] toothache it's brutal

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.559
it's a nightmare what is pain

01:07:28.559 --> 01:07:30.319
it's not life

01:07:30.319 --> 01:07:32.240
yeah i'm done i just got punched in the

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.359
liver which is just

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.039
the pain is nothing it's like food

01:07:37.039 --> 01:07:38.559
poisoning barely even like food

01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:40.160
poisoning whatever it's like a toothache

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:43.400

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.640
then a baggy t-shirt was covering the

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.199

01:19:25.199 --> 01:19:30.080
also that's one tower 911 didn't kill it

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.320

01:19:44.239 --> 01:19:47.440

oh [ __ ] that's actually even better of a

01:49:20.239 --> 01:49:21.760
website that it just doesn't tell you

01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.599
anything it just just lets you sit with

01:49:23.599 --> 01:49:26.000
yourself after that yeah you just played

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.239
that game you figured yeah [ __ ]

01:49:28.239 --> 01:49:29.840
figure it out you go look in the mirror

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:32.320
and ask yourself some questions yeah

01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:34.560
do you really want these results

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.719
do you that's a really a website where

01:49:36.719 --> 01:49:38.800
you have to figure out yourself i think

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.199
so it doesn't have a clip

01:49:41.199 --> 01:49:42.400
there's nothing attached to give you the

01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:44.159
actual results what i was telling you

01:49:44.159 --> 01:49:46.560

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:51.280
