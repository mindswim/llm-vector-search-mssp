starts [ __ ] like hell yeah yeah i

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.760
thought that's a good fine i thought of

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.440
you i was listening to the the hardcore

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.399
history uh which one the last one is on

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:46.399
japan but it's it's getting into like

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:49.040
the firebombings

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.320
you don't wanna you don't wanna know

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.560
dude i to know so there would there were

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.399
certain times where wind conditions like

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:57.440
in dresden in germany slaughter earlier

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.560
yeah yeah

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.240
thank you but yeah where it would just

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.600
start

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.920
like a fire tornado

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.920
and they the the government the u.s

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.519
figured out how to like manufacture

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.959
these what so they were just hitting

00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:11.360
japan with just fire tornadoes how they

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.040
figured that out what they just they

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.480
would figure out how much like how the

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.279
wind was going and how much incendiaries

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:19.680
they needed to drop and uh they would

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.720
just start fire tornadoes in japan yeah

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.320
community the science backs it up

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.400

first time you've heard of it but i

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.799

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.080
yeah dude apparently she got [ __ ]

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.679
touched by this r

00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:10.320
what yeah you didn't know that

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.720
she was one of nassar's victims yeah

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.520
whoa

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.799
yeah i heard about this and i was like

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:15.760
yeah

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.720
of course

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.919
yeah she probably do

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.000
these people train their entire lives

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.440
they have no choice they become gymnasts

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.679
she probably won and it was like

00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:27.360
whatever that wasn't as cool as i

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.880
thought it would be and she just like

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.799
the whole [ __ ] trial happened and she

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:31.679
was like i don't want to think about

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:33.919
gymnastics anymore

00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:35.600
fair enough that's what i thought i

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.440
think that's probably exactly what

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.960
happened i heard that she was having a

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.159
hard time knowing where she was in the

00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:41.120
air

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.960
i saw that yeah what i saw a clip of

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.039
that well she just i guess gymnast that

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:46.799
happens to them while they're in the air

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:48.880
they kind of get disoriented and it like

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.240
[ __ ] them up the whole trick to being a

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.080
gymnast is like knowing where exactly

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.039
you are in the air oh i thought you

00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:54.559
meant like an identity crisis i thought

00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:55.760
she would like become airborne and be

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.480

00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:31.279
movements of the horses look

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:32.880
choreographed for the music that's

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.519
completely on accident

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:37.279
it's the one thing that looks cool and

00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:38.880
they just play random background music

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.320
that's designed not to spook them are

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.760
the horses dancing kind of they're

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.760
prancing around there's like a side step

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.519
they go backwards so you kind of see how

00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:46.960
your horse moves and then you pick out

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.799
the soundtrack no no the music is played

00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:51.039
randomly for every horse what yeah so

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:53.279
they just do their set routine and there

00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:54.640
happens to be music and every now and

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.880

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:01.360
dude now you mentioned it there's shots

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.880
now there was a

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.039
horse that lived there was a at the end

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:07.039
of our street this house they just owned

00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:08.960
a horse for some reason

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.480
i live in a neighborhood like there's no

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.359
reason

00:34:11.359 --> 00:34:13.280
and uh they would just tie it up out

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.079
front

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:16.720
so there's just a giant [ __ ] horse

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.879
always tied up to a tree and it was

00:34:18.879 --> 00:34:21.599
there for 20 years yeah man so yes i did

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:23.200
so [ __ ] sad my whole life there's

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.879
just been a dirty horse at the end of

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:26.960
our street you've never seen it

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.639
off the post they don't ride it around

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.960
they had a small pen in the back

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.480
and my dog would run out of our house

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.240
and every time he escaped he would

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.720
sprint straight to this [ __ ] horse

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.399
all day everything dogs hate horses he

00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:40.399
thought about this horse nonstop he must

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:41.599
have been like dude the second i'm

00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:43.040
getting out i'm gonna [ __ ] this [ __ ]

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.960
horse up [ __ ] he just ran out and it

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.480
was i was a little kid i was always so

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.240
scared barking the whole shack was in

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.320
the cage with yeah man it's terrifying

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.879
yeah i thought shaq was gonna die yeah

00:34:52.879 --> 00:34:55.200
one hoof to the head yeah man it's a

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.560
fateful end which would have been a

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.480
funny way for a dog to die oh yeah

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.160
seeing your dog kicking the head in the

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.640
horse today

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.839
[Laughter]

00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:04.960
because the horse probably would they're

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.920
all skittish she would have done it

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.599
accidentally it would have been like

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:08.480
yeah

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.520
it would have been graceful like

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.920
dressage true it's how do you say it

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.400
dressage dressage yeah

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.680
and i come from a part of the country

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.040
where people ride their horses on the

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.200
streets yeah and uh my friend jesse

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.480
kendig whenever he would see people

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.320
riding their horses if he was driving he

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.000
would honk his horn real loud and they

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.280
would all spaz

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.800
and just people like falling off like

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.880

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.240
growing up where i came from the rodeo

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.079

across the street from my friend's house

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.119
there's just a ton of [ __ ] horses you

00:35:59.119 --> 00:36:00.800
take you could hit one and there'd be

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.720
yeah chaos yeah

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.079
all you just hit one you'd see it's

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:06.800
muscle flinch

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.400

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.680
my mom my mom spends money for her

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.200
retirement sitting in front of her rose

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.520
garden with a bb gun just shooting deer

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.280
whenever they dare to come up and eat a

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.400
rose that's funny yeah they'll [ __ ] your

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.640
garden up oh yeah she's she's she's the

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.800
right to do so yeah these horses did

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.880
nothing she's well within her rights

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.040
yeah she is yeah she is and that's not

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.720
gonna hurt the deer it'll just sting a

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.720
deer yeah that's not gonna can you kill

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.720
somebody who like can you always kill

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.680
somebody if they're on your private

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.680
property or muscle doctrine

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.200
is that what it is

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.880
yeah so you

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.240
if they're not if they're like hey sir

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.599
i'm lost can you immediately take their

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:44.240
life i believe so i think uh that's true

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.599
but you cannot kill a deer on your

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:47.680
property because that's poaching

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.520
really if you get busted killing a deer

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.680
that's like an offense on your property

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.920
yeah what yeah you have to hunt

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.920
protected lands

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.000
whoa yeah but if a person comes on you

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
can wipe them out

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.640
nice yeah can you detain them i think

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.079
that's kidnapping if they're on your

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:05.599
property i mean if you detain them and

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:06.960
then turn them in question if you

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.119
apprehend give back to the law

00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:11.200
that's okay but if you like torture them

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.240
and give you no just questions just

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.960
question guys this question

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.960
just detained questioned

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.720
and then killed

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.920
i think it happened videoed the whole

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.040
thing and it went to court and here's

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.000
what i did yeah your honor

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.680
yeah i think it has to be reflected i'd

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.680
like to report the crime of trespassing

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.520
yeah

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.839
exhibits

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.839
that's pretty good though it's good you

00:37:35.839 --> 00:37:37.839
can do that yeah i mean most states i

00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:39.119
think well at least the good ones you

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:41.040
can you can filter someone with holes as

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.720
soon as they ask for directions the fan

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.359
of property yeah dude i would you uh you

00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:46.800
[ __ ] with the french revolution who

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.760
doesn't

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.200
versailles i was reading about um

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.960
the you know the decades

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.640
the guys that try to replace the

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.119
calendar or the week with the ten day

00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:58.079
period

00:37:58.079 --> 00:37:59.760
i never heard about this

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.760
dude in the french revolution i think

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.440
someone started it first but robespierre

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.000
and uh his evil henchmen

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.160
passed they eliminated the seven day

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.240
week and they had a thing called the the

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.119
decade so they had like premundi segundi

00:38:13.119 --> 00:38:14.400
and they had like a

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.320
calendar completely devoid of like

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.640
catholic christian holidays and they did

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.320
this for a while and if they caught you

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.680
and they enforced it if they caught you

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.000
in your sunday's best so if it were like

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.520

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.280

honoring the sabbath no way they wanted

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.839
to get rid of the sabbath that's because

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:41.280
they're evil communists

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.040
that's what it is they're evil hippies

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.400

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.599
dude i'm telling you they wanted to have

00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:48.000
a rationalistic science-based

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.839
kind of like people who worship the

00:38:49.839 --> 00:38:50.880

hard they actually passed it

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.599
and they still have days like their

00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:16.880
holidays so

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.880
on like every 10th day i think they had

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.560
36 10 day periods but i don't know what

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.240
they did with the other five days but

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.000
they had uh

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.280
they had the holidays that were just

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.040
like it's old people day and you'd be

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.200
like nice and they'd be like

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.320
it's a patriotism day and he'd be like

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.160
yeah they had the shittiest dumbest

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.480
civic holiday it was so funny yeah they

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.720
sucked yeah dude apparently the book i'm

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.560
reading is all about the how we have a

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.520
seven day week and they were saying the

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.680
author's jewish he's slam dunk in that

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.200
one he's like that was the chase he's

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.119
like we started the seven day week

00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:50.720
he said we were the first people

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.160
everyone else was like [ __ ] around

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.079
with like seven day ten day six day they

00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:56.560
would watch the planets and be like the

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.480
last planet you saw before this period

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.720
of time if you saw the moon in the sky

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.280
moon monday lunas whatever all this

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.760
stuff venus and um

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.839
they uh

00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:09.440
eventually but they'd have to just like

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.280
get rid of days

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.720
so like you'd have the planet like you

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.839
wouldn't see a certain planet so you'd

00:40:13.839 --> 00:40:15.119
be like monday tuesday and they'd be

00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:16.880
like no wednesday this week it's friday

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.640
you know what the [ __ ] it's confusing

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.400
the jews took it away from the celestial

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.839
bodies and like dude it's monday through

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:23.520
friday or monday through sunday the jews

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.960
control the days of the week they

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.480

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.079
they controlled

00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:33.920
the week you're not allowed to say that

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.359
that was the sabbath well they had the

00:40:35.359 --> 00:40:37.040

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.960
guess we have friday now

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.560
because you needed to have muslims so

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.079

00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:47.280

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.160
loved tgif oh my god dude [ __ ] enchilada

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.400
dude

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.760
yeah the book is sick talking about how

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.200
people just so many people have tried to

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.440
stop the seven day week and he was like

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.960
it's just too good matt what i love

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.880
about you as a listener of this podcast

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.480
is the fact that you said you're reading

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.040
a book about the seven days of the week

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.359
dude and anyone else describing it would

00:41:17.359 --> 00:41:19.680
be the most boring [ __ ] story i've

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.599
ever heard but somehow you made it dude

00:41:21.599 --> 00:41:23.200
i'm telling you i've been wrapped thank

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.200
you bro yeah it's hard i i wanted to

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.480
have a better understanding like match

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.680
the planets but it's so [ __ ]

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.040
confusing do you want to understand to

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.119
match planets no because i was like

00:41:31.119 --> 00:41:32.960
i was trying to memorize the day to each

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.720
planet and if you look at it in spanish

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.000
it's actually pretty clear it's like

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
marte's viennese you know mercury all

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.960
that stuff

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.960
um but dude it's so confusing because

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.480
like the way they change and like the

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.079
fact that they'd lose days here and

00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:46.640
gained dude is [ __ ] ridiculous and

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.160
then they'd be like it's festival day

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.839
because there's no like yeah nothing to

00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:51.280
match it up to

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.240
pretty sick dude when people are

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.480
figuring that out yeah so yeah salvador

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.160
domingo is saturday and sunday right

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.440
mm-hmm they're the most fun days of the

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.280
week and the most fun words to say in

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.480
the spanish

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.960
sabudo domingo that's a good time

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.640
i know you're going to have fun true but

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.760
so when the christians when the

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.760
christians split off from the uh from

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.800
the j's

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.079
they were there was a big thing like

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:11.359
what are you doing saturday and you know

00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:12.960
if you were [ __ ] they used to call it

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.280
judaizing they don't know judaizing

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.720
around on saturday you better [ __ ]

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.640
work if you were caught chilling you're

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.640
caught chilling on saturday

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.319
saturday was time for the boys back then

00:42:22.319 --> 00:42:23.040
dude

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.800
if you got caught before the boys they

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.560
when you're early for the boys yeah

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.720
which other saturdays are for the boys

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.160
no sundays are for the goys saturdays

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.480
are for the j's damn yes but let me have

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.000
one that was pretty that was pretty good

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:34.720
though

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.160
but if they caught you if they caught

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.000
you [ __ ] they called it judaizing

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.920
they're like dude he's [ __ ] judaizing

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.200
he's chilling on saturday

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.720
what are some qualities that you would

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.119
think would be considered judaizing they

00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:48.640
were just chilling they were just i know

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.640
but like today observing someone doing

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.040
something give me some ideas that you

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.400
could be like that's you're being you're

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.400
judaizing tipping five percent did i

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.359
ever tell you my theory

00:42:59.359 --> 00:43:02.319
no matter what it's going to be funny

00:43:02.319 --> 00:43:05.920
my theory what krav maga is no

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.520
it's the art it's the art of trying to

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.800
get to someone's testicle so you can

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.119
grab their wallet

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.319
it's just two j's dude [ __ ]

00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:18.160
doing karate you get the wallet just

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.920
like you get you snatch the bacon and

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.440
get to the wallet

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.960
it's just ball grabbing and [ __ ]

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.960
pickpocketing

00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:28.400

of sweet home alabama on

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.960
it looked like they were in like a stage

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.160
they were like they were in like a room

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.599

00:48:03.599 --> 00:48:05.280
have recorded the video like

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.800
years before they were actually playing

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.400

live footage from the show oh okay it

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.160
was like a whole set that they did i

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.079
thought it was like mtv too yeah i've

00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:18.160
seen the free bird from that it's pretty

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.240
tight but the background of their stage

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:23.119
is a giant confederate flag again

00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:24.480
yeah you can't even sing [ __ ] free

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.200

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.200
yeah you think it was pre-meditated did

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.119
they think you were pulling a goof

00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:34.720

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.160
pouring a goofy i didn't know that goofy

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.040

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.119
know they were rocking the flag yeah

00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:42.720
blasting i guess i could have guessed

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.040
that i mean i could have possibly

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.640
surmised there might be a confederate

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.480
flag i didn't i wouldn't think there

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.000
would be i just figured everybody would

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.160
have a good sense of humor about it

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.160

underreported yeah in the 90s

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.960

defending the rape city

00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:45.040
the rape city part didn't bother me

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.200

and i remember being like oh yeah it's

00:56:55.839 --> 00:56:57.599

like men are the devil yeah which you

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.599

a couple of times and it's pretty

01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:34.560
devastating when matthew and i team up

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.440
and

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.440

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.400
it's it's a

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.800
it's the complete will of god that we

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.159
weren't somehow we didn't end up in like

01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:51.840
the cia [ __ ] with like foreign

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.480
countries it'd be so easy at the top of

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.640
foreign governments

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.480
so easy just destabilizing what we did

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.080
america what we did to the bees in the

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.840
wood man they turned on each other dude

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.159
we made them actually not friends

01:15:04.159 --> 01:15:07.920
you puppeteered their downfall yes

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.760
if they started if they started getting

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.199
up we would just absolutely destroy

01:15:11.199 --> 01:15:13.840
morale yeah it was yeah it was easy it

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.120
was easy to make them all you'd have to

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.280
be is like who's red they kind of suck

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.960
oh yeah and then they'd be like it's

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:21.360
[ __ ] six like just right away they

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.159

01:15:24.159 --> 01:15:25.679
dude or we just praise the other guy

01:15:25.679 --> 01:15:26.800

practice

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.360
nice and so she got this [ __ ] chump

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.040
on your team and they'd be like

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.800
well you guys have the classic like you

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.400
know uh

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.320
you know mastermind and then giant

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.840
galoot

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.719
that's

01:15:40.719 --> 01:15:42.960
that's just you know the archetype

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.960
yeah i mean it's a good combo oh yeah

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.920
deadly

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.719
stick him on people

01:15:48.719 --> 01:15:50.320
it's a good operation

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.320
it's also funny because me and matt know

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.600
each other well enough we can see each

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:57.199
other get mad oh yeah i can always tell

01:15:57.199 --> 01:16:00.640
like if matt's going at somebody

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.560
because they can't yeah he's very subtle

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.320
about it you wouldn't know he was

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.560
talking [ __ ] you would just slowly start

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.800
to feel insecure about things do you

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.560
have that thing where if anyone mouths

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.480
off to matt you're like

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.320
you're ready to go definitely but nobody

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.560
does right no rightfully so you're

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.840
you're a unit

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:22.159
yeah someone got me at uh

01:16:22.159 --> 01:16:24.080
