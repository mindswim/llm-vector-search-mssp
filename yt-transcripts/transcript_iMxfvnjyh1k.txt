00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.320
what guys do that's what guys do

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.470
was there any answer on what the place

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.640
was it was like a yo-yo and oh man when

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.779
you guys were like hey does anybody in

00:11:08.779 --> 00:11:10.130
the audience when I come sit on Santa's

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.079
lap she stood up right away I was like

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:15.800
whoo yes she got up to the stage was

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.360
like I don't have to actually sit on his

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.980
lap do I was like is that what she said

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.440
arias wording that hurts so much

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.779
she goes if she would have said even do

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:28.339
I got to sit on his lap almost like she

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:30.020
thinks at the instruction of the yeah

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.589
bit

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:32.899
it wouldn't hurt as much she goes when

00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:39.529
you ask I don't have to do i well yeh

00:11:39.529 --> 00:11:42.950
you sort of have to like get off the

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.399
stage that's weird today I heard they

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:49.550
changed the CNN thing they put a buddy

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:50.930
they changed the picture Christine said

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.520
oh did that I haven't checked on the

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.930
article they changed the whole thing up

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.640
because someone had to eventually get

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.890
back and say it's ridiculous good for

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.910
CNN's post what is it like CNN had an

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.930
article about like people that were

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.270
cancelled in 2019 and the graphic they

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.220
used for it was our Kelly me and Michael

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.709
J

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:11.809
like what the [ __ ] dude I Texas yeah

00:12:11.809 --> 00:12:13.519
[ __ ] what the [ __ ] were you did with so

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:16.730
much worse guess she's trying to get

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.800
their [ __ ] nuts off but today I just

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.870
got a somebody sent me an article from

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.779
Jezebel that was me and Chappelle so you

00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:27.199
know equally [ __ ] outrageous as far

00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:31.009
as people I shouldn't be next to dude I

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:33.290
mean it makes more sense it's like in

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.470
the world of comedy yeah and no one here

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.790
destroyed anybody's life or anything at

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.959
all so it's like it makes much more

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:41.689
sense but I mean are Kelly and Michael

00:12:41.689 --> 00:12:43.910
first of all the article is about

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.009
cancelling right people who hears

00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:47.209
nothing about people got cancelled this

00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:49.910
year like Michael Jackson he's dead he

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.879
cancelled a monster he died years ago

00:12:54.879 --> 00:12:57.829
then so an off-color jokes the same to

00:12:57.829 --> 00:13:00.980
you as kid touching yes Christine kid

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.699
touching and I guess a child like

00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:07.629
kidnapping and holding them in a house

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:10.519
because I think I was the only one on

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:11.990
there that was actually guilty of the

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:22.189
crime though so crazy wild look at you

00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:23.779
really wild but they did change the

00:13:23.779 --> 00:13:25.879
image you're the only black person and

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:27.439
the list of they're not carrying an

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:33.110
umbrella to keep son off of them when

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.149
you reach that level black will you ever

00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:37.370
start carrying a son umbrella it's not

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.329
we know something's wrong with you

00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:39.649
that's he could tell black man's going

00:13:39.649 --> 00:13:41.209
through it he's just carrying a son

00:13:41.209 --> 00:13:42.699
umbrella

00:13:42.699 --> 00:13:44.899
black man carries a Sun umbrella he's

00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:46.249
got something something dirties going on

00:13:46.249 --> 00:13:48.949
oh yeah you and mr. Bentley he killed

00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:50.779
his sister-in-law or something something

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:54.769
crazy happened but that's such CNN again

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:58.540
such irresponsible [ __ ] what's the

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.269
what's the call that by the way if

00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:06.129
you're just going with the theme it's

00:14:06.129 --> 00:14:14.870
Weinstein yeah his jokes Lou Pearlman's

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.610
I got someone photoshopped it when I

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.100
they first sent it to me I thought you

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.629
did when are you posted it and then I

00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:21.059
had

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:23.159
look yeah it's crazy yeah I thought

00:14:23.159 --> 00:14:24.089
you're just trying to be funny

00:14:24.089 --> 00:14:25.769
no man I actually was like I think

00:14:25.769 --> 00:14:27.389
[ __ ] kidding me yeah I was honestly

00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:36.379
pretty excited about it though yes

speaking of she and other pedophiles I

00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:43.279
started watching Falcone

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:45.989

00:14:47.729 --> 00:14:49.469
half hour of an hour and a half of it

just money probs well I mean look I

00:15:09.329 --> 00:15:10.709
don't know anything about this so maybe

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:12.569
this guy didn't do anything wrong but if

00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:14.159
you're gonna be a pedophile that's into

00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:16.409

where I'm at now is they're all starting

00:16:01.979 --> 00:16:03.959
to hate him because he would just create

00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:05.459
his own competition to make money off of

00:16:05.459 --> 00:16:06.629

00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:13.349
them and put them all together and then

00:16:13.349 --> 00:16:14.549

00:16:14.549 --> 00:16:18.169

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:29.130

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.470
though you are choosing with a guy who's

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.810
like a dancer a boy band guy yeah

I'm not saying they can't be tough but

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.140
they're it's not what your instinct

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.460
would be if you're if you're attracted

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:39.600
that you're not attracted to like the

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.900
masculine qualities of a guy if you

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.090
really are the way he dances is that you

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.080
know I mean it's all that even if you

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.140
find that sexiest [ __ ] that he dances

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.490
when you're walking down a dark street

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:51.780
you look at them and go like we should

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.370

it was like the reality of like it's yes

01:07:31.729 --> 01:07:33.049
it's kind of like similar to what's

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.849
going on even though it was more

01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:36.139
ridiculous than because he's such a

01:07:36.139 --> 01:07:39.199
character what he's doing and he got all

01:07:39.199 --> 01:07:41.119
this flak for Tegan and they protested

01:07:41.119 --> 01:07:42.499
they took the movie out of the theaters

01:07:42.499 --> 01:07:45.359

01:07:48.839 --> 01:07:50.880
Fairlane I still love it but it was out

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:52.259
of the I think he just kind of had that

01:07:52.259 --> 01:07:54.480
he was going through a thing of like oh

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.210
like you know a much grander sky told

01:07:57.210 --> 01:07:58.680
you I mean Christine had a fight a fight

01:07:58.680 --> 01:07:59.789
on the air one time on our radio show

01:07:59.789 --> 01:08:02.069

01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:04.499
Florida because him you know Christine

01:08:04.499 --> 01:08:05.430
you know I didn't like the way he was

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:07.140
like arguing like come on man like

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.819
you're enjoying the show as like a Pete

01:08:08.819 --> 01:08:10.769
you know I mean so I think it got real

01:08:10.769 --> 01:08:11.880
to him that like some people are

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:12.900
actually going like you're a monster

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.539
piece of [ __ ] causing problems the world

01:08:15.539 --> 01:08:16.710
he's just like I'm just being like a

01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:19.049
goofy okay yeah it's a bummer when that

01:08:19.049 --> 01:08:20.819
happen yeah and he just showed us he

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:22.440
just showed his hands and like cried on

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:25.500
the thing and like they just but his

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.799
thing was so character that it was like

01:08:27.799 --> 01:08:30.509
they kind of like put him didn't like

01:08:30.509 --> 01:08:32.909
stifle his career like I'm financially

01:08:32.909 --> 01:08:34.259
I'm sure and he was always his name was

01:08:34.259 --> 01:08:36.420
just as big but like he had like rien

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.100
not reinvent but like kind of go through

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.350
a phase and come back strong again you

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:41.130
know I mean it's really

01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:43.049
it was weird everyone had to forget that

01:08:43.049 --> 01:08:44.429
he did the sitcom for a while it was

01:08:44.429 --> 01:08:46.589
very not him he was like a mailman or

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:48.600
something like that it was odd it was

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:51.630
really a weird transition for him he

01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:53.520
comes down that much your mails over

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.609
here now dice it's done a better job at

01:08:56.609 --> 01:08:59.730
staying cool in that regard than Marilyn

01:08:59.730 --> 01:09:01.920
Manson has Marilyn Manson was like that

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.839
evil and dangerous and like it's tough

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:06.080
to stay it's not the dice is dangerous

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.699
anymore but like he'd still do comedy at

01:09:08.699 --> 01:09:10.940
a high level

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:14.639
Marilyn Manson is just a laughable I'm

01:09:14.639 --> 01:09:16.139
such an art piece at one point of his

01:09:16.139 --> 01:09:17.489
life and now he's just like a goofball

01:09:17.489 --> 01:09:19.139
wearing a [ __ ] vest yeah there's

01:09:19.139 --> 01:09:20.009
stuff like that when they're like

01:09:20.009 --> 01:09:22.560
characters you get older like that when

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:25.259
it ages out they become jokes yeah you

01:09:25.259 --> 01:09:26.580
know what I mean it's a weird thing to

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:27.929
sit like like all those [ __ ] boy

01:09:27.929 --> 01:09:29.279
bands like every one of them now you

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:31.619
look at me like [ __ ] losers oh you my

01:09:31.619 --> 01:09:33.330
every girl every girl that you liked was

01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:35.279
[ __ ] in love with them yeah you know

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:37.909
I mean yep so Christine our age gap

01:09:37.909 --> 01:09:40.170
shows a lot of those things that like

01:09:40.170 --> 01:09:42.719
she can't remember when like so-and-so

01:09:42.719 --> 01:09:44.310
wasn't a joke when it was just the

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:46.319
coolest thing you know like that sets

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:48.179
our eight year age gap it's that a lot

01:09:48.179 --> 01:09:51.060
well that's like the Dane Cook that he

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.489
became a joke right and for a while and

01:09:53.489 --> 01:09:55.020
it's like I got in the comedy and was

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.940
told he was a joke by like you know

01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.170
bitter comics

01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:00.239
because I came into going like I mean

01:10:00.239 --> 01:10:02.760
he's like the best one for sure some

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:06.960
last cut was so good but there was that

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.550
and then he did a comics come home I

01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:10.290
think it was where like everyone was

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:12.120
eating [ __ ] on it yeah but you were at

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.410
the cellar at the time I he was doing

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:14.699
like tourgasm that's when he was at the

01:10:14.699 --> 01:10:15.900
height of it right

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:19.140
I was open forum know open forum of

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.400
Caroline's when you come through still

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.730
doing clubs but sold out seven shows you

01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:25.230
know through the week yeah but then he

01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:26.610
moves on to the theaters after that and

01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:27.870
actually Rick I think went right to

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:30.330
arenas almost yeah now he came back and

01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:34.260
did the theater at the garden 5000 seats

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.960
or something like that yeah and then he

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.949
by the theater that he's one right two

01:10:37.949 --> 01:10:39.660
arenas but I mean like it was pretty

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:40.679
quick in that regard

01:10:40.679 --> 01:10:42.480
yeah it's funny too buddy no you know

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.340

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.949
be like you know Aziz Ansari but in sees

01:10:46.949 --> 01:10:48.810

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:51.360
coming up there like he was like started

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.679
after me I believe and as someone who

01:10:52.679 --> 01:10:54.630
just kind of goes and who's this kid his

01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:56.340
open mic kids doing what now he's fine

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:57.690
he's famous like yeah

01:10:57.690 --> 01:11:00.120
it hits weird like my age would have

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.560
more bitterness towards that were a new

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.030
person coming goes nah he's been killing

01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:05.010

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.409
to bring out Crocodile Dundee he and

01:12:31.409 --> 01:12:32.880

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.860
Marty now Crocodile Dundee he was

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.119
getting ready to yeah [ __ ] he had to be

01:12:36.119 --> 01:12:37.889
in the back light yeah this is a bad

01:12:37.889 --> 01:12:40.260
time for me come on what are you [ __ ]

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.849
in he's over that idea where would you

01:12:41.849 --> 01:12:45.389
things are asked infinite ease you

01:12:45.389 --> 01:12:49.380
poofed he goes into the audience and

01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:51.119
does like a great talk show Bill Maher

01:12:51.119 --> 01:12:52.679
did it wants to like do I got a handle

01:12:52.679 --> 01:12:54.360
this [ __ ] myself and then like a

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.400
goofball in a suit goes over and starts

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.510
eating yelling that you look you're in

01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:58.019
the streets

01:12:58.019 --> 01:12:59.699
it's like Johnny Carson coming into

01:12:59.699 --> 01:13:01.860
Kersey he will help ya and that's what

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.269
happens these gay guys start yelling out

01:13:03.269 --> 01:13:13.979
so play this we could jump the blind

01:13:13.979 --> 01:13:15.360
grows so funny while they were singing

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.939
it she said she said oh my god it was so

01:13:17.939 --> 01:13:20.269
funny

01:13:20.269 --> 01:13:25.340
Jacob you love everything I'm sorry

01:13:31.239 --> 01:13:33.469
I'm sorry why don't I have any gay

01:13:33.469 --> 01:13:35.570
guests on my show cuz they're all

01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:37.730
sucking each other off outside it's

01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:41.239
Hollywood you really don't like to talk

01:13:41.239 --> 01:13:43.130
about this sexual preference so we don't

01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:47.960
know whether they're gay or not by the

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:51.020
way that [ __ ] logic it really didn't

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:57.290
go good it's true you're one gay guys

01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:58.699
definitely the more militant and the

01:13:58.699 --> 01:14:00.350
other one go little super was painted

01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:01.730
belly and he goes I just thought we were

01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:03.949
gonna meet in my belly dude and you

01:14:03.949 --> 01:14:05.060
joined it you told me this was a sound

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:06.920
argument and he just he poked a lot of

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.750
holes in it punk a lot of holes and it's

01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:10.070
funny the audience reacts like that

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:13.580
though like nowadays if the crowd was so

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.160
quick to be against them if this was

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.290
right now I swear to god they would sail

01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:20.090
those two they'd be internet superstars

01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:28.310
they'd have a talk show yeah this ain't

01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:29.660
Merc you didn't think I'd run from this

01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:30.310
did you

01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:32.600

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.070
and I'm gonna deal with it I know white

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:35.180
boy it's what he's telling you

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:38.630
I know corny ass white boy don't take
