00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.590
minutes have gone by um I don't like at

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.230

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.770
just churning out [ __ ] and that half of

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.770
my material now is just like stuff I'm

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.570
[ __ ] around with in New York that

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.150
like is just like it's funny Jesus got

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.610
killed it's funny like all this stuff

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.050
like I was once a to talking about how

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.900
like I had a decent chunk on Harvey

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.370
Weinstein right now that's just like

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.350
different kinda defending him like after

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.110
fending Harvey and people are just

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.060
unhappy not happy with that normal

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.500
people are like what the [ __ ]

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.210
you know what the [ __ ] going on did I

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.470
tell you about the Harvey stuff no

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.370
thanks fine just Harvey like alright so

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.590
he offered movie roles in exchange for

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.160
sexual favors mm-hmm the women for the

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.220
most part took the roles sure do you

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.050
think that like Harvey afterwards was

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.820
like when all the women started coming

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.390
out was he like what the [ __ ] I thought

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.320
we had something

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.510
same like a deal no but I mean like do

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.560
you think Harvey thought he was like a

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.840
ladies man I thought he was like he was

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.460
like walking around like yeah I [ __ ]

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.030
her not a big deal all these options

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.950
Hughes literally name it although idea

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.350
was a rapist true he was just like what

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.120
that's what you do you give them

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.560
something and then you [ __ ] them they

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.090
thought yeah that's how they were my

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.800
girlfriends they are all my girlfriends

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.060
and then a a each one of them was like

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.580
baby who was the one that he liked he

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.229
put one aside at like a restaurant

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.020
jerked off in like a wine cellar Oh sick

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.790
who's the one who like froze up I'll

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.500
move who's one who froze up on him I

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.390
don't know there's someone who came out

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.000
that was just like I want yeah maybe

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.770
Harvey Weinstein I went to his place and

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.360
then I just I froze when I was there I

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.270
totally froze up it was like someone

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.950
they don't they were like they had been

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.010
famous too yeah that was like and I

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.750
don't know again this is this is a weird

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.490
thing to get into like defending these

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.760
people but it's like some of these women

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.360
I mean you took the job and the argument

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.740
is like yeah you'd get blacklisted if

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.360
you spoke out or things like that so I

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.010
mean there's definitely validity there

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.340
but it

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.550
like if you took the job and got paid

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.180
for it

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.340
you kind of perpetuated that same

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.210
horrible thing to happen to somebody

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:58.580
else after you yeah sucks now you can't

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.169
even talk about a situation without of

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:01.220
having them being like oh you're

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.020
standing up for him it's like that's

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.940
like no no no typically the truth lays

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.889
like you know between scenarios again if

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:08.690
obviously guy was probably abusing his

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.580
power what exactly percent abusing is

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.010
but what exactly was he abusing and what

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.290
part of you know your weird power surge

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.669
was playing into that like dude yeah

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.830
this is acting bro it's not life and

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.139
death so it's almost like if some guy

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:22.639
was like you gotta suck my dick you're

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.200
not getting on MADtv I'd be like I don't

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.410
need to be on MADtv yeah that's kind of

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.150
how the joke ends yeah yeah if Lorne

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.800
Michaels walked in here right now and

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.400
was like if if you let me titty [ __ ] you

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.350
you're back on the cast I'd take it in a

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.330
second dude I'd let Lauren titty [ __ ] me

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:50.900
in front all you I don't know man it's

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.220
like what part of those women's mind

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.500
like is it total fear is it like I need

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.000
you I don't know I need to bone smells

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.750
matte what how dare you I'm dude as a

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.510
man you have a different brain where do

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.889
you chill

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:08.840
do we have the same brains yeah awesome

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.660
lady brains I don't know I think women

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.070
it push for like that we need more like

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.750
female psychology and it's like we need

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.460
more like female-centered psychology

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.490
it's like why I thought we have the same

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.139
brains what's going on do we have the

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:26.750
same brains I'm Boston women yeah no I

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.490
don't think so no right wasn't that

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.669
where does testosterone come from uh I

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:33.260
don't know I think it comes from like

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.849
our bellies kind of but I think it comes

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:36.169
from like glands but yeah I don't I

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.580
don't think we have oh that's it gets

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.039
sent out from your brain yeah I mean I

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.450
think we have very similar brains but I

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.720
think our uh who knows you don't know I

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.160
think our corpus callosum is like a

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.100
little wider yeah that's what I thought

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.959
or you worry with neuroscience but I

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:55.070
think we have like kind of I want to get

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.920
into the neuroscience JibJab but uh yeah

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.140
and then basically dude if you had a

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.630
movie script mm-hmm in your back pocket

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.480
sure you're not tossing that out to

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.910
somebody trying to get some head I mean

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.440
that's kind of if you're so if you're

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.880
the dieter that you're the person I

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.470
wouldn't but I'm just asking

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.670
well here's the other thing too it's

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.010
like imagine how much head you already

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.570
got

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.220
he must have he loved head yeah so he

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.510
probably was getting lots of head than

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.570
being like all right so now I get head

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.000
now as I gave you oh yeah or again he

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.700
was just out here lightly raping people

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.220
which I see lately because it's more of

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.800
like a tit-for-tat yeah it wasn't like a

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.120
doors open but it wasn't like the

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.850
intense rape yeah like yeah he's got a

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.140
guy out of he's not a guy hopping out of

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.060
a bush he's a guy he's a guy that you

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.589
came to his hotel room and he offered

00:09:42.589 --> 00:09:44.420
you ten million dollars to suck his dick

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.220
he's like a would you okay

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.450
he's like a living breathing would you

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:51.950
rather and I was like dude if he was if

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.500
he was attractive we'd all be like those

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.300
[ __ ] took that role that wasn't right

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.920
but he's so ugly that everyone's like

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.870
that was definitely rape there's no way

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.520
those woman those women wanted to [ __ ]

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.350
that guy shrill you know that's a fair

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.180
point well he was hot there's always my

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.500
favorite argument was like if somebody

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.060
accused somebody of rape they picked

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.100
it's just cuz he's ugly if it was Brad

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:20.480
Pitt you'd be all about it you were

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.920
sexually attracted to him you wouldn't

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.320
be calling it right yeah that's how it

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.740
works

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.390
and if there's such an attractive guy

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.220
raped you even though I didn't steal it

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.899
I still got raped for sure but if he was

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:32.270
hot and he was like you have to [ __ ] me

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.589
or take this role the bigger I'll [ __ ]

00:10:33.589 --> 00:10:35.270
you and then do the rolled over great

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:42.079
yeah look I think there were plenty of

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:43.880
women who didn't take the [ __ ] deal

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.820
and he still did him I'll [ __ ] I'd the

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.770
one that the one story is a girl like at

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.440
a restaurant in front of everyone

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.510
yeah he like followed her down to like a

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.730
wine cellar or some [ __ ] mm-hmm and like

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.850
cornered her and was like I don't know I

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.110
mean I don't know exactly what he said

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.400
but I think he ended up

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.740
think he asks for a head she said no and

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.940
he was like do you mind if I just like

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.040
jerk off something like that

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.890
sure yeah and she complained and didn't

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.690
take the role what happened to him when

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.250
she complained I don't know I think it's

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.420
probably got in trouble

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.160
I think the Weinstein brothers probably

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.779
tried to bury her what's his brother up

00:11:17.779 --> 00:11:20.810
to pure damage control right now

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.360
probably just like Jesus Christ RV yeah

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.529
because there's a lot of you know yeah

00:11:24.529 --> 00:11:25.700

on it

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.779
pretty much the gist of it all so

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:48.140
obviously again people's code yeah I'm

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.580
just you're again you're not up there

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.230
being like well a couple minutes hey

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.089
it's got little women you're not in

00:12:53.089 --> 00:12:54.860
court trying to offend him it's [ __ ]

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.930
with people I swear to god man I think

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.910
it lost just again I just was watching a

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.260
punch line this weekend but I think

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.220
there's a lot of people go to calm you

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.870
now it's like a like a oh my god what's

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.339
gonna happen and you can even people go

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:08.360
now just to be like no yeah okay dude

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.940
which is cool that's actually kind of

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.130
good it is kind of some good aspects of

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:13.730
that way

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.180
it is back to being exciting it is

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.040
exciting to do stand-up so the part

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.240
where you're not allowed to say things

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.459
actually does kind of help yeah you know

00:13:22.459 --> 00:13:24.230
that's true if it was socially

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.750
acceptable to say everything comedy

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.149
would kind of be okay it would be as

00:13:29.149 --> 00:13:30.709
exciting I mean there's still a bro

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:34.089
you'd have to fall down onstage I'm a

00:13:34.089 --> 00:13:39.199
purist lack of vaudeville no I mean

00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:40.610
obviously there's tons of comics that

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.790
can do it the other way clean where you

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.560
can say clean stuff yes still great but

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.190
I don't I'm not that smart

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.570
you're just twisted but I'm so [ __ ]

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.339
twisted but I'm twisted too I'm

00:13:52.339 --> 00:13:54.290
attractive I'm attracted to the profane

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.329
yeah my fault dude what do you think

00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:58.550
that is typically people who have liked

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:03.139
emotional disturbances you could track

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:05.750
it to like weirdly profane yeah I enjoy

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.149
watching a stranger get upset something

00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:09.829
they're not allowed to be upset you

00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:11.630
can't get upset about words so that when

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.160
it happens and somebody gets upset it's

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.079
like oh it's also funny cuz most people

00:14:15.079 --> 00:14:16.820
can say [ __ ] and I was like [ __ ]

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.860
weird but like yeah some people don't

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.930
have the benefit of being it's a benefit

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.550
slash curves to be able to enjoy life in

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.480
the periphery where you just watch

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.279
yourself and be like let's hope some

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:27.380
people see things they're like oh my god

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.300
like what he heard Michael Michael Vick

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.160
had like a dog thing when he was [ __ ]

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.019
with dogs I heard that I just

00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:34.220
experienced stuff like that cerebral

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.019
Rome it's kind of like thought he was

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:37.490
fighting dogs - [ __ ] up someone would

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:38.990
like bring me in there and I saw the

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.300
dogs I feel horrible but I can read

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.399
headlines and be like hilarious and then

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:44.959
you know listen to people like that's a

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:46.040
big thing right now how they're trying

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.170
to let him back in or something they're

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.880
people like they're saying it's a racial

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.410
issue now well they're like pretty much

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.490
it's only white people who are mad about

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.899
the dogs black people are like yo dude

00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:55.970
like is what it is get the [ __ ] over it

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.769
I was watching I was listening to on the

00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:59.410
radio they're talking about that yeah I

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.730
think this is the problem white people

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:02.930
have is they got to get over this uh

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.089
they better get over dog fighting yeah

00:15:05.089 --> 00:15:07.790
bro yeah but they're saying it was like

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.490
he grew up where dog fighting was chill

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.350
like obviously you if you grew up with a

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:13.610
dog fight he wasn't chillier i'ma get

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.319
what the [ __ ] you guys doing cuz I could

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:17.300
say you know I was blown up like if they

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.769
were like you if you ever blew up a cat

00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:20.420
fish's head with a firework you're a bad

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.209
person I'd be like everybody was [ __ ]

00:15:23.209 --> 00:15:26.620
doing it around me yeah so I'm team did

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.630
well I am too it I want the glorious

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.880
return also it's like he already had his

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.320
glorious return when he came back with

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.060
the Eagles and bawled out exactly but I

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.010
think they're trying to like do did you

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.720
really the big J story about that what

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.820
[ __ ] he got in trouble for that where it

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.940
was like I'm not doing the joke justice

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.150
but he did a late-night spot and they're

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.860
like you can't do that Michael Vick joke

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.170
and he just went out and did the Michael

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.580
Vick justice and the Michael Vick joke

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.820
was like before he got in trouble like

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.960
when he got in trouble I was like that

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.390
piece of [ __ ] yeah and then he signed to

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.980
the Eagles and I was like dude I'll toss

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.050
him any dog he wants to [ __ ] killed

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.520
and now he's an eagle I think something

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:10.030
like that yeah that's so funny

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.200
why would you get upset about that

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.570
though yeah because you got the man big

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.640
J pointing out are like basic

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.950
instinctual like yeah what is there a

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.630
part of a little Smeagol and all of us

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.120
dude it's like yes obviously yeah but

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.260
yeah the people don't think about that

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.550
people think about it and they're like

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.380
what what a horrible thing would I do -

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.750
I was thinking about our stalking abrini

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.160
about we have a parking spot right now

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.030
did I talk about this

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.800
no leave a parking spot on front of our

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.230
house and it's like we there's someone

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.760
who lives across the street from us they

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.200
don't have a car but they have the spot

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.300
comes with air place so we're renting it

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.160
off and we're paying them so now she has

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.890
a boyfriend and things are getting

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.360
serious and I'm like this [ __ ]

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.700

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.320
spot [ __ ] up was I want this spot for

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.760
the next like five years I need that

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.370
dude Parkway see how good it is it's

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.510
like pretty cheap for the month it's

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.490
awesome so I thought we pulled up in it

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:58.720
the one day I was with me and Brent and

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.090
uh we pull up in the parking spot and

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.350
she's like how nice is this parking spot

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.080
I'm like honestly like if no one knew

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.030
about it I would kill her we date we've

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.410
like ate dinner at their place together

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.780
I was like I'd kill that guy literally I

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.820
would slit his throat just so we could

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.320
still have his big butt and I was like

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.750
thinking about it I was like I mean I

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.430
feel so bad saying this but he's a nice

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.760
dude I'm like dude if he died I part of

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.090
me would be like oh my god man part the

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:26.740
Smeagol part now I know it because I

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.980

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.370
a nice guy by the way I love it I want

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:34.300
you to live and thrive

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.580
Matt what I want you to know that this

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.330
is the exact

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.730
attitude that led the German people took

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:40.770
being

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.420
it just as guilty during the Holocaust

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.700
as any of the Nazis sure we're all

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.190
sitting around like look I love my

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.380
neighbors but if they were gone and I

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.150
got to take all their stuff that'd be

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.760
pretty sweet

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.350
how is every German oh that lives in

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.030
everybody dude yeah that lives in

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.770
everybody do durman's have just moved

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.170
into Jewish houses during that yeah

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.820
during the Holocaust

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.830
Jeremie family would just take the Jews

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.960
would get evicted and sent somewhere

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.460
yeah and just a German family would be

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.440
like oh nice I'm really sick house

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.720
imagine here now if your neighbor got

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.980
kicked out and that was like dude I've

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.140
been scheming on this lot forever near

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.300
my house and they just like abducted two

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.440
dudes who hung out there and like you

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.559
know if you want this I'd be like I mean

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.490
there's not much I can do it's

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.820
definitely take this a lot again people

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.350
who claim that they'd be the first ones

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.929
a rally against it I'm like okay yeah

00:18:31.929 --> 00:18:34.179
sure yeah would you would you really and

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:36.700
again even if this is a [ __ ] up

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.470
thought yeah we'll get in trouble Luke's

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:39.670
here whatever we're not gonna get any

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.130
more trouble but uh I wonder how many of

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.530
those you know women's March Pride

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.000
Parade [ __ ] would would all those

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.320
marchers that would be out there if

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.750
there was an actual consequence I wonder

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.370
how many would be out there what do you

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:52.600
mean you know I mean don't even were the

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.520
consequence the [ __ ] dude if there

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.230
were consequences oh like there were you

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.760
know like where there were when you

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.320
would actually protest and resist a

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.730
government gotcha how many of those

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:01.809
marches would be out there

00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:03.490
I wonder if AT&T would be in the front

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.520
like hey oh yeah dude that's a good

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.900
question because I think the women's

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.520
marchers been falling off significantly

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.830
they think that one yeah but I think the

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.330
numbers have been low do it anytime

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.059
every on the day after the anniversary

00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:19.210
of his inauguration his hey we don't say

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.340
we only say his pronoun exact although I

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.809
hate to assume that's his preferred

00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:25.600
pronoun yeah hey to be presumptive true

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.730
but oh you can tell by his talks I can

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:34.510
tell by how toxic yang energies are yang

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.460
yang energy dominator that's how you get

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.800
sassy it's Donna you've become a big

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:46.570
daddy true that is a good point and dude

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.010
yeah the woman's March has been falling

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.850
off pretty hard yeah my [ __ ] grabs back

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:53.809
Matt for sure bro

00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:56.539
I [ __ ] stinks my [ __ ] it's a [ __ ]

00:19:56.539 --> 00:20:08.719
monster my [ __ ] is a pothole do my

00:20:08.719 --> 00:20:11.559
[ __ ] is a pothole

00:20:12.969 --> 00:20:15.469
but then you know what Matt that's very

00:20:15.469 --> 00:20:17.179
insensitive to the women whose taints

00:20:17.179 --> 00:20:19.700
exploded giving birth and it was in fact

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.989
did we were talking about birth I was at

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:25.909
the child birthing class yeah you got

00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:27.229
one coming up I've been going to jail

00:20:27.229 --> 00:20:29.119
Terry I went to a child birthing class

00:20:29.119 --> 00:20:30.559
you were watching footage of births

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:32.269
I saw dude I saw it oh my god I forgot

00:20:32.269 --> 00:20:34.639
about this yes so we watched this video

00:20:34.639 --> 00:20:36.679
we had to go to classes oh the one they

00:20:36.679 --> 00:20:38.809
showed a video of like a lot of those

00:20:38.809 --> 00:20:40.429
but I have a theory that a lot of those

00:20:40.429 --> 00:20:42.440
child birthing classes well they are led

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.179
by au pairs and we're gonna Auto pairs

00:20:44.179 --> 00:20:47.659
they're called doulas so like the person

00:20:47.659 --> 00:20:48.919
teaching the class I think are on the

00:20:48.919 --> 00:20:50.690
slide kind of sell you into the idea of

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.669
like hire some doulas hire some help ah

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:54.529
whatever you know like I'm not knocking

00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:57.710
him but something I picked up on but we

00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:59.330

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.280
wide as the bottom of this cop dude do

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.390
you ever get one of those when it's just

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.850

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.530

go like straight to your house and beg

00:27:26.499 --> 00:27:27.849

but um uh you this is disappointing

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.240
coming from you cuz usually you tweet

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.150
stuff I agree with he got the Stephen

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.860
King I like a lot of his stuff for sure

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.600
but he got broke pretty hard by the

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.820
Trump dog yeah he was one of the guys

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.700
who got broken in half like that dude he

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.260
had to have been conscious of what would

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.500
be the reaction to his tweet I think I

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.580
think it happened for a lot of these

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.320
people so when Trump came into office

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.790
and they all freaked out and started

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.410
like if you just tweeted like orange

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:14.970
pieces [ __ ] yeah

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.550
wait I got 20,000 likes on that yeah

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.080

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.820
[ __ ] just swinging harder tap in yeah

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.410
and it's like now you just locked into

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.840
this world of like yeah identity

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.179
politics is now your life too it's soft

00:30:51.179 --> 00:30:53.220
that's that's a rough place to be in it

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:53.850
stinks

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.040
that stinks imagine getting into

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.270
stand-up and then you end up being like

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.360
a political guy that's like folk

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.940
yeah well it's funny to guys like it'll

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.529
take immigration which is like a highly

00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:04.970
complex issue it's like nobody knows

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.139
what it would be like if we were just

00:31:06.139 --> 00:31:08.629
like alright let's [ __ ] open it up

00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:10.669
you guys are right for it and then like

00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:12.739
things start going bad it's like dude

00:31:12.739 --> 00:31:14.450
the [ __ ] that would happen that could go

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.940
bad it's like people are being like oh

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.249
yeah you should totally just let like

00:31:19.249 --> 00:31:20.690
millions like what the [ __ ] could happen

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.039
it's yeah I don't [ __ ] know to you

00:31:22.039 --> 00:31:24.379
and said it's just like very like split

00:31:24.379 --> 00:31:26.119
issue or it's like yeah you're the Ford

00:31:26.119 --> 00:31:27.110
or you're against it it's like well

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.899
let's sure what are all the [ __ ]

00:31:29.899 --> 00:31:32.330
available it's like look legal

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.309
immigration seems to be the correct

00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:37.119
answer no you know just if I was like

00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:39.169
figuring it out now obviously I think

00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:40.759
there might be problems I don't know

00:31:40.759 --> 00:31:43.070
anything so when I say [ __ ] it's this is

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:46.580
nothing but like if you're for legal

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.190
immigration mm-hmm maybe just figure out

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.169
how to haste in that process so people

00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:52.940
aren't stuck in this waiting game of

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.789
like you know eight years before they

00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:58.190
can get into the country yeah I think

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:59.779
that's kind of the answer I don't know

00:31:59.779 --> 00:32:02.389
though well the my problem is that I was

00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:03.830
traditionally like when I was like 23

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.330
the type of person who would like look

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:06.529
you in the eye and be like we shouldn't

00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:08.269
even have countries bro yeah of course

00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:11.029
so it's like I got to I got to live that

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:13.460
mentality out over a decade and I just

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.809
learned all these lessons they're like

00:32:14.809 --> 00:32:16.970
it's kind of a dumb simplistic way to

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:18.950
look at things I mean obviously yeah we

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.139
cool if we all super evolved over all

00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:22.549
this stuff which is probably the end

00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:24.470
goal but like probably a bunch of little

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:25.759
stepping stones hit along the way so

00:32:25.759 --> 00:32:27.499
it's like I got to like first-hand

00:32:27.499 --> 00:32:29.330
experience why living like that doesn't

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.460
really work very well so I hear people

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.539
hitting that kind of stuff me like

00:32:32.539 --> 00:32:34.879
that's all you do it's like you figured

00:32:34.879 --> 00:32:36.049
out you read all the books and you

00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:37.460
figured it out just figure it out yeah

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:38.929
okay it's like that's cool

00:32:38.929 --> 00:32:40.100
and then if anyone opposes it you're

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.330
like [ __ ] racist and it's like

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.129
alright it's not a good that's

00:32:43.129 --> 00:32:44.539
definitely not a good way to figure out

00:32:44.539 --> 00:32:46.970
how to plan yeah that's sorry I digress

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.039
yeah true I mean we're getting political

00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:52.159
the right the right wing's equally is is

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:54.109
like just like they're gonna take our

00:32:54.109 --> 00:32:57.109
jobs all right slow down that also

00:32:57.109 --> 00:33:00.049
happens everywhere what when like anyone

00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:01.580
new comes in you're like our jobs really

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.679
yeah yeah yeah whatever

00:33:03.679 --> 00:33:06.619
I'm talking about forget the outsiders

00:33:06.619 --> 00:33:08.629
true yeah I got I got ya I got in to see

00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:11.809
you King that's why oh yeah but yeah

00:33:11.809 --> 00:33:13.050
that's scene where

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:15.240
so they're in episode 3 you're watching

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.190

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.390
every [ __ ] movie does this where

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.100
there's a fight scene and the fight is

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.470
good yeah that's not how fights are

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:57.270
should be pure walls ever just they

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.040
should look at worlds armed and so this

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.179

swings at him and he literally does the

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:20.070
most ridiculous karate dude karate

drive my friend need to do that in

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:18.810
college you would have a he I was a ball

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:20.400
of psychology than a business major and

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.110
he was a finance major and he'd have his

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:23.880
finance boys over and he would pour them

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.970
he would bring like like regular rum and

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:28.170
he bigger I'll make everyone shots and

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.490
he would be giving like one one or two

people at a time just 151 so we'd all be

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.750
taking regular shots and a couple people

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:40.500
take 150 but you would see like you

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.850
would see that you know he like I gave

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:43.140
it to him in him so we don't take a shot

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.150
and we'd watch two of them like like

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.130

fill up about like literally six shots

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.530
into a glass and then it's like chug

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.330
shake six shots real quick and then I go

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.860
to a bar and I get so cool by the time

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.970

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.610
nowhere yeah it's like dude that's

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:31.200
[ __ ] crazy I remember that they like

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.490
yeah there's a trick you don't even have

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.260
to spend money at the bar you just chug

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.770
a fifth of vodka before you

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.930
[ __ ] throw up a bar oh yeah then I

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.150
would go in to spend $200 for some ham

my [ __ ] biceps are getting jacked is

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:12.099
like when you do cardio like new veins

00:45:12.099 --> 00:45:13.780

blood to flow through your body it's

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:25.300
really important to do that I really I

not wanted the industry made that very

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:33.539
clear as soon as the entire industry

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.059

on the [ __ ] Comedy Cellar podcast

00:48:13.049 --> 00:48:15.059
that's why I went to [ __ ] graduate

00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:16.529
school you were about your organism you

00:48:16.529 --> 00:48:17.670
were up in New York you learned about

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:19.199
communism you went to New York that

00:48:19.199 --> 00:48:20.999
podcast came out right around the time

00:48:20.999 --> 00:48:23.249
you were up doing the realize that Matt

00:48:23.249 --> 00:48:23.969
came up with it

00:48:23.969 --> 00:48:26.969
we all kinases

00:48:26.969 --> 00:48:29.130
I just have read my school stuff I'm

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:30.749

yeah that's my Clark Kent you should go

00:48:38.279 --> 00:48:39.959
on and out will come be like well that's

00:48:39.959 --> 00:48:42.269
kind of problematic yeah I think I could

00:48:42.269 --> 00:48:44.130
out whoa come on a lot of stuff

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:46.530
yeah they'll be pretty fun but honestly

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:48.990
it actually kind of reminds me of if you

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:51.750
ever talked to like a priest mm-hmm

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:53.850

they've been literally training for

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.300
years in a school for hours every day to

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.920
give you answers yeah but they're pretty

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.390
easy to break up because like you hit

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:05.730
them with like real life stuff you like

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:06.990

that like you're not allowed to like

think about any of the little snags or

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:13.590
loopholes so there's so many snags and

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:14.670
loopholes when you bring them up they're

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:16.440

because of how expensive your school is

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:51.180

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.119
[ __ ] awesome dude that's where I

00:55:42.119 --> 00:55:45.160
before the one live cast we did I did

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.119

gonna like [ __ ] your trans saw your

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:54.069
regular that's what I came up with the

00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:55.960
theory that trans people are the like

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.460
they're just totally gonna connect human

00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:02.950
sexuality so but like low tank like

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.620
coming out of a float tank on weed and

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:51.120
mushrooms the [ __ ] dude it'll do it

00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:52.860
walking down a road would be [ __ ]

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:54.690
hilarious so funny and it's like they're

00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:56.310
the crowd there's gonna be pretty

00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:58.710
[ __ ] skinned as well so this is going

00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:01.230
up on we just kind of froze this doobie

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:03.090
it'll be a fun event to videotape I mean

00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:06.900
[ __ ] corny bro you say that dude you

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:08.520
say that you say that about booze dude

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.740
booze rules booze isn't corny Bruce is

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.090
fun I just think it's inherently

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:13.500
destructive and you know it doesn't

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.180
really I don't know doesn't have the

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:18.330
sinners don't get stuff done true that's

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:20.160
true when they don't use it properly you

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.400
to sit around true if you use weed

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.050
properly it tells you how to use it in

00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:27.770
the same thing abuse

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:31.599
maybe some really great writers used it

00:58:31.599 --> 00:58:33.819
sure what happened to a couple sips

00:58:33.819 --> 00:58:36.220
eventually you blow your brains out but

00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.660
you put out some really great [ __ ]

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.450
that's true if that's the goal oh that

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:41.920
is the goal for all humanity it doesn't

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.359
matter how or when you die it's what you

00:58:43.359 --> 00:58:45.609
leave behind man true but I think this

00:58:45.609 --> 00:58:47.619
is a trail of [ __ ] sick ass booze

00:58:47.619 --> 00:58:50.829
dude no dude yes dude I'm telling you

00:58:50.829 --> 00:58:52.299
the sinner you met there's a synergy

00:58:52.299 --> 00:58:54.910
that's being missed out on yeah no I'm

00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:56.799
sure weeds cool if you use it properly I

00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:58.299
think it's literally the best thing

00:58:58.299 --> 00:58:59.740
that's people's plant it's the best

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:01.960
thing in the world dude literally if you

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.609
use it properly it tells ominous

00:59:03.609 --> 00:59:05.529
brainwash it tells your school to play

00:59:05.529 --> 00:59:07.059
they wash they're scared of weed over

00:59:07.059 --> 00:59:08.769
there I talked about doing this deep

00:59:08.769 --> 00:59:10.420
dive somebody's eyes it man

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.059
please legalize it you should but

00:59:13.059 --> 00:59:15.430
Trump's in the way Trump isn't no way

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:16.660
actually he's kind of a dick about it

00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:18.970
actually Trump now Trump is pretty chill

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:20.829
he was saying uh he'd give a

00:59:20.829 --> 00:59:22.150
politician's answer he was like I think

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:23.170
states should be able to do whatever

00:59:23.170 --> 00:59:23.710
they want

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:25.450
yeah still gonna be federally legal so

00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:27.760
it's like all right who the [ __ ]

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.450
argue with that really yeah he's uh I

00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:33.069
don't think really gives a [ __ ] yeah

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:35.829
tell you truth yeah baby telling you bro

00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:37.930
telling you if you do it right I know I

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:40.240
will do in the right mine space it's

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.430
[ __ ] sick I will you get to literally

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:44.769
Tron out in your own brain and then like

00:59:44.769 --> 00:59:46.509
you just come out of it you're like well

00:59:46.509 --> 00:59:47.710
let's go eat something and you're late

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:50.019
it's like the most like innocuous thing

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:51.400
that you come out of and feel great

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.529
afterwards no hang it's like if you do

00:59:53.529 --> 00:59:54.880
it properly it's perfect the problem is

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.829
people get addicted to that experience

00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:58.180
and then they start doing it all the

00:59:58.180 --> 00:59:59.589
time and being like I need to be high to

00:59:59.589 --> 01:00:01.299
go to sleep I need to be high to eat and

01:00:01.299 --> 01:00:03.759
it's like bro you're just abusing the

01:00:03.759 --> 01:00:06.609
[ __ ] medicine teachers spirited it's

01:00:06.609 --> 01:00:08.829
like just just cutoff it for two weeks

01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:10.450
and use it for the experience of guide

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:11.650
yourself and you're doing it dude that

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:13.990
whole thing I had about like you get out

01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:15.220
of a negative state you have to think

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:16.450
positive thoughts to release the

01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:18.099
positive neuro chemicals or whatever in

01:00:18.099 --> 01:00:20.890
order to do that you have to be being

01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:22.089
honest with yourself in order to be
