at the met in philadelphia in that

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.759
bizarre

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.360
yeah that i

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.000
i wish i had done this earlier in life i

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.600
found this out this is a great podcast i

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.240
just want to share this with you

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.520
because if you have to memorize stuff

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.200
you have a hard time memorizing stuff

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.720
this is what happened is

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.040
when i was young and i auditioned um i

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.719
could never memorize lines i had the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.640
hardest time memorizing lines but what

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.640
it was i was memorizing them on a blank

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.600
canvas

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.479
all i was memorizing was the page itself

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.680
i was memorizing the page and i and i i

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.440
realized when i went to serbia and i did

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.800
the machine

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.840
that i would

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.360
when i would think about my lines when

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.800
we were doing rehearsals and try to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.959
memorize them i was actually thinking of

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.840
the actual page and the indentations

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.599
i go you know that paragraph that looks

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.879
like this

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.520
isn't that crazy very visual and i had a

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.879
i was really afraid i wasn't going to

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.800
remember my lines and then the very

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.599
first day we blocked a scene and i went

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.200
oh this is like a map

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.680
and i know that i i did a post all about

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.200
this but i want to go into detail

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200
because it wasn't until i was 48 that i

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.120
realized i could memorize stuff by just

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.280
putting it on a visual map and just

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.120
going it goes to this to this to this to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.560
this and then just drawing the map by

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.480
the way i don't know

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.560
where cedar rapids is and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.080
i know that cedar rapids is here i know

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.400
that green bay's here i know peoria i

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.040
think peoria is just outside of chicago

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.879
but i don't know that and i really don't

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.400
know where sioux city is

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.080
i think it's in

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.239
i think the map would go here to here to

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.560
here to here but i have no [ __ ] idea

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.159
it doesn't matter the map

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.920
is the tool to get you to remember the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.319
things and now i can memorize like crazy

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.680
so i used to have a hard time with

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.440
credit card numbers and now i can

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.599
memorize credit card numbers it's like

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.000
[ __ ] changed my life and it took me

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.159
48 years so i'm sharing this with you if

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.200
you have a child that has a hard time

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.280
memorizing like myself all growing up i

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.680
never could memorize anything

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.200
maybe find this i'm sure this is a

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.879
technique online because i didn't

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.120
discover it on my own i mean i i did

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.879
discover it on my own but i'm certain

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:39.920
that someone else has already thought

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.440
this out

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.200
or or at least

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.200
a visual way to memorize but it's

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.560
[ __ ] amazing

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.400
regardless find me on tour that was my

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.760
point those are my tour dates go to

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.360
burberry.com

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.920
and uh and that's my memory technique

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.480
uh i hope it's

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.760
um i hope you're having a great time i

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.840
hope you're staying safe i hope you're

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.519
feeling good about yourself i hope you

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.560
are

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.159
drinking this morning because this is a

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.120
hard drinking podcast

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.360
i'm certain you will notice a ton of

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.280
indiscrepancies in this podcast because

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.879
we get

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.040
inarguably blackout drunk

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.040
at 10 in the morning yeah

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.799
at 10 in the morning we start off

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.479
i start off with a prank i hope that's

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.240
still in there

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.320
and then we tell some off-color jokes

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.240
that uh that don't make us laugh

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.000
hopefully we're going to edit one or two

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.040
of those i don't know what we're going

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.400

but that was that when we were

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.000
we used your special olympics joke we

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.279
told it again it was my favorite thing

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:52.959
we woke up on the tour bus i think

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:56.160
andrew my cousin was like

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.959
we're talking about uh

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:01.600
words you can't say and and ways to get

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.759
away around it and andrew just goes oh

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:06.000
my god have you seen shane gillis's uh

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.959
special olympics joke and i was like no

00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:11.680
he was like it's [ __ ] awesome and i

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.399
was like shut up what is it he goes i'll

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:16.880
i'll tell it to you and he yeah kind of

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.000
started telling me he goes let's just

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.160
find it and then we found it and you i

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.920
think you just put it out yeah and we

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.880
were like oh my god

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.079
and it's like my favorite thing to do

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:28.000
but it's hard it's really hard to be

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.440
able to write jokes

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.959
so people can tell them back to other

00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:33.600
people definitely it's also hard to like

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.920
work on that like that type of joke like

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.480
that can go that takes a lot of like bad

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.000
sense you feel like you're doing rogue

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.320
yeah yeah yeah

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.600
huh i thought it was funny

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.959
you really thought that

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:48.880
yeah you really thought that what that

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.959
was one of my favorite that's like oh

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:53.120
the way when joe doesn't get a joke is

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.279
is almost better than it's actually

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:57.120
better than when he gets a joke yeah

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.800
like because he's i've sold him so many

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.160
jokes and he goes why would you think

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.279
that

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:02.800
like i'm just telling you well i don't

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.400
think that yeah it's funny to say you

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.559
think that yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:07.600
there was another one

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.880
there's another one in that rogan thing

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.480
that nobody caught or maybe they took it

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.000
out i didn't watch it but there was one

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.600
where i was like we were talking about

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.360
the night stalker yeah did you watch

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.280
that on netflix oh yeah well there was a

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.720
part where the night sucker like broke

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.360
into an old there was two old sisters

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.679
yeah that were like 88 years old and the

00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:25.679
night soccer broke in in like the at

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:27.280
mid-afternoon and killed him with a

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.120
hammer

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.840
i was like is that it's funny and he was

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.320
like he was seriously he was like

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.000
there's nothing funny about that

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.600
i was like i was like well that's that's

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.600
kind of why it's funny that's literally

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.960
zero funny

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.640
it's the best because because joe does

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.000
have a great sense of humor of course

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.840
but he he is on such a different

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.400
wavelength at times where he is i think

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.919
sometimes he's distracted or he's

00:17:49.919 --> 00:17:52.000
thinking about a million things even

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.840
while you're talking to him sometimes

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.000
and uh but those are my favorite those

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.720
are my easily my favorite is

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.320
that that one you said and i just

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.840
figured i'll just go on rogan and he was

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.679
like why would you think that oh that's

00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:05.440
so great that's by the way that's that's

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.840
yo that's so joe yeah i've i remember

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.919
saying one time i was like i was there's

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:12.720
an early appearance and i was like

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.720
i was like i don't know i have a joke

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.320
about the ufc i don't think you like it

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.840
you'd like it he goes why wouldn't i

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.760
like it and i go

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.360
i just didn't i wouldn't think you'd

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.520
like it and he goes tell it to me and so

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.000
i go um

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.760
i think

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.080
i think the ufc should change the rules

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.840
and the match is over when the other guy

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.360
[ __ ] the other guy in the ass and he

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.000
goes why and i go and i'm already like

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.520
this is going horribly

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.919
and he goes and i go well i don't know

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:41.360
how hard would you fight if your [ __ ]

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.799
was on the line i think the fights would

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:43.760
be better and he goes yeah that's a

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.280
great joke and i was like you're not

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.840
laughing yeah yeah yeah like when you

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.400
said why in the middle

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.480
why yeah i go and he goes it's a good

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.760
joke i like that joke why would i like

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.120
that joke can i go

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.039
and then in my head i'm like it's not

00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:59.280
done

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.080
but i'm not telling you

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.000
yeah it's also important to be like well

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.679
why do you think i wouldn't like that

00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:07.360
yeah like well

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.039
and i'm like i don't know

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:10.640
you're a commentator for ufc and you

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.240
might see that

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.000
and then i remember one time i was like

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.679
hold on wait can we go back to what was

00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:17.039
yours that you didn't want to say oh

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:17.919
yeah yeah

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:20.559
sorry so uh you got i got mine yeah yeah

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:22.640
please

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.559
please do a black lives matter black

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:26.000
lives matters i said that the world's

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.919
changing and i think it's i i go i'm

00:19:27.919 --> 00:19:29.679
being honest and this is uh this is

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:31.280
going to go so poorly

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.200
i go i think it's our responsibility

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.280
especially as white people to just

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.120
listen right now as much as we can and

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.880
not say anything and for me for my part

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.480
i've been watching a lot of wild and now

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.130
[Laughter]

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:52.320
oh it didn't end there keep going i go

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.440
uh

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.160
and i go and personally uh if you watch

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.679
enough wild enough you realize it's

00:19:57.679 --> 00:19:59.440
better when the white guy doesn't talk

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.720
and so

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.760
it's so

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.400
oh that's a nice it's like a nice ending

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.240
though it's not like nick cannon comes

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.400
out anti-semitic the weak i write i'm

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.720
doing it and i'm like god and so now all

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.160
of a sudden

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.480
it's just the the the

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.720
tone has changed sure and i'm like [ __ ]

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.640
it you could probably do that now

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.720
no no now now i know one of the guys

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.160
carlos miller really went not really

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.679
well but i text with him all the time

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:24.720
trying to i'm trying to get him to get

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.960
me a car and so and and the i don't know

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.120
if you know the 85 south show have you

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.360
ever seen dude

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.200
there needs to be a cross you want you

want to break down racial barriers in

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:37.600
this country and this is a real thought

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.600
for a second this is a real thought yeah

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.720
we need to

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.600
start

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.480
mixing our podcasts because we got so

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.799
many white guy podcasts and there are so

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:48.880
many straight up black dude podcasts we

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.679
need to start like cross-pollinating so

00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:54.720
that our audiences who all get comedy

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.000
realize oh they're like i guarantee you

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.320

actors they have i mean carlos is like

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.840
[ __ ] i think he's like

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.679
a entrepreneur but

00:21:15.679 --> 00:21:17.200
they're all comics right they're just

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.720
comics and if they saw your comedy

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.400
they'd be like you're funny as [ __ ] so

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.559
then you go and do their show and then

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:24.720
their show is that when they they do

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.200
call it they do like arenas right now

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.400
and but it's all oh dude yeah they are

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.640
so [ __ ] big 85 so i've talked about

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.039
them so much but their show is so good

00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:37.360
you just go smoking it's in atlanta

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.840

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.400
talk [ __ ] just talk [ __ ] and it's very

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.870
casual like the first first um

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.799
[Music]

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:48.320
there's so many really great podcasts

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.480
out there especially

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.159
black dude podcast t-pain's got a

00:21:52.159 --> 00:21:53.200
podcast

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.000
black dude podcast is like it's like but

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.880
it's it's a genre i mean it really is

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.799
and uh and i think that's the way what

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:02.159
we should do is start

00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:04.400

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.360
family though i don't think i'm gonna

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.000

i was like i don't really need it and

00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:27.280
then once i hit how bad was your cobit

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.360
not bad i got lucky yeah but it was uh

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.880
yeah and then as soon as i had to do it

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.120
i was just being lazy it wasn't like

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.480
like i was doing the road i didn't feel

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.840

the thing that i started doing and i

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.320

me like i'm i'm performing at this place

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.360
because this is what i do for a living

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.159
at the improv and so you need to

00:32:46.159 --> 00:32:48.240
you talk to the [ __ ] club talk to the

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.760
[ __ ] state officials i don't know

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.720
what the [ __ ] i tell you i got like

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.840
yeah i've heard a couple comics like

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.360
feel bad about that

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.919
like the club's requiring vaccines and i

00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:02.240
don't think that i i i

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.000
i'm talking specifically about improv

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.919
and story sure i don't think a comic has

00:33:05.919 --> 00:33:07.519
a right to say a [ __ ] word don't

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:08.640
perform there

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.919
like you know it's like it's like hey

00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:11.519
listen they're running a business

00:33:11.519 --> 00:33:12.960
they've got employees that they've got

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.080
they're liable for they they can't they

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.440
let them run a business and i think if

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.600
i'm not mistaken i don't know it's it's

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.919
state issues so like i i stay out of it

00:33:21.919 --> 00:33:22.880
because i'm like

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.480
because first of all i don't know enough

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.320
about any of this [ __ ]

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.080
and and it just it's funny it's funny

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.000
when you do try to say something yeah

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.159
like everyone's gonna all say like uh

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:34.399
yeah i got it or whatever and then

00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:36.640
everybody will be like [ __ ]

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.640
you [ __ ] [ __ ] and then i'm like yeah

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.919
i'm not getting it and people like

00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:41.600
retards

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.440
yeah yeah i don't know what yeah well

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.960
that's the whole thing i guess that's

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.120
called having convictions and i don't i

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.880
don't have convictions either

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.159
why don't you think you have convictions

00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:51.200
is it because your dad because mine's

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.000
because of my dad really oh yeah my dad

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.200
would not

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.960
let me have an opinion whatever my

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.799
opinion was he would take the opposite

00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:01.120
and prove me why i was wrong really oh

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.240
yeah

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.399
oh yeah psycho that's pretty funny

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:06.000
though but i think it formed me into a

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.440
guy who

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.320

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.000
to give our spots up we're going to

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.599

driven it's it's not

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.960
maybe it's different uh where she lives

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.839
but

00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:15.119
and i did but i didn't say anything

00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:17.599
really like i didn't like hold her

00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:19.280
what it's not different where she lives

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.440

way we see food with a psychological

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.359
based approach that looks at what you

00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:20.160
eat

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.920
but also how you eat instead of making

yet or he has and he's not released it

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:19.440

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.160
he did

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.119
he did

00:53:27.119 --> 00:53:29.520
a telemarketer joke do you know the joke

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.480
i'm talking about i think so

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.800
telemarketer joke with the indian guy

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.640
accent

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.920
and

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.599
what is and this is what i loved about

00:53:37.599 --> 00:53:41.119
louis what is a by far a hacky premise

00:53:41.119 --> 00:53:42.800
and turn it into one of the greatest

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.839
bits i've ever seen and i was like

00:53:45.839 --> 00:53:47.280
oh [ __ ]

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.680
and that's that's the fun that's the

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.359
what i love this is your first special

00:53:51.359 --> 00:53:53.520
yeah what i love about specials is when

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.040
you challenge yourself

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.520
to do something really difficult

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.760
in your next special and go like i want

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.599
to i like i want to come up with a very

00:54:01.599 --> 00:54:04.240
hacky premise and make it brilliant so

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.280
that you go

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.040
not any not just

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.280
no all not all hacky premises are bad

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:12.319
yeah like go airplane food and then make

00:54:12.319 --> 00:54:14.559
it the best joke sure anyone's ever

00:54:14.559 --> 00:54:16.720
heard and when louie used to do that and

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.800
stan hope does it yeah

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.319
it was funny when i was when i was young

00:54:20.319 --> 00:54:22.480
or like not in comedy i was like why are

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.520

remember things that are good like

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.960
things that are

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.040
dude when we drank at that show

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.440
that [ __ ] calling to sick calling to

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.760
work sick yeah

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.760
dude pouring those big ass cups of

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.079
fireball i was just like oh my god

00:55:40.079 --> 00:55:41.920

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.400
drink before a show it's a bad show oh

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.000

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.920

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:16.000
full weekend after that

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.599
no that's not the weekend

00:56:19.599 --> 00:56:21.680
there was a weekend where i was like in

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:24.240
philly where i was like i think i might

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.680
have an ulcer

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.920
and i was looking for juices

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.160
was that where we were drinking um we

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.559
were drinking those uh

00:56:32.559 --> 00:56:34.319
those

00:56:34.319 --> 00:56:36.880
uh beet cavases i don't know i don't

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.240
think um but uh yeah that was uh

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.160
that i don't drink fireball anymore i

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.920
won't yeah it's time had one night of

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.920
fireball on the impractical joker's

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:46.880
cruise

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.720
that ruined the taste of fireball for

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.559
the rest of my life dude you were you

00:56:50.559 --> 00:56:52.559
the fireball is like

00:56:52.559 --> 00:56:54.799
you take one shot of it maybe and yeah

00:56:54.799 --> 00:56:56.640
like all right that's that's indigestion

00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.040
for the rest of the night oh i'm done

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.359
dude you're drinking solo cups of it i

00:57:01.359 --> 00:57:02.960
was there was well there was a point

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.920
where i said i ate so bad i had a rule

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.240
that i said fireball doesn't technically

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.920
count as a shot yeah so if you want to

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.040
do shock to me i don't do shots but i

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.799
preaching the choir yeah and uh what's

01:02:30.799 --> 01:02:32.960
crazy is in comedy a lot of people most

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.400
comics quit

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.799
drinking yeah because you kind of you sh

01:02:36.799 --> 01:02:38.960
you have to a lot of people

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.559
but

01:02:40.559 --> 01:02:42.319
yeah so i there's like four guys i can

01:02:42.319 --> 01:02:43.599
drink with

01:02:43.599 --> 01:02:44.799
in new york

01:02:44.799 --> 01:02:49.200
ari ariel jr norman

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.520
comes and goes but he's

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.520
training for like a

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.920
mma fight yeah i saw the fight diaries

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.960
yeah

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.799
i can't tell if they're scripted or not

01:03:02.799 --> 01:03:04.400
they are they have to be they have to be

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.200
yeah

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.240
he's in there taking a [ __ ] yeah

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.960
yeah um

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.839
but

01:03:11.839 --> 01:03:14.000
it's you know what's interesting

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.920
uh i shouldn't say that say it

01:03:19.359 --> 01:03:20.799
okay i think i can say this i think i

01:03:20.799 --> 01:03:23.119
can say this pretty um accurately

01:03:23.119 --> 01:03:25.760
so like i think it's fair to say

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.839
that lewis won't be hosting america's

01:03:27.839 --> 01:03:30.160
got talent anytime soon yes like he's

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.839
not going to be getting a network sitcom

01:03:31.839 --> 01:03:33.520
i don't think he wants that right yeah i

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.400
don't think he wants that i think he's

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.319
happy doing what he does and there's a

01:03:36.319 --> 01:03:39.039
certain like you know the skanks legion

01:03:39.039 --> 01:03:41.200
of skanks crew

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.799
but not really like

01:03:42.799 --> 01:03:44.480
dave and jay are a little different but

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.799
there is like a get in there like ari

01:03:46.799 --> 01:03:48.559
will not be doing a network sitcom

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:50.559
anytime soon yeah and it's it's

01:03:50.559 --> 01:03:52.240
interesting

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.240
is that i probably won't be doing that i

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.079
mean i remember when they offered one to

01:03:56.079 --> 01:03:57.359
joey and i was like

01:03:57.359 --> 01:03:59.280
miss miss patches did one she was a drug

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.119
dealer yeah convicted felon so maybe

01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:02.799
they're broadening their scope but

01:04:02.799 --> 01:04:04.079
what's interesting is you had the

01:04:04.079 --> 01:04:07.280
opportunity when that snl thing happened

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.960
to just go

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.000
to go i'm going harder down and finding

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.559
my fan base and [ __ ] them

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.480
right and [ __ ] the industry [ __ ]

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:19.119
everyone but in a weird way you just

01:04:19.119 --> 01:04:20.640
this is no slight to those guys i just

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.680
mentioned but i'm saying you decided

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.359
to not

01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:27.440
double down and be like

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.480
yeah

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.440
i'm a i'm i'm conservative these are my

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.920
politics you said i'm actually a really

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.000
talented comic i i'm

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.200
i'm not for everyone but but i am also a

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.720
very good actor and i'm also a great

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.079
sketch writer and there was a reason i

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:44.240
got cast on snl and i'm going to

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.559
continue making great sketches that

01:04:46.559 --> 01:04:47.839
they're going to be dirty they're going

01:04:47.839 --> 01:04:49.039
to be funny but you're going to laugh

01:04:49.039 --> 01:04:51.039
that's all that matters and you go and

01:04:51.039 --> 01:04:53.599
and i'm going to do a special i clearly

01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:55.520
put one out on youtube people going to

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.119
see how talented i am and i am cool to

01:04:57.119 --> 01:04:59.119
go back into the industry yeah if it'll

01:04:59.119 --> 01:05:00.160
happen

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.720
yeah i mean i it depends what it is

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.440
obviously with the industry but

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.760
uh yeah and it's it's a weird time where

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.680
it's like what do you you know what even

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:12.240
is the future of the industry so like

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.440
i'm not like

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.280
i'm certainly not like pandering or like

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.280
trying to get back in or whatever i'm

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.559
just doing what

01:05:18.559 --> 01:05:20.640
exactly i was doing yeah you know what i

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.640
mean i'm not going to like lean in

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.240
to being like

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.520
and then not talking not legion

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.359
mechanics but like like edgy i'm not

01:05:27.359 --> 01:05:29.119
like uh

01:05:29.119 --> 01:05:30.640
you know i'm not gonna

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.920
and i'm not gonna lie about being like

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.319
i'm a republican i'm not yeah you know

01:05:34.319 --> 01:05:36.079
what i mean yeah it's and there's that

01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:37.520
there's that there is that opportunity

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.640
to do that especially when you get

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.799
canceled to be like

01:05:40.799 --> 01:05:41.599
like

01:05:41.599 --> 01:05:42.880
literally been like

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.799
i love president trump

01:05:44.799 --> 01:05:46.799
when i got canceled and probably went to

01:05:46.799 --> 01:05:48.079
the white house

01:05:48.079 --> 01:05:49.599
you know i mean he would have been like

01:05:49.599 --> 01:05:52.559
yeah [ __ ] snl like oh definitely

01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:54.480
definitely he was petty he would have

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.000
been like yeah this guy's the best he

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.599
could have gone to the white house

01:05:57.599 --> 01:05:59.760
and gone viral yeah

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.280
what do you like more do you like

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.680

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.400
it hits your stand up or gillian keeves

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.920

that was like the first

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.319
it was like the first content i ever put

01:06:16.319 --> 01:06:18.480
out really outside of like podcasts and

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.680
things like that but that was like the

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.240
first thing that was like mine yeah so

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.680
that was fun every time we put something

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.440
out and just getting feedback from

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.200
people that you like respect

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.039
that's really cool what's the what what

01:06:29.039 --> 01:06:31.760
is your budget on when you make those um

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:35.280
a lot like i put i put 50 000 into it

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.599

booklight matched it

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.480
really yeah yeah

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.079
that's worth it yeah it was fun it's

01:06:48.079 --> 01:06:49.599
very worth it yeah

01:06:49.599 --> 01:06:51.599
that's very worth it

01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:53.119

yeah it's just like here i'll put out

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:02.880

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.880
to

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.960
interesting

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.119
it's interesting because

01:07:09.119 --> 01:07:10.799
that was that's the key with podcasts is

01:07:10.799 --> 01:07:12.640
you put it out for free yeah i want you

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.920
to get this for free i want to get a

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.760
bunch of free content so that you know

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.280
that when i come to your city the only

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.880
thing i ask is you come see me perform

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.400
yeah i'm really good at it it's the

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.599
thing i do

01:07:21.599 --> 01:07:23.359
but the podcast is

01:07:23.359 --> 01:07:24.720
for you just every day if you're just

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.920
bored and by the way they're not all

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.079
great but yeah sometimes they do so i

01:07:28.079 --> 01:07:30.000
got a bunch of stinkers yeah yeah yeah

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.880
and i i'm curious of what how this one

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.280

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.200
i still talk way too much but this one's

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:39.760
been really good

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.839
uh but ari and i were talking about the

01:07:41.839 --> 01:07:44.160
interview format of hanging out

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.520
i think it's better when these chairs

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.760
are filled like if you have three people

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.119

01:09:10.239 --> 01:09:10.880
many

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.960
when it was so funny when you were the

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.799
first person where something was a seven

01:09:14.799 --> 01:09:16.080
on a podcast where i was like wouldn't

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.239
you drop over something

01:09:18.239 --> 01:09:19.839
and then they're like oh yeah and then

01:09:19.839 --> 01:09:22.080
they started deep diving people and then

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.000
i was like oh well that would that was

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:24.719
like

01:09:24.719 --> 01:09:26.159
the funniest part to me would be when

01:09:26.159 --> 01:09:28.400
like other comics would like [ __ ] on me

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.319
yeah when i was getting in trouble that

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:32.839
had all been on podcasts that had all

01:09:32.839 --> 01:09:34.480

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:41.839
lot sure you want to do this now i never

01:09:41.839 --> 01:09:43.279

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.880
chance but i think at this point

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.040
the way things are done independently

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.400
yeah i think you're on that track and i

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.840
think you've already succeeded on that

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.600
track i mean gillian keeves is one of

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.400
the best sketches and it honestly and i

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.360
don't know if you guys did this on

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.199
purpose it's branded like it's a comedy

01:11:19.199 --> 01:11:20.960
central show yeah it looks like it's

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.960
comedy central john that's john john's

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.239
like he's a [ __ ] pro yeah he's like

01:11:26.239 --> 01:11:27.840
usually i mean listening to him talk he

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:30.800
directs he he writes and directs and he

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.239
can easily star

01:11:32.239 --> 01:11:34.560
in all of them he's so good you both you

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.120
guys are really good he did stand up

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.040
he got like he was out of philly he did

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.520
comedy he he got like jfl right away he

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.520
did adam divine's house party he was

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.120
like really dude he's an incredible

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.640
stand-up and then he was just like i

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.960
don't like it and stopped

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.320
because he likes he likes writing and

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.640
acting and directing and

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.320
but his standard like every once while

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.960
he'd like drop in and feature a weekend

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.199
at helium just to like do it having not

done stand-up for like two years it's

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.360
funny to me murder it's funny to me

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.440
because it's so hard it's so easy to

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.440
tell a joke it's so hard to write

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.320
something that's funny

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.159
the the the

01:12:12.159 --> 01:12:15.120
uh al qaeda car sales yeah yeah yeah

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.400
that one was me

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.320
that's one of my favorites but john yeah

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.679
but see that's the thing like i'll come

01:12:19.679 --> 01:12:23.199
up with like a slight idea like that one

01:12:23.199 --> 01:12:25.280
and john will just make it

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.120
a sketch because i can't write like john

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.120
can [ __ ] write the only thing i've

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.199
ever done funny and by the way i'm sure

01:12:31.199 --> 01:12:32.960
i get in trouble for it now

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.800
but i wrote it i wrote a sketch i don't

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.719
think it's you can find it anymore

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:38.640
travel channel that's the one thing that

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.440
the one saving grace i have and i'm

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.800
certain you could go through my history

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.800
anyone's history and find horrible stuff

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.000
they co-signed on that you get in

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
trouble for laughing at someone saying

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.679
something horrible like that's what's

01:12:49.679 --> 01:12:52.320
kind of [ __ ] up it's like i can't help

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:55.280
but can you though i don't get in slight

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.440
trouble but

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.760
has anybody gotten like

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.320
canceled from a podcast other than me

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.199
uh

01:13:03.199 --> 01:13:04.719
no there's been attempts there's been

01:13:04.719 --> 01:13:07.360
attempts but i'm the i think oh the

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.040
jeopardy guy

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.120
yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah what's good

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.120
about him oh what is that what he said

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.840
he said like booth or something and yeah

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.920
yeah jeopardy's very i mean i guess you

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.920
got to think your brand right i guess i

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.280
mean

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.719
i've been lucky enough that the things

01:13:24.719 --> 01:13:27.600
i've done like the things i've done

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.960
have all been

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.120
still the same brand i have been

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.560
meaning like so like

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.560
like when i did the cabin

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.640
that we did we had a lot of stuff that

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:41.520
was very cancelable on it sure extremely

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.679
and netflix was like we got it it's

01:13:43.679 --> 01:13:44.960
funny we think it's funny we know your

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.480
comics we know you're going for the joke

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:47.679
they had our back

01:13:47.679 --> 01:13:50.800
it was i mean top to bottom

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.719
uh the very first thing the very first

01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:55.199
thing we did on that show tom was like

01:13:55.199 --> 01:13:58.080

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.640
hardest

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:23.920
and then and then

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.320
and then it's it's it we aired it

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.199

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.840
some stuff that was a little like there

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.360
were some jokes where we couldn't we

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:38.880
just went maybe went a little too far of

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.640
course and they edited it out yeah but

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.640
you but your attempt is in humor right

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.199
yes and then uh and then i

01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:47.040
i didn't even realize what was happening

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.400
yeah cabinets uh

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.719
i have a general i i'm

01:14:52.719 --> 01:14:54.480
in production on a movie

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.520
and we're at the point where we're going

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.040
to decide whether or not we make it

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.640
cabin airs

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.719
and i have a me i have a [ __ ] zoom

01:15:00.719 --> 01:15:03.840
call with a person who's a very

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.600
big animal activist and one of the

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.120
things we did was we

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.760
uh processed is the way to say it where

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.560
it doesn't sound bad we processed an emu

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:15.280
nice yeah that people eat emu yeah

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.520
that's how you do it yes and so uh and

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.880
she said you know i gotta be honest with

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.320
you i'm a very big animal rights

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.480
activist the second i saw it i saw where

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.760
you guys were going

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.440
i thought i was going to be offended

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:28.080
very badly but i couldn't stop laughing

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.320
at you and tom she was like it was it

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.040
was

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.960
you did it well and i went into my head

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.400
i was like

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.400
and then i realized oh my god this movie

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.480
would have just gone away

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.560
yeah if she just felt like if it would

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.080
have just gone away and yeah and then

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.520
and then we ended up making the movie

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.280
when we made the movie

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.520
and first day

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.600
i

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.920
i do some things to to make the movie

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.600
what i think is funnier sure you know

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.199
i'm not i don't want to i don't want to

01:15:55.199 --> 01:15:57.440
be i want to be broad so that it doesn't

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.679
sound but i you know i punch up some

01:15:59.679 --> 01:16:01.520
things so i think that this scene that

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.040
we're shooting can be funnier but i

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.040
punch up in a way where you will laugh

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.600
and i will laugh but a lot of people are

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.199
going to go whoa

01:16:09.199 --> 01:16:10.080
yeah

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.640
but i know but it's funny it's funny and

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.679
by the way it doesn't work it doesn't

01:16:13.679 --> 01:16:15.440
work and we reshoot it or whatever you

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.800
know

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.960
and uh and i don't even realize what the

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.320
[ __ ] i'm doing because we shoot it and

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.159
then obviously all that footage goes to

01:16:22.159 --> 01:16:23.760
an editor who does a

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.120
quick cut and then sends it to all the

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.520
executives yeah this is our first day

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.520
shooting this is when they pull plugs on

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:30.880
movies

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.280
and the [ __ ] text i get

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.000
when i text i get i will just say the

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.040
text i get was was positive nice and i

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.679
went cool that's the lane i'm in yeah

01:16:41.679 --> 01:16:43.360
that's that's where i go and i've just

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.199
been lucky enough to that maybe i'm not

01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:47.600
maybe maybe my sensibility isn't too far

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.679
but i think it is i know it is maybe

01:16:49.679 --> 01:16:51.280
there's a likability that get i can get

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.360
away with when you're making a project

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.960
and people know that your intent is to

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.640
make them laugh like when you do stand

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:59.760
up or a podcast or you know i think

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.040
might cancel thing the thing that's

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.280
going to catch me is my camera will be

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.199
on and people will watch me jerk off and

01:17:05.199 --> 01:17:06.320
i'm always afraid of that and then

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.840
they'll never be able to see me the same

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:08.560
yeah

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.400
because i jerk off as soon as every

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.320
podcast ends i

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:13.440
jerk off

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.960
i don't even get up i've jerked off

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:17.040
during opie and anthony listening to it

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.880
watching porn with the volume down on

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.560
the porn and it was when patrice died

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.000
and i'm jerking off

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.560
and you can hear the audio of them

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.080
crying about patrice and i'm watching

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.760
and i just was watching it and then porn

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.600
came up i was like oh my jerk off and

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.199
that and as it got done i went if

01:17:31.199 --> 01:17:32.800
someone had a call to my camera then i

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.560
would be [ __ ]

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.719
like those things are where i think

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:38.880
it's it's it where i some sometimes i

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.640
think it's it's when your brand doesn't

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.560
match up to who you are

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:45.760
you know yeah like

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.760
i agree i agree if you're like if you

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:50.320
present yourself as a very like clean

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.840
clean guy yeah and then all of a sudden

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.199
there's a clip of you

01:17:53.199 --> 01:17:56.000
saying some wild [ __ ] yeah yes i'm a

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
pretty wild dude everyone knows i'm wild

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.600
and i think as long as you stay in that

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.880
thing and just try not to hurt anyone's

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.880
feelings yeah ultimately i think you're

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.400
i don't know who [ __ ] knows you never

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.560
know but you never know it's been a fun

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.360
run

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.719
and and by the way when i look at

01:18:08.719 --> 01:18:10.400
someone like you and i go oh you just

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.679
got to keep putting out good [ __ ] for

01:18:11.679 --> 01:18:13.440
sure i think more people

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.440
i think i think

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.960
you're someone i've talked about so

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.800
[ __ ] much yeah because you are so

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.719
funny thanks but it's a weird kind of

01:18:20.719 --> 01:18:23.040
funny because you're like bill burr you

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:26.960
have a very acute way of

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.520
of defining a situation like how do you

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.280
how do you write a joke

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.719
uh

01:18:32.719 --> 01:18:34.800
i don't know the podcast helps it's just

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.400
sitting down with matt and like

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.840
bullshitting and then being like oh this

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.360
is actually a premise

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.120
this is a and then going and doing it

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.360
and saying it on stage like i and it's

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.520
funny too because like burr was a guy i

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.719
was a huge fan of and that was one of

01:18:46.719 --> 01:18:48.320
the first like podcasts i listened to

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.560
constantly and then

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.560
you would see his special at the end of

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.400
that year or whatever and it was like oh

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.000
i've heard all these because it was you

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.760
listen to him rant yeah and it's like oh

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.760
he that's i think podcasts help

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.840
tremendously with coming up jokes coming

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.280
up with jokes because i don't i don't

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.880
sit down and write

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.640
oh yeah i don't

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.840
actually after watching

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.760
i mean after watching your special i was

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.520
like i'm gonna actually try to write

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.520
some stuff i can't

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.920

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.159
so you know everyone's thinking thinks

01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:57.920

didn't put up a norm post yet and i went

01:23:00.719 --> 01:23:02.159

like i need to come out and be like

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:25.040
it it made me feel so gross

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:29.679
to find a picture of him yeah

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.840

and then

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.120
and then

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.719
i wrote like nine different things and

01:23:38.719 --> 01:23:40.480
this is when i cried so i'm in the i'm

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.840
in

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.520
i'm in the house i'm drinking a bottle

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.040
of wine

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.280
and i'm and i'm voice texting when i

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.920
said i started crying and i went oh [ __ ]

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.840
because he was just like

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.679
he was so cool to me like you know yeah

01:23:53.679 --> 01:23:55.040
the thing he did that was the coolest

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.600
thing that anyone could ever do is he

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.960
knew my name

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.960
yeah before he needed to like he just

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.840
went bert cries her yeah hey

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.520
taking the shirt off tonight are we yeah

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.159
and i go oh he knows who i am

01:24:08.159 --> 01:24:09.600
and then he [ __ ]

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.000
and then and then

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.840
what's really interesting is when he

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.280
knew he was dying

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.560
apparently

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.670
he had texted me and said um

01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:20.320
[Music]

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.239
whatever but he and at that point that

01:24:22.239 --> 01:24:24.400
that's when he knew he was dying

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:28.000
he texted me and and i i thought

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.280
this is what i one of my posts i thought

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.920
about doing taking our texts right and

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.520
then marking them out so you can't see

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.440
it and then posting that and going this

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:36.560
is the most meaningful thing that's ever

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.760
happened i know but i didn't i didn't

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.120
yeah i didn't want to do that that's a

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.600
personal yeah it's personal and then you

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.280
and then and then the

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:44.960
the internet mob just comes after you

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.400
and goes why aren't why haven't you

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.840
started grieving yet

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.520
and you're like i am i don't yeah i

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.199
don't need to post it online and then

01:24:51.199 --> 01:24:53.600
part of you as a coward goes okay i'm

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:56.560
hey everyone i noticed that he's passed

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.159
yeah

01:24:58.159 --> 01:25:00.800
it's the grossest part of the internet i

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.880
really think the taliban could

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.639
take over america if they started with

01:25:04.639 --> 01:25:07.920
the internet um

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.320
taliban's got some i will say this got

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.800
some okay i was looking at the met yeah

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.400
i was looking at the met gal or whatever

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.320
that was the met taliban wouldn't let

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.159
that happen the dresses all that [ __ ]

01:25:18.159 --> 01:25:19.360
and then i was looking at there was a

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:21.120
video of the taliban hitting a lady with

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.560
a stick

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:26.220
and i was like i think

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:27.020
[Music]

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:31.870
[Laughter]

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.840
we need a middle ground so i think we've

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:43.040
reached the point where

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.520
the taliban's not right [ __ ] but i think

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.040
we're wrong too do you realize what the

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.560
taliban would do if they first of all

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.000
they would love kim kardashian's outfits

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.159
their face was covered true they do you

01:25:52.159 --> 01:25:54.560
realize how

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:58.159
how the taliban would lose they must

01:25:58.159 --> 01:25:59.920
someone should tag i think they might

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.040
laugh

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.480
i think if they saw it i don't know i

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.719

that wore like a women's suffrage dress

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.320
just had like women's rights all over it

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.120
oh wait hold on sorry aoc okay i thought

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.679
i actually liked aoc is dressed because

01:26:59.679 --> 01:27:01.120
didn't she go to a place where all the

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.600
rich people hang out and then go tax the

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.400
rich yeah i love it she paid thirty

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.600
thousand dollars to go to it what yeah

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.639
hold on

01:27:10.639 --> 01:27:11.760
and that dress

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.280
the dress probably i didn't know you had

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.880
to pay to go to this thing yeah i

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.480
believe so i thought this was just i

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.239
think the met gala is like a thirty

01:27:18.239 --> 01:27:21.280
thousand dollar ticket i could no

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:23.520
no [ __ ] google this i thought it was

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:25.199
just like i thought it was like yeah

01:27:25.199 --> 01:27:27.280
they could have built a school

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.600
but instead they wore nice dresses hold

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.400
on

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.360
no this has got to be impossible so wait

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:34.719
see this is why i'm that's why i have no

01:27:34.719 --> 01:27:38.000
conviction oh my god i was way off

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.639
holy [ __ ]

01:27:40.639 --> 01:27:43.199
so pete davidson i paid thirty thousand

01:27:43.199 --> 01:27:45.280
dollars i bet somebody sponsors them i

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.040
bet someone had to sponsor her somebody

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:49.760
who makes the dress or something

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:52.880

off-brand right when we talk about

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.800
sh is it

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:50.639

01:29:50.639 --> 01:29:52.639
yeah okay i don't even really know who

01:29:52.639 --> 01:29:54.480
aoc is i know that she's like a

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.400
politician i think i think on a lot of

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.199
stuff

01:29:57.199 --> 01:29:59.360
she's fine

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.880
uh

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:03.760
is she like she must be she's pretty

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:06.159
i really don't know but she uh

01:30:06.159 --> 01:30:07.960
alexandria

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.400
ocasio-cortez yes oh she's from the

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:13.280
bronx right i know who she is um she's

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.600
friends with uh diesel zamiro

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.360
oh nice i think she's from the bronx you

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.560
from the bronx

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:21.040
i think she's served as a u.s

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.880
representative for new york's 14th

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:25.520
congressional district since 2019. yeah

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.280
she was born in the bronx but see this

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.800
is where they lean into that i think she

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.960
was born outside in new york really and

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:33.360
i think her name was like peggy

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:36.880
no i believed dude you know the

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.760
[ __ ] de blasio's name is like

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.920
wilhelm

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.159

i should have done they're all psychos i

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.320

i think that's her real name but it's

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:50.719
going to be no one change i think she

01:30:50.719 --> 01:30:52.480
went by like no one changes their name

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.280

01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:59.760
activist she went down to the border and

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:03.199

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.520
i have so many

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.199
i have so many friends that i grew up

01:33:55.199 --> 01:33:58.560
with that are all conservative that some

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.639
of them some of them i

01:34:00.639 --> 01:34:02.480
i can be around and i can hang out with

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:04.159
but like they've gotten sober they're

01:34:04.159 --> 01:34:05.840
christian okay like that type of

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.159
conservative sucks yeah and i'm like i

01:34:08.159 --> 01:34:09.760
don't know that type of conservative

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.280
sucks here's the problem you ready

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.440
here's the distinct problem with my

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:16.560
politics is my my legit politics are

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:19.120
comedy first right yeah so like so for

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.600
instance uh i had

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:25.679
i was gobbling up trump 2020 memorabilia

01:34:25.679 --> 01:34:27.840
yeah i was buying it any time i saw it

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:29.600
anytime i saw it i'd buy it

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.400
and

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.120
and

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.199
the problem with that is is you move

01:34:33.199 --> 01:34:35.199
into a new house and you have people

01:34:35.199 --> 01:34:38.000
move you and they are putting away

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.920
uh 12-inch dildos guns trump like i look

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:44.480
like a [ __ ] lunatic on paper but i

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:46.639
get like and then you don't even the

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:48.000
other problem is it's so all over your

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.679
life that you don't even realize it so

01:34:49.679 --> 01:34:51.040
like i have a trump sticker on my

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:54.560
microwave in here and miss pat came in

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.480
and with with all with like three yeah

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.040
other black women and then oh and you

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:01.679
they see something they just go uh

01:35:01.679 --> 01:35:03.280
and you don't even realize it's there

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.199
and you're like oh it's a joke like i i

01:35:05.199 --> 01:35:07.840
bought it i was in arizona like yeah i

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.679
put up a trump flag my daughters were

01:35:09.679 --> 01:35:11.840
gone

01:35:12.639 --> 01:35:14.000
you really leaned into this bit you're

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.400
like i voted for him i donated i mean

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:18.159
the whole bit was crazy

01:35:18.159 --> 01:35:20.400

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.159
jordan rubin joe's jordan ruben has a

01:35:22.159 --> 01:35:23.360
joke he goes

i'm gonna [ __ ] this up but he's like a

01:36:38.719 --> 01:36:41.360
very large gold chain would be a very

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.120
nice gift for a

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:46.560
expensive slave

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:49.600
you can't say that

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.760
who's writing this you can't say that

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:53.360
yeah he's like i didn't write it yeah

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:54.639
that was the best that was the bit every

01:36:54.639 --> 01:36:56.159
time i didn't write it every time they

01:36:56.159 --> 01:36:58.080
would go who wrote this yeah some guy

01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.040
well you know what's so funny about

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.119
norma's he really did deconstruct things

01:37:01.119 --> 01:37:02.560
like

01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:04.800
like when we did the cabin i had writers

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.960
write jokes for me yeah and i really

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:09.040
said some horrible stuff especially to

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.440
caitlyn jenner yeah and and

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.600
it there really is i i think but now

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.600
when i go especially

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.760
i said some pretty aggressive stuff and

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.520
what did you say i don't want to go over

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:20.400
it but

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.639
she was cool [ __ ] about it yeah but if

01:37:22.639 --> 01:37:24.719
if someone got those and she didn't

01:37:24.719 --> 01:37:26.320
laugh no one laughed nikki glazer was

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.639
like oh yeah and i was like what i don't

01:37:28.639 --> 01:37:29.920
i have someone wrote it

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:31.840
yeah i'm working right now people yeah

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.760
like i'm doing my [ __ ] job yeah and

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.760
that's the thing about norm is that he

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.159
he kind of deconstructed the

01:37:38.159 --> 01:37:41.360
the joke like i didn't write it yeah

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:42.880
there's literally a whole compilation of

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.239
who wrote this

01:37:44.239 --> 01:37:45.679
yeah because every single guest would

01:37:45.679 --> 01:37:46.960
say the same thing they'd read a joke

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.960
and be like who you wrote doesn't seem

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.960
like yeah right yeah

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.400
some guy

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.880
yeah it's

01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.719
yeah i think what's what i love that

01:37:56.719 --> 01:37:58.400
sucks he was

01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:00.400
he was like

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.480
one of my favorites easily like he was

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:03.920
the best do you remember when you

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:05.360

he doesn't miss a beat at 95 or however

01:41:32.719 --> 01:41:34.400
old he was at the time so normal goes

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:35.600

hills country club or something it's

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:51.840

01:41:53.199 --> 01:41:56.159
club and he goes he said he he shows up

01:41:56.159 --> 01:41:59.119
to the table and it is comedy legends i

01:41:59.119 --> 01:42:00.480
mean like the

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:02.800
[ __ ] who's who of comedy and as a

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.880
comedy fan he's just like oh my god i'm

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.880

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.800
these guys

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.480
george burns shows up

01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:13.280
totally lucid and he goes ah

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.960
guys

01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:17.440
this right here is the future of comedy

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:20.400
and he's like he's everyone's like whoa

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.480
yeah and so george burns sits down and

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.719
norm stands up and he starts pitching

01:42:24.719 --> 01:42:27.760
his movie and it's killing it's like i'm

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.760
about to make a movie with george burns

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.679
george burns is laughing everyone else

01:42:31.679 --> 01:42:33.520
is laughing because george is laughing

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:35.760
and halfway

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.480
through his [ __ ] he looks over and

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:43.040
george burns is buttering his hand

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.719
he goes this is no one's making this

01:42:44.719 --> 01:42:47.040
movie

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:52.880
george burns is buttering his hand

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:53.920
ah

01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:55.360
just my luck

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.080
oh and by the way i'm i'm certain

01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.360
there's probably a better version of

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.119
that story more accurate

01:43:01.119 --> 01:43:02.560
i birded it up a little bit it's

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.320
hilarious but i heard it on radio i'm

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.239
crying laughing because you know he

01:43:06.239 --> 01:43:08.800
tells him with the norm cadence yeah

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.960
oh what a great [ __ ] dude

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:13.280
he was how he talked about it oh who

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:16.080
should i see there but george burns yeah

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.840
yeah yeah yeah

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:20.400
oh it's funny too because

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.320
there are

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:25.440
i think that style of of comedy because

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:27.840
you couldn't tell if he was

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:30.560
the the joke if he was joking with you

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.000
you couldn't tell if he was [ __ ] with

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.280
you

01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:36.239
you know like there was a

01:43:36.239 --> 01:43:37.440
yeah he always had that like he would

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.880
say he's like

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.400
he never drank

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:41.840
yeah i say stuff like that constantly

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.119
and it's like did he

01:43:43.119 --> 01:43:45.040
yeah i think he did i'm almost certain

01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:47.280
but i have no idea he came in and he

01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:48.480
walked into the

01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:51.199
backstory of the store one time

01:43:51.199 --> 01:43:53.280
and uh and someone said no okay some

01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:55.920
drinkers no no sober sober

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:57.440
it looks like joe what you got in that

01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.280
pen and he goes oh it's marijuana he

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.800
goes i'll take a hit

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.159
and he took it and joe goes it's really

01:44:02.159 --> 01:44:05.960
strong and norm just

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:10.400
bill clinton killed a man and we're like

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.719
what the [ __ ]

01:44:12.719 --> 01:44:15.360
he just was so [ __ ]

01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:18.560
great but the thing the thing is

01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:20.480
that i wonder

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:24.000
what percentage of comics have it okay

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.360
the comic spirit meaning like everything

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.360
is about the joke there's a lot of guys

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:30.480
like like

01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:32.880
i would argue 100

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:35.920
john mulaney has the comic spirit

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:38.880
as as despite the businessman that he is

01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:40.480
yeah i think his whole intent and i

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:41.840
don't i really don't know john other

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:44.400
than a few passing hellos but

01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:47.360
everything i see about him is joke first

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:49.199
the fact that that royal watch thing he

01:44:49.199 --> 01:44:51.679
did with seth meyers i felt exactly like

01:44:51.679 --> 01:44:52.800
he did about because i was watching the

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:55.040
crown at the same time so like but what

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.679
percentage of comics big j overstand is

01:44:57.679 --> 01:44:58.960
joke first

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:00.159
yeah

01:45:00.159 --> 01:45:03.920
ari or oh arya's to a fault

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:07.360
yes yeah it's a major fault yeah uh and

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.000
he is upset with you when you don't get

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:10.800
it

01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:12.000
for sure

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.360
but sometimes i get it and it's

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:17.040
yeah

01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:18.000
you know

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.600
but uh so

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:22.480
by the way you're telling that to me who

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:24.880
i mean arya's

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:26.719
has done things to me not besides

01:45:26.719 --> 01:45:28.880
drugging me has done things to me where

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:30.480
i wish someone would [ __ ] drug me

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:33.360
with molly what you wish oh i love mine

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.239

01:45:34.239 --> 01:45:35.199
[ __ ]

01:45:35.199 --> 01:45:36.639
not after everyone just died from

01:45:36.639 --> 01:45:40.800
fentanyl true i know i'm off um but like

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:42.560

01:46:28.239 --> 01:46:30.400
with aries with kobe like

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:33.119
gotta go and look your amateur nope

01:46:33.119 --> 01:46:37.679
there you go it didn't uh 2004

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.639

01:46:42.639 --> 01:46:44.800
mine toss me up next to him

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:48.480

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.119
you got him yeah you got him barely

01:46:51.119 --> 01:46:53.280
though that's surprising as far as like

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:55.040
comedy first and being like sure like

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:57.520
that it took me a minute

01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:00.320
and then the longer it's gone on whoa

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.480
and the longer people have been upset i

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.480
did hold on i gotta justify what i'm

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:06.159
saying about okay okay yeah sorry i

01:47:06.159 --> 01:47:08.080
wanted to sound like i'm all right no no

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:09.440
no you know what we're done i think it's

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:11.280
a good point the kobe thing

01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:14.159
yeah yeah actually yeah [ __ ] him

01:47:14.159 --> 01:47:15.440
uh

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:17.119
no the the kobe thing like at first i

01:47:17.119 --> 01:47:19.199
was like this is kind of [ __ ] up

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:21.199
and then i just like

01:47:21.199 --> 01:47:22.400
obviously i'm friends with him so i

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:24.080
didn't like i wasn't like what the [ __ ]

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:25.840
are you yeah but like

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.440
uh

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:29.040
after like a couple days and then the

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.800
more anger it was bringing the more

01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:32.880
people like crying

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.400
and being like what the [ __ ] i was like

01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:36.140
it's starting to get funny like

01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:37.520
[Music]

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:39.520
like as soon as like a club was getting

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:42.639
like a bomb threat i was like

01:47:42.639 --> 01:47:45.679
that's a good one that was a good one

01:47:45.679 --> 01:47:46.800
i

01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:48.960
am back in therapy uh and i gotta be

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:51.199
dead honestly though i do online therapy

01:47:51.199 --> 01:47:53.360
and it is so much easier for me because

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.119
i don't end up resenting the therapy

01:47:55.119 --> 01:47:58.159
itself for me online therapy allows me

01:47:58.159 --> 01:48:00.239
the opportunity to do it when i want to

01:48:00.239 --> 01:48:02.320
and and then and by the way it's just

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.719
literally one hour of my day not a 30

01:48:04.719 --> 01:48:06.719
minute drive and then an hour or some

01:48:06.719 --> 01:48:07.760
time waiting because you want to get

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.199
there earlier and then a 30 or a minute

01:48:09.199 --> 01:48:10.880
drive in traffic that you got to try to

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:12.080
book in

01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:13.520
shoving your day that's a two hour

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:16.239
commitment here's why

i love better help better help has

01:48:18.719 --> 01:48:20.880
helped myself and several people i know

01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.560
get through some difficult times if

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.480
you're someone who feels like you need

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.560
to talk to a certified professional

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.960

video phone and even live chat sessions

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:37.440
with your therapist so you don't have to

01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.440
see anyone on camera if you don't want

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:41.600
to and by the way that is just as good

01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:43.119
as on camera's just as good as off

01:48:43.119 --> 01:48:44.800
camera because quite honestly i do it a

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:46.400
lot of times on my treadmill so i'm

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:48.239
killing two birds with one stone it's

01:48:48.239 --> 01:48:49.840
much more affordable than in-person

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.199
therapy and you can start communicating

01:48:51.199 --> 01:48:53.440
with your therapist in under 48 hours

01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:55.840
why invest in everything else and not

01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:57.360
your mind right

01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.040

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:01.440
invest in a better pillow a better

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:05.119
blanket a better car a better house dude

01:49:05.119 --> 01:49:06.880
the mind is the one thing that helps you

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:08.719
get all those things why not invest in

01:49:08.719 --> 01:49:11.280

bert we recently received our helix

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:25.520
mattress we put it in our guest bedroom

01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:27.760
and that has become the sleeping bedroom

01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:30.560
it was so easy to put together i

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:32.080
remember the days when you had to get a

01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:34.719
mattress on the top of your car and

01:49:34.719 --> 01:49:36.560
hold it on with your buddy and drive

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.719
slowest crap down monroe street and hope

01:49:38.719 --> 01:49:40.960
that it didn't fly off i got a mattress

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:42.159
at a place that was throwing away

01:49:42.159 --> 01:49:43.760
mattresses i was like free king-sized

01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:45.600
mattress who doesn't want that this was

01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.280
so easy it was delivered to our door in

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:49.600
a box we moved the box into the room

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.000
open the box unopened open the mattress

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.159
and it was literally set up within a

01:49:54.159 --> 01:49:55.760
matter of minutes and it is the most

01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:58.159
comfortable [ __ ] mattress you could

01:49:58.159 --> 01:50:00.800
ever imagine we fight to sleep in that

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:02.880
room my wife gets it every night and

01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.400
then i sleep

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:06.480
in the master bedroom because i snore

01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:08.320
and she gets and you can tell it's

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:11.119

i still remember i remember i remember

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:31.199
i remember his

01:51:31.199 --> 01:51:32.880
you know i don't i don't think any of

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:34.800
the [ __ ] outside stuff bothered him

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:36.880
at all what i think bothered him was the

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:39.920
insular comics not coming to it for sure

01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:41.840
and i and i was one of them i've lost a

01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:44.000
lot i lost a couple friends over snl

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.440
really yeah there's a lot of people that

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.880
like didn't

01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:48.800
stand up for me that they know i would

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:50.320
have done that for them

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:52.239
really yeah can you write their names

01:51:52.239 --> 01:51:53.440
down on a piece of paper so i know who

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:54.480
they are

01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:56.480
um

01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:57.920
it's funny because it's a weird thing

01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:00.800
like if when tom gets canceled and this

01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:03.199
will be soon yeah

01:52:03.199 --> 01:52:05.280
but no but like like there's you there

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:07.119
are some rider dies that you you kind of

01:52:07.119 --> 01:52:08.480
have to have

01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:09.440
you know

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:11.440
like but

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:13.280
the question is it's like i remember

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:15.520
watching people do it for people yeah i

01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.520

01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:19.920
out i remember watching

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:22.080
backup

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:25.840
and it backfired so bad that you're like

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.440
i actually don't know what you just

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:29.040
tweeted

01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:31.040
yeah that is true it's really [ __ ]

01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:32.400
fascinating and it still happens like

01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:33.679
i'll put out a special and then some

01:52:33.679 --> 01:52:36.080

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.280
that's really that's really interesting

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:50.000

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.360

01:53:02.639 --> 01:53:04.480
if i go on this podcast today with you

01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.599
certain subjects

01:53:07.599 --> 01:53:08.480
that

01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:10.400
what people will do is it'll get clipped

01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.159
out it'll be viewed millions of times

01:53:12.159 --> 01:53:13.520
and it's a great way to sell tickets

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:16.000
yeah it's just not the business i want

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.840
to be in yeah is

01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:18.960
and i and

01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:21.360
and you know and i've been caught up in

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.719
it i've done it on accident where you

01:53:22.719 --> 01:53:24.080
especially when you go on someone's show

01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:26.400
who's never met you and they can

01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:28.080
ask you questions because you don't know

01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:29.520
them yeah and then all of a sudden

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:30.960
they're like you're like that's not a

01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:32.880

like [ __ ] them they suck

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:16.800

there's

01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:36.880
i think there's a point in a career

01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:38.000
where you aren't getting the

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.760
opportunities you're seeing people that

01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:42.080
are your peers your exact age even

01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:43.760
younger than you getting opportunities

01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:45.920
and you're going like why the [ __ ] am i

01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:47.760
not getting these opportunities and you

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.760
friendship or

01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:19.280

01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:21.119
about himself in the industry yeah

01:56:21.119 --> 01:56:23.040

02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:53.119
[ __ ] but

02:09:53.119 --> 02:09:54.960
but uh she was a lot i was a [ __ ] who

02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:56.719
almost ruined it but yeah for real i

02:09:56.719 --> 02:09:58.079
mean her only animals got to a [ __ ]

02:09:58.079 --> 02:10:00.960
fight and then um

02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:02.159
but leanne

02:10:02.159 --> 02:10:05.119
is very almost like a serial killer is

02:10:05.119 --> 02:10:07.679
like very detached from the art she's

02:10:07.679 --> 02:10:10.079
seen it she knows it's good it's good

02:10:10.079 --> 02:10:11.520
we're gonna be fine

02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:14.159
and then she'll be like all right

02:10:14.159 --> 02:10:15.520
cut

02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:16.800

02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:20.400
like hold on are you sure it's so funny

02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:23.280
it's so funny to have like a family

02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:24.960
like so i don't have anybody so the

02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:26.960
special is just me yeah it's funny that

02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:28.400
you have like mouths to feed and you're

02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:29.840

02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:39.520
gonna lose everything i [ __ ] i think

02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:41.520
leanne i think part of leanne's uh

02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:44.000
detachment emotional emotional

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.920
detachment from the special is that she

02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:47.520
goes this is gonna pay this is how we

02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:49.199
make money for the next year and she

02:10:49.199 --> 02:10:50.480
just wants it to be the best it can be

02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:51.760
and she goes i know the material's good

02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:52.960
let's get to it

02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:55.679
cut this cut this cut this and wow like

02:10:55.679 --> 02:10:57.599
she'll be like i don't need it like

02:10:57.599 --> 02:10:59.520
really like really dismissive

02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:00.960
i'm like well i think that's a good part

02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:02.800
like there was a good chunk about our

02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:04.639
dogs and our cats in this in this

02:11:04.639 --> 02:11:05.599
special

02:11:05.599 --> 02:11:07.679
in the latin hey big boy she's like it's

02:11:07.679 --> 02:11:09.199
too long and i was like but they're your

02:11:09.199 --> 02:11:10.639
dogs and cats too

02:11:10.639 --> 02:11:12.239
like don't you i want them to get some

02:11:12.239 --> 02:11:15.679
attention and then she just is really

02:11:15.679 --> 02:11:17.840
she's really phenomenal at it and by the

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:20.639
way she did it with a cabin

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.560
she did it with um

02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:25.520
hey big boy secret time and the machine

02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:28.480
she edited all of them she's i i i give

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:30.239
notes like i ultimately i guess i have

02:11:30.239 --> 02:11:32.000
final call but i don't really know what

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.159
i'm seeing i know it's hard it's very i

02:11:34.159 --> 02:11:35.599

02:11:35.599 --> 02:11:37.280
this is the first time i've ever looked

02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:39.440
at a special but i was like i would

02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:41.040
write notes and be like what do you guys

02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:42.400

this joke or do without it i don't care

02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:46.320
what do you guys think and everybody

02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:47.920
would be like no it's your decision and

02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:48.960
i'd be like

02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:52.639
i i've said this a thousand times yeah i

02:11:52.639 --> 02:11:54.159
don't think it's funny

02:11:54.159 --> 02:11:55.440

02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:57.440

02:13:53.119 --> 02:13:56.400
getting hope and you go like you go okay

02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:58.320
that's not a good thing you know never

02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:00.880
one hope

02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:03.119
norm really yeah

02:14:03.119 --> 02:14:05.920
he's sorry but i go at the second pass i

02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:06.639
go

02:14:06.639 --> 02:14:08.880
oh this could be really good like if if

02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:11.119
i can figure out this chunks losing me

02:14:11.119 --> 02:14:12.800
if i can figure it out and luckily i

02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:14.800
shoot for specials you know what do you

02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:15.679
want to know

02:14:15.679 --> 02:14:17.040
what i

02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:19.280
had an epiphany so chappelle signs these

02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:22.480
deals for specials and he puts a lot of

02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:24.800
the money back into the special to make

02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:26.480
the special the best thing you said

02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:27.760
you've ever seen

02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:33.040
and in essence what i realized is he is

02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:36.000
cementing himself as the goat in comedy

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.760
because not a lot of comics are willing

02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:38.800
to say

02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:41.679
say netflix gives me 20 million dollars

02:14:41.679 --> 02:14:43.199
to go i'll make a 20 million dollar

02:14:43.199 --> 02:14:44.719
special

02:14:44.719 --> 02:14:47.119
and go a movie cost 20 million dollars

02:14:47.119 --> 02:14:49.199
why wouldn't we make it why wouldn't i

02:14:49.199 --> 02:14:50.880
film it as many times as i could why

02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:53.280
would i give myself the best swings at

02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:55.440
best at bats as possible why wouldn't i

02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:57.599
pick the best location so many times you

02:14:57.599 --> 02:14:59.440
get a location where they're like you

02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:00.480
should do this in chicago and you're

02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:02.320
like well i was just in chicago

02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:03.840
like three months ago and they're like

02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:05.520
that's fine it's fine and i go no that's

02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:08.079
not fine like i i i it's so funny i said

02:15:08.079 --> 02:15:09.440
it too

02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:10.960
rogan and i i said

02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:12.239
i'd like to do my special where no one's

02:15:12.239 --> 02:15:13.599
seen the material that's why i did it in

02:15:13.599 --> 02:15:15.840
austin yeah yeah i've never never did a

02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:17.440
weekend in austin it's like they laugh

02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:19.040
at the the first time yeah they're like

02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:20.239
you should do it in philly and i'm like

02:15:20.239 --> 02:15:23.119
i've i've run it in philly and

02:15:23.119 --> 02:15:25.599
even if they've like the audience there

02:15:25.599 --> 02:15:27.040
in my own head i'm like they've heard

02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:28.880
this and the second i think the audience

02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:30.400
has heard my material before i'm like

02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:32.320
this sucks the show sucks i would never

02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:33.679
go to a market and do the same material

02:15:33.679 --> 02:15:35.040
twice why would i

02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:37.040
shoot my special i have

02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:38.560
well yeah but you're you're young same

02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:40.239
i'm running the same hour

02:15:40.239 --> 02:15:43.040
i i i you you takes you 10 years right

02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:45.199
your first hour yeah and then

02:15:45.199 --> 02:15:46.800
i would argue another fives right your

02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:48.320
second that's exactly where i'm at that

02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:50.239
was like 10 years yeah 10 years i did my

02:15:50.239 --> 02:15:52.719
first special comfortably dumb

02:15:52.719 --> 02:15:55.840
um two or three bits i'm still i still

02:15:55.840 --> 02:15:57.840
i'm super proud of yeah but the majority

02:15:57.840 --> 02:15:59.280
of it's kind of like

02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:01.280
majority of it's the majority of it is

02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:03.920
not it's not my voice yet mm-hmm um the

02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:05.679
machine is

02:16:05.679 --> 02:16:07.599
more my voice than

02:16:07.599 --> 02:16:10.480
that one and then secret time is like

02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:12.560

even more my voice and i go but i need

02:16:18.079 --> 02:16:20.079
to like distance myself

02:16:20.079 --> 02:16:22.079
from my voice and make it the next one

02:16:22.079 --> 02:16:24.000

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.520
time between now and when i shoot my

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:27.119

02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:35.760
some days

02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:37.679
i was telling tom

02:17:37.679 --> 02:17:39.519
i told leanne the other day and i told

02:17:39.519 --> 02:17:40.880
tom and i didn't realize it was a bit

02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:42.800
and i told the anne and i realized oh

02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:45.679
this could be a bit but i misread words

02:17:45.679 --> 02:17:48.319
a lot so like i told tom that the story

02:17:48.319 --> 02:17:51.200
is it's true i was in a [ __ ] strip

02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:52.319
mall

02:17:52.319 --> 02:17:54.880
and uh and i had extra time and i know

02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:56.559
what to do yeah and i saw this place

02:17:56.559 --> 02:17:58.800
called beard brothers and i was like oh

02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:00.719
this i just trimmed the other day but i

02:18:00.719 --> 02:18:02.399
was like oh i actually need

02:18:02.399 --> 02:18:04.479
my beard trimmed i'm like and i'm not on

02:18:04.479 --> 02:18:06.240
tv for a while it's like i might

02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:07.920
actually go to a beard place and let

02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:10.639
them do it and see how they do it like

02:18:10.639 --> 02:18:11.760
and like

02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:12.880
normally i won't do it because i'm very

02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:14.000
particular about how i look on

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.960
television but i'm not on tv for like

02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:19.599
[ __ ] two months yeah three

02:18:19.599 --> 02:18:21.679
two months probably so i go i'm gonna

02:18:21.679 --> 02:18:23.519
let them do it and so i walked in and i

02:18:23.519 --> 02:18:25.599
was like this

02:18:25.599 --> 02:18:28.240
is not

02:18:28.639 --> 02:18:30.479
a barbershop

02:18:30.479 --> 02:18:34.080
i go this is a bakery yeah what the [ __ ]

02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:37.960
and then i look up and it says

02:18:39.359 --> 02:18:41.840
so i told it to leanne and i as i told

02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:45.040
it to leanne i went oh i can skinny this

02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:48.240
up that's a joke and and turn it into

02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:50.000
you know do you ever like to find it

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:51.920
find a way to skinny it up so it's not

02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:53.920
this that's my problem all my jokes are

02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:55.359
in story form

02:18:55.359 --> 02:18:57.200
like it's not a problem though people

02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:59.679
like that yeah but you're

02:18:59.679 --> 02:19:01.280
it's funny even you telling your story

02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:03.280
about your sister going to rehab

02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:05.519
is

02:19:05.679 --> 02:19:06.960
it's

02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:09.280
it's so good because it's not

02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:11.359
it doesn't feel like a story but it is a

02:19:11.359 --> 02:19:12.639
story but it doesn't feel like a

02:19:12.639 --> 02:19:14.479
stereotypical story you'll see some guys

02:19:14.479 --> 02:19:15.840
tell stories and you can see that

02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:17.359
they've they've watched people tell

02:19:17.359 --> 02:19:18.719
stories and they tell a story the way

02:19:18.719 --> 02:19:20.960
the other people tell stories you know

02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:22.479

is

02:25:53.359 --> 02:25:55.040
if i'm not mistaken he'd never been to

02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:56.319
south carolina and he'd never

02:25:56.319 --> 02:25:58.479
experienced southern race i mean how

02:25:58.479 --> 02:26:00.160

oddly enough not being able to swim is

02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:59.760

i had a chimp it was on a tv show called

02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:55.840
fresh baked video games

02:44:55.840 --> 02:44:57.680
and

02:44:57.680 --> 02:44:59.760
he was on my head and

02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:01.520
the trainer was like and he grabbed onto

02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:03.840
my ears and the trainer [ __ ] freaked

02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:06.319
out and the chimp locked down and i

02:45:06.319 --> 02:45:08.319
never felt strength like that like

02:45:08.319 --> 02:45:09.680
[ __ ] and he was like oh he would have

02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:10.960
just ripped your [ __ ] ears off then

02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:12.479
he would have bit your face

02:45:12.479 --> 02:45:14.560
but anyway back to trip flip back to

02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:16.160
trip flip

02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:17.040
we

02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:18.160
take this couple out in the middle the

02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:20.240
ocean put him in wetsuits

02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:22.160
give him flippers and i guess the guy

02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:24.160
thought the wetsuit would keep him

02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:25.600
buoyant

02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:27.040
and he didn't know how wetsuits work and

02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:30.080
he jumped in the ocean and just sank and

02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:31.840
my sound guy john sales ripped off his

02:45:31.840 --> 02:45:33.520
gear dove in the water after him and

02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:35.040
pulled him out of the [ __ ] drink and

02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:36.560
was like and the guy just popped up and

02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:38.800

natural like you would get in water and

02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:02.080

02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:09.200
unlearn how to swim

02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:10.479
no

02:48:10.479 --> 02:48:12.319
why not

02:48:12.319 --> 02:48:13.520
they'd be like getting the yips with

02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:15.520
like walking

02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:18.000
but the yips show up

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:19.600
swimming yeah if you were like a

02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:22.080
competitor define the yips to anyone the

02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:24.720
yips is uh

02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:25.920
i don't know the best way to describe it

02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:28.960
is like a let's say like a pitcher

02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:30.720
i i don't know it's time to type in type

02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:32.560
in the yips it's like so let's say like

02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:34.560
a starting quarterback carson wentz yeah

02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:36.399
carson wentz incredible quarterback for

02:48:36.399 --> 02:48:37.359
this he was

02:48:37.359 --> 02:48:39.920
he got he hurt his knee

02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:42.240
and then just kind of

02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:44.080
nice i said pitcher and that's the pit

02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:46.399
the hips are involuntary wrist spasms

02:48:46.399 --> 02:48:48.319
that occur most commonly when golfers

02:48:48.319 --> 02:48:50.560
are trying to putt however the yips can

02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:52.479
also affect people who play other sports

02:48:52.479 --> 02:48:54.160
such as cricket darts and baseball it

02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:55.520
was once thought that the yips were

02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:57.120
always associated with performance

02:48:57.120 --> 02:48:58.399
anxiety

02:48:58.399 --> 02:49:01.040
so the yips is a real thing

02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:04.000
type in examples of yips

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:07.200
is it the mayo's clinic

02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:11.120
yeah

02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:14.080
symptoms so the bottom the the google

02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:16.000
search was did chuck knoblach get over

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:17.200
the yips

02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:19.120
chuck knobbock had the ips i guess he

02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:20.640
must have been the number one it's oh so

02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:22.160
it's just in your wrist

02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:23.439
thank god so i was like i wonder if you

02:49:23.439 --> 02:49:25.439
get the yips from stand up yeah but it's

02:49:25.439 --> 02:49:27.359
also about your brain too the most it's

02:49:27.359 --> 02:49:29.040
a common thing symptom associated with

02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:31.200
the yips is an involuntary muscle jerk

02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:32.720
although some people

02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:35.200
experience tremors twitches spasms or

02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:37.040
freezing probably freezing is the one

02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:39.439
that so i had

02:49:39.439 --> 02:49:40.640
i had a

02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:44.000
mild version of the yips in high school

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:45.920
and it's and i couldn't play third base

02:49:45.920 --> 02:49:47.760
because of it

02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:51.520
but the yips for me were mental

and shaq and the rock have you seen this

02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:49.840

02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:53.120
look at how small the rock is

02:54:53.279 --> 02:54:55.439

i think all right that might be real

02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:06.800
the rock's a big man because barkley's

02:55:06.800 --> 02:55:10.479
six six it just said

02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:14.560

02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:16.560
okay he's in that's some no that's a

02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:18.160
pumped up hollywood number he's not

really six five okay if he was 6'5 he

02:55:20.479 --> 02:55:22.160
would have started at miami i've stood

02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:24.000
next to him and he's like

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:27.840
rock and mark wahlberg find out mark

02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:30.560
wahlberg's height real quick type in the

02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:31.760
because you know mark wahlberg's gotta

02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:33.359
be five nine five eight five eight yeah

02:55:33.359 --> 02:55:36.880
then mark wahlberg and the rock

02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:41.840
so five eight six five this better be

02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:43.359
monumental

02:55:43.359 --> 02:55:44.720
okay not in a movie because they're

02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:45.520
gonna

02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:46.880
okay that's that's right that's real

02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:49.920
walking garage looks preposterous that's

02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:52.319
real water just like a [ __ ] idiot

02:55:52.319 --> 02:55:53.760

02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:56.160

02:55:56.160 --> 02:55:59.160
anthony

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.640
anderson anthony mackie is a good

02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:03.680
laugher

02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:05.840
we did a we i did a show one of my one

02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:08.399
of my buddies omar dorsey was producing

02:56:08.399 --> 02:56:10.000
a show called the cut and it was

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:13.200
basically what we got

02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:14.399
that's a

02:56:14.399 --> 02:56:16.960
wahlberg the rock and shack okay that's

02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:19.040
the same picture just so we're clear the

02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:20.880
rock is not six rock's not even close to

02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:23.920
six five no if cause charles is six six

02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:25.279
and he's leaning

02:56:25.279 --> 02:56:27.279
and he's old so charles is probably

02:56:27.279 --> 02:56:29.200
taller than six six i could have sworn

02:56:29.200 --> 02:56:30.720
it was nice to be i know you'd think

02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:32.399
he'd be six nines hold on if mark

02:56:32.399 --> 02:56:34.240
wahlberg's charles barkley's height he

02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:35.760
can't be six six by the way i'm by the

02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:36.960
way i'm friends with the rocks so let's

02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:38.399
let's stop talking [ __ ] about the rock

02:56:38.399 --> 02:56:39.840
is he are you yeah you want to hear

02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:42.160
about his voice message no i saved it i

02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:44.160
saved it

02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:46.000
he said no

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:47.359
by the way i remember the first time i

02:56:47.359 --> 02:56:48.800
got retweeted by the rock i lost my

02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:51.920
goddamn [ __ ] really i lost my i've i've

02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:54.399
vocally been against the rock how could

02:56:54.399 --> 02:56:57.200
you possibly be vocally against a rock

02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:58.960
because he like brags about waking up

02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:01.520
early and lifting yeah

02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:05.040
okay so yeah they're not one inch apart

02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:07.520
but but that's that's his game i know

02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:09.920
that's his gig look it came from a place

02:57:09.920 --> 02:57:11.359
of insecurity

02:57:11.359 --> 02:57:14.720
clearly well oh well no i i do have

02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:17.040
i'm a little correct on something okay

02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:18.319
i'll tell you what i'm guilty of talking

02:57:18.319 --> 02:57:20.399
[ __ ] about kevin hart

02:57:20.399 --> 02:57:22.160
i talk [ __ ] about kevin hart but it but

02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:24.720
not talk [ __ ] it was meant to be a joke

02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:26.399
the same way i talked [ __ ] about

02:57:26.399 --> 02:57:28.960
i mentioned mullany and the same thing

02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:30.800
that rant that you do with friends
