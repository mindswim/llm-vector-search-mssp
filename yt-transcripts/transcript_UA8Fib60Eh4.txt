00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.400

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.200
i checked the website first and of

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.720
course it's like license plate

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.120
orvin i thought it said andvin so i had

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.559
to look up the [ __ ] vin number this

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:46.880
thing

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.880
oh type the vin number in because i told

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.080
you how'd you do that by the way

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.840
the vin number i had uh my insurance

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.720

uh typed in the vin and the license

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.799
plate so when i typed them both in i

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:00.159

00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:01.600

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.799
whatever i want whenever i want and i'm

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:25.840
trying to keep myself in charge how'd

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.360
you fight those teams

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.480

i'm gonna go yell at anybody i mean dude

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.840
i've been internally scrubbed

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.200
so radically that i just don't want to

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.720
freak people out so i want to slowly

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.480

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.600
so that's what i'm talking about but

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.080
anyway

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.200
the car is safe i got it it was towed

00:24:55.679 --> 00:24:57.760
hour i just went straight and got it

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.679

and it was and i blamed my my lady sure

00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:03.600
was her fault of course

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.039
we went to the flyers game last night we

00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:06.960

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.559
drew scored two goals in the final

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:10.000
minute to tie it awesome

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.600
the flyers won in a shootout what a

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.760
night oh what a night

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.240

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.159
i went back to the

00:25:22.159 --> 00:25:24.720
the exact bar for brunch to show that

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.960
that should show that fat [ __ ] waitress

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.799
that i don't care about her

00:25:28.799 --> 00:25:30.720
and i stared at her i sat there and went

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.440
could you please get me some coffee

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.200
i don't care how much she spit in my

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.760
drinks you just drank it all

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.919
right in her [ __ ] fat face dude i

00:25:39.919 --> 00:25:40.880

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.200
my friend adam was sitting across

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.159
and he he punched her he he was like she

00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:52.640

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.240
who she was locking horns with nothing

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.840
she saw me i look like a fat [ __ ] she

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.200

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.559
i could talk to this way

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.400
she thought and then it was just what'd

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.840
you say to me

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.240

to dump in front of my lady they

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.640
probably try to assassinate you via

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.600
diarrhea

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.640
yeah well they don't know they're

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.799
running into a buzz saw

00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:44.320
i was born in the darkness crafted by it

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.640
all right so [ __ ] i was battling

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.080
hipsters you

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.360
were battling your own ego pretty much

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:51.679
dude

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:53.520
listen so i'll start you from the

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.200
beginning yeah show up i talked to you i

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.559
remember about i forgot about that

00:27:56.559 --> 00:27:59.039
we talked on the way over yes um on the

00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:00.399
way over i was telling you about

00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:02.480
soplar and there's the other i think the

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.600
other technique where like if you

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.120
encounter oh yeah if you encounter an

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.440
entity you can either go

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.600
like push it away or if i think there's

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.720
that's so par

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.000
and there's another i forget the name of

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.320
it dude

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.640
torping yes yes that's it yeah i

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.320
remember that so if soplar doesn't work

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.600
this is like the youtubes i had watched

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.679
before now matt's talking about taking a

00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:23.679
five grand yeah mushroom journey so

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:25.120
while you're out of your body in the

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.799
asheville plane or you know wherever i

00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:27.600
was

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.000
i was watching videos right here in this

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.799
house hi

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:34.159
oh hi dude you're in your own brain dude

00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:36.799
yes that's a very nice perspective i've

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:38.080
been there that's a very materialist

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:38.720
perspective

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.159
i was at that i've been a bunch with you

00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:42.880
i would have easily i just would have

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.720
calmed the entire situation i had a nice

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.799
brunch and a nice calm brunch does not

00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:48.399
sound like if she walked by i said i'd

00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:50.080
like to kill you

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.880
very calmly i was going homely my body

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.559
was here i'd feel my body every now and

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:54.960
again

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.399
but on the way over i was telling you

00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:58.399
about soplar and torping

00:28:58.399 --> 00:29:00.000
and torping if soplar doesn't work if

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.120
the entities come around you and you go

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.480
you can you might that's kind of like a

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.000
gut punch they'll be like but you might

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.520
also attract the attention of larger

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.559
entities that things are

00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:10.399
part of a higher higher part exactly so

00:29:10.399 --> 00:29:11.760
you think

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.520
just i'll get to my belief not being a

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.279
jerk this is absolutely so there are

00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:18.559
there's a different dimension

00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:21.120
and there are entities that are very

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:21.840
possible yes

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.559
possibly entities that are like monsters

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:26.480
here's the thing

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.120
i believe in god now totally okay so i'm

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.159
not really worried about that kind of

00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:30.880
stuff

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.159
because i can just always call upon the

00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:33.919
one true creator okay no big deal so you

00:29:33.919 --> 00:29:34.960
can call on that there's people out

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.080
there who do deal with them i

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.200
i mean i might come across them i

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.440
haven't stopped my travels yet yeah but

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.279
it's like the technique this guy came up

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:44.240
with what i feared the most

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.240
oh 100 believe in god no not even

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.320
there's no people can say oh that's like

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.440
no i didn't fear that you would believe

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.840
in god what i feared that you'd be like

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.640
i haven't stopped my

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.240
travels yet i know i have not stopped

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.559
but

00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:57.840
all right i think i'm going to do like

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.679
every five year schedule i believe with

00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:01.200
some little treats in between obviously

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.559
some change you can get high as [ __ ]

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:03.520
occasionally too

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.360
i'm gonna i mean the weed deep dives are

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.960
probably on a whole new level now so you

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.279
think

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:10.159
the not you think i'm not sure but i

00:30:10.159 --> 00:30:11.840
like to imagine a dimension where

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.399
there's just monster like demons like

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:16.000
well it's an imminent it's an immaterial

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.120
and then all of a sudden they're like oh

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:17.840
[ __ ]

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.399
somebody's high as hell right now we

00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:21.039
gotta go

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:23.679
spook them

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.919
like yo this guy this doper's blowing

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:29.840
extra hard run everybody that's but

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.120
that's when you if you torp

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.559
soap oh [ __ ] he's torpin us when

00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:36.159
twarping is when you're there and the so

00:30:36.159 --> 00:30:37.840
the sopolar doesn't work but torping you

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.080
go

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.480
and then that that can kill them that

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.080
can kill them you kill them that could

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:46.960
kill them

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.760
you got to be careful because you're

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.039
still taking a life i mean it is you

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:51.360
know it's an immaterial dark energy body

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:51.760
but

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.640
they're not feeding on you because

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.840
you're high you have a light body as a

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.880
human being yeah

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.159
so you know it's like you're opening

00:30:56.159 --> 00:30:57.679
yourself up to different frequencies and

00:30:57.679 --> 00:30:58.960
your consciousness isn't in your brain

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.720
it's like an electromagnetic field it's

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.120
like

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.360
here's a magnet but there's also a field

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.960
your mind's in my opinion the same way

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.679
so it's like

00:31:05.679 --> 00:31:07.279
you just opened yourself up in my

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:09.120
opinion my humble opinion

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.039
yeah your humble opinion my humble me

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:12.399
you know rupert sheldrake and some of

00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:14.000
the greatest minds of the dark ages

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
medieval period yeah

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.399
great minds of the dark ages i mean dude

00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:19.840
yeah the great minds of

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.399
the noted worst time for minds that's

00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:24.159
probably that's history propaganda

00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:25.840
dark yet you know this dark ages weren't

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.200
as bad as people say there's a lot of

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.399
cool stuff happening

00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:31.279
definitely cool stuff a lot of cool art

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:32.640
come on give me that

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.399
give me the give you what cool art in

00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:36.080
the dark yeah sure don't fall into

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.600
history propaganda dude no i'm not

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.880
falling for the propaganda

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.600
i'm more worried about demons hiding you

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.720
don't have to worry about them dude

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.679
wait no they've visited me i've seen

00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:46.640
them they could

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.960
but i believe they were in my own mind

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.080
they could be i mean you're a

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.080
materialist that's what you would think

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.760
you know i don't like doing called

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.679
things here's the thing yeah

00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:57.279
it's not it's just a belief you know

00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:58.159
there's nothing wrong with it dude we

00:31:58.159 --> 00:31:59.200
need each other

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.039
but i mean to think that

00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:04.960
intelligence stops with us it's you know

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.080
to me it's a fallacy

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.080
it's like it very possibly is there's

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.600
larger and larger creatures and larger

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.039
levels of consciousness

00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:12.640
we're larger than an ant in terms of how

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.559
conscious we are to think that

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:15.679
yeah but that doesn't mean there's a

00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:17.760
dimension of monsters they're i mean

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.519
they could just be good i don't i mean

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:21.679
sure there could be aliens with higher

00:32:21.679 --> 00:32:23.440
levels of intelligence than us sure that

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:23.919
could

00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:25.120
you know that could kind of interact

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.880
with us mentally possibly i don't know

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.480
i'm saying i don't know i don't i don't

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.000
totally dismiss it

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.760
it might just all be in our heads that

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.279
that's on the table

00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:34.720
but dude if you witness what i witnessed

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.559
bro i did i just

00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:38.799
got very very high myself but you do you

00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:40.720
have to set the intention dude

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.480
i mean look i figured you did it better

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.000
than me no

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.679
don't start that i figured you knew how

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:47.360
to do it better no no

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.039
you started i i didn't start that you're

00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:50.399
right i know what you're doing here

00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:53.600
no you i started it i'm sorry i started

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.519
that for sure

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:58.720
i was the one who started that

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.480
no i'm telling you everyone can have

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.760
different experiences and again you have

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.640
to go into it

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.080
it all depends on your inherent belief

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.919
system i'm not saying you're wrong

00:33:05.919 --> 00:33:07.600
but for me a belief system is something

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.679
you choose that resonates with you

00:33:09.679 --> 00:33:11.679
that you get benefits from so if i were

00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:12.720
to say like

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.919
you know i want to believe i want to

00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:16.159
think like sam harris i can do that

00:33:16.159 --> 00:33:17.519
it just doesn't really make me feel that

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:19.440
good if i go into like

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.880
entities god all that stuff that pumps

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.080
me up it makes me feel

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.480
good so that's the one i pick you know

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.600
what i'm saying well of course that's

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.159
how that works

00:33:28.159 --> 00:33:30.640
yeah rules yeah but at the end of the

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.200
day

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.919
nobody knows for sure so it's like why

00:33:33.919 --> 00:33:34.880
would i pick one

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.159
that makes me feel like everything's

00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:38.799
totally pointless not doing that

00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:42.159
yeah god so par twerping

00:33:42.159 --> 00:33:45.919
let's go dude yeah i would not have

00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:47.279
been able to withstand that experience

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:49.360
without perfect faith dude

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.720
i would i was on the threshold i could

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.919
have been obliterated and i was just

00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:54.159
[ __ ]

00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:56.799
out of my body so you have perfect faith

00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:58.399
in the moment i had for compared to

00:33:58.399 --> 00:33:59.360
everything i had before

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.039
in that moment and you know you know i'm

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.880
not i'm a fallible creature

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.440
but i was able to fully i was able to

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.559
fully go you are

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:08.960
yeah of course oh [ __ ] dude i'm saying i

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.480
was able to transcend

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.320
possibly my greatest fear and i could

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.440
have went either way i mean you either

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.839
believe in fear you believe in god

00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:18.839
i chose the path of god it's that simple

00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:20.079
dude

00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:21.599
it's one dictates your life or the other

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:23.599
yeah you know what i mean

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:26.159
i was like i fear god dude you can't

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.520
that you should fear god homie so i

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.879
didn't get into the whole thing i fear

00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:30.320
god

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.359

00:34:31.359 --> 00:34:32.399
you're already kind of freaked out i'm

00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:33.520
just testing the waters

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.560
yeah i was in direct communication

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.919
i'm not saying like i was god or

00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:39.919
anything i got the full run down

00:34:39.919 --> 00:34:41.520
on how that all works and how we're all

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.359
like part of an organism basically

00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:44.240
that's just like

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:47.440
we can't even comprehend dude it was so

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.160
when i went to get into bed i laid on

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.440
top of the covers because i was like i

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.640

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.920
if i'm tripping i like feel trapped

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.640
under them yeah just neurotic thinking

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.920
um like as soon as i as soon as they

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.200
kicked in i you know i started bugging

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.640
out doing all this stuff

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.640
and all of that kind of like should i do

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.480
this should i do that it just got wiped

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.839
to the point now where it's like the

00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:08.000
idea of dancing i was laughing

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.920
being like the idea that i was

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.680
uncomfortable about that was just

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.280
the funniest thing in the world to me

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.280
uncomfortable about dancing yeah

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.640
i was just like that's the craziest [ __ ]

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.960
in the world or being like

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.400
i'm gonna pick this shirt because like a

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.599
dead guy i might have worn like all of

00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:22.079
that stuff

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:23.520
like i'm gonna stay on top it was like

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.880
get under the blankets you idiot and the

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.920
whole time was like

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.440
i'm gonna keep the mask on the entire

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.040
four hours and it was like

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.240
dude if you want to take it up take it

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.599
up you [ __ ] weird just [ __ ] like that

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:32.800
that's how i feel

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.200
yeah exactly it's not that's what i said

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.640
i don't you have some very non-neurotic

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.680
tendencies

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.240
um so so i'm laying there i thought i

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.520
had 40 minutes i talked to my brother

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.480
for a little bit

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.760
and then all of a sudden i'm like

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.720
alright dude like i'm just going to

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.000
start like close my eyes and breathe and

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:46.560
put the

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.280
put the mask on i had bluetooth i had a

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.880
mask with headphones hooked up to my

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.760
laptop

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.760
so i put it on and i start up like my

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.960
playlist is going

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.599
close my eyes and like and i start

00:37:57.599 --> 00:37:59.200
breathing and i just like as soon as

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.720
like it feels like something kind of

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.839
showed up because when your eyes are

00:38:01.839 --> 00:38:03.280
closed it's really weird to do like i'm

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.400
sitting there and all of a sudden it was

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.839
just like

00:38:05.839 --> 00:38:07.839
okay like yeah the effects are setting

00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:08.880
in

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.720
and i got like incredibly anxious and

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.320
was just like

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.160
[ __ ] dude [ __ ] like i was freaking i

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.440
started to kind of freak out and that

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.800
was the point i was like

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.160
you know you get all those thoughts like

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.520
i knew i shouldn't have done this i'm

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.720
gonna lose my [ __ ] mind

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.640
i'm gonna freak and it was just like i

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.240
had it out of nowhere i had this thought

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.359
it was just like

00:38:25.359 --> 00:38:27.119
dude your body's been dealing with fear

00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:29.040
before you were even a self

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.160
if that makes sense when you're a baby

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.599
you're not a self yet you're just like a

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:32.800
[ __ ] thing sure

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.880
so it's like you've been processing fear

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.720
there's no need for you to try to like

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.160
mitigate or be in the way of it just

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.920
like just completely let it go

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.920
so i'm like okay cool so i let that go

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.880
and then you know i'm still kind of

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.320
bugging out i'm this nap i feel a little

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.040
better

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.880
and then i'm like breathing tracking my

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.160
breath like following my breath and i'm

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.440
like in my head like i want to make sure

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.480
like i'm still breathing

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.839
because it's like starting to kick in

00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:53.359
it's like yeah and i have like you know

00:38:53.359 --> 00:38:54.960
my eyes closed and it's like

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.400
just like it was like the visuals are

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.320
more like stained glass windowy kind of

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.720
[ __ ] like almost like a

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.800
it'd be like a neon kind of like garden

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.000
it was weird but it's very faint it

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.599
wasn't super pronounced

00:39:05.599 --> 00:39:07.839
and then uh so then it was just kind of

00:39:07.839 --> 00:39:09.440
like like dude like

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.359
why why are you like keeping track of

00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:12.320
your breath it's like i want to make

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.160
sure i'm still breathing it's like dude

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.440
your body knows how to will you stop

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.200
with this weird [ __ ] [ __ ] just let it

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:17.680
go

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.960
and then i fully was like all right fine

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.720
it was like look you're nothing's gonna

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.160
happen you're gonna be back in one piece

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:22.800
like

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.400
you'll be fine you have to completely

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.240
give in so long story short

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.760
let go dude just become i just go it's

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.200
the way to i think like explain it is

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.680
just like it's a wave you just get like

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.200
carried off to the point where like i

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.640
would eventually i'm sure you know

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.760
you've done this

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.680
but you like i would touch my head for a

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.880
second like i would just be like

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.800
here hearing myself like oh like making

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.560
noises and i'd reach up

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.320
and you'd be like my head and you're

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.599
like oh i have a head like you just

00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:49.359
it's like when you're in virtual reality

00:39:49.359 --> 00:39:50.640
yes where you're like in this thing and

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.000
then you like accidentally touch a

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.800
counter

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.079
and you're like oh [ __ ] i forgot i was

00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:55.599
in this room yes this is exactly what it

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:56.079
was

00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:59.200
um and i

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.040
like kind of went off into like so the

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.960
anxiety stuff i was like examining all

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.560
the ways fear

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.560
kind of controls and dictates my life

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.000
and it like it went deeper than i

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.440
imagined and it was just like

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.040
so much [ __ ] popping up and i was like

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.119
what the [ __ ] that's crazy

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:14.880
that's this blah blah then i got like a

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.319
tremendous wave of anxiety and that's

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:17.760
when like the religious stuff

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.960
kind of can't started coming in because

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.400
my two intentions were to examine how

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.200
fear

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.200
dictates my life and to also start to

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.480
examine all the spiritual stuff i've

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.599
been reading about

00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:29.520
dude i went into like this

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.119
i i can't even explain it but it was

00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:33.040
like the whole life you're like the

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.440
whole mystic idea that like we are all

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.119
part of god and it's like almost like

00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:38.880
it's like a gigantic organism and we're

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.240
just kind of like individual cells

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.160
within this entire blah blah blah

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.040
so i was like in that idea if that's

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.560
like the easiest way to explain it

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.680
and i got to think the way

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.280
god thinks and it was overwhelming

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.280
terrifying and like lonely and just

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.040
weird i was like in eternity

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.079
by myself but being like this is what

00:40:58.079 --> 00:40:59.760
this is and being like this [ __ ]

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.400
sucks dude and i just got like i

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.000
remember just keep being i kept thinking

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.720
like

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.319
oh my god all i have to do is just take

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:08.079
care of such a little tiny piece of the

00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:09.599
world like my life and like you know my

00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:10.319
little [ __ ]

00:41:10.319 --> 00:41:12.480
web of relationships and i'm like i'm

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.839
such a [ __ ] and it just starts

00:41:13.839 --> 00:41:15.040
running through how i've been just a

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:15.520
[ __ ]

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.480
[ __ ] a [ __ ] letting this dictate

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.520
and it was just

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.160
[ __ ] brutal dude of just like you

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.000
like you have so little to deal with

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.520
and then like i would like you know i'm

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.440
in that i went through the whole christ

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.800
message and like this is what jesus was

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.240
trying to tell people and this is

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.319
how jesus's brain worked and i was just

00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:33.280
like

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.040
oh this is too much you know [ __ ] i knew

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.319
one of my people it was it was

00:41:36.319 --> 00:41:39.280
it sounds crazy but dude like that's and

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:39.760
it's almost

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.160
indescribable and then i would get spit

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.520
out if you'd get out like the wave would

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.200
be over and i'd be back in the room

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.880
and that's when i was like dude if you

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.760
want to get under the blankets get on

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.040
the blankets like pot was like

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.640
like immediately i heard tom come up the

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.560
stairs and i'm like

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.560
so i got this i think i'm done i think

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.079
it's over and he was like

00:41:56.079 --> 00:41:57.440
it's not over yeah like how long has it

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.920
been he's like it's been about

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.480
45 minutes and i was just like or like

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.680
an hour or whatever it was and i was

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.920
just like

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.400
okay and then mask back on i'm under the

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.839
blankies dude

00:42:09.839 --> 00:42:11.599
go into another wave it's the point

00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:13.680
where like i remember like going into

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.359
like the jesus stuff

00:42:15.359 --> 00:42:17.040
hitting like a buddha thing where i was

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.960
kind of like dude it was [ __ ]

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.640
nuts dude it was the point where like i

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.079
do remember

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:23.920
one of the things was like i had fully

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.680
like grocked the christ message

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.520
and then there was like jesus's eye

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.880
peering like this at me

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.079
and it was like you understand what i

00:42:30.079 --> 00:42:31.200
was dealing with and like that's what

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.400
i'm trying to tell people like

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.920
there's nothing to freak out about

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.599
literally it's all in your head it's all

00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:36.319
[ __ ]

00:42:36.319 --> 00:42:38.319
you're totally fine and it was like you

00:42:38.319 --> 00:42:39.599
know blah blah but if you tell this to

00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:40.800
people they'll want to kill you and i

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.760
was like oh [ __ ]

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.960
he's like but you have the message i was

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.880
like [ __ ] i was like no now you have

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.560
christ's message i didn't want it dude

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.560
i tried all of the saints they didn't

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.160
want it bro dude but here's the thing i

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.680
didn't want it i was aware of the whole

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.040
dynamic it was funny because at the time

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.079
i was going like

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:55.680
oh this is how people are convinced

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.440
they're jesus and i was kind of like

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.280
that's weird so i was still able to keep

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.040
some of my faculties

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.880
but the uh then i did this whole thing

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.079
with like the buddha thing and being

00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:05.280
like oh so that's

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.800
that's what nirvana feel and all of it

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.200
felt like scary it wasn't like oh i was

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.240
blissed out i'm like this is

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.240
overwhelming to think at this level

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.400
in this depth i'm like please send me

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.560
back to my just like stupid

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.480
like one cylinder brain where i can just

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.920
be nice like i just have all i have to

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.440
do is be good and be nice

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.599
so i would keep like being spit back out

00:43:23.599 --> 00:43:24.720
and it would just be like

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.560

and then i'd go back under so eventually

00:43:39.599 --> 00:43:41.119
what happened was

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:42.720
i get out of the religious stuff and

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.720
then i i start coming back into like the

world

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.720

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.920
go into

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.760
then i start coming to my senses kind of

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.200
but i go like

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.960

and i we went out on the deck so i'm

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.920
sitting outside just like this is

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.560
i remember being like because i was

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.839
going from the world so i'm like

00:45:53.839 --> 00:45:55.359
i'm in the city cars are going by and i

00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:56.800
remember just being like this is a lot

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.839
of activity dude

00:45:57.839 --> 00:45:59.359
there's a lot of people here and they're

00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:00.720
all [ __ ] on these like weird

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.599
hell-bent

00:46:01.599 --> 00:46:03.520
missions where they've been kind of like

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.440
co-opted into chasing this weird

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.640
material resource it was like

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.640
it was kind of a strange thing but the

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.040
uh but then we locked ourselves out i

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.400
shut the door behind me didn't realize

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.000
that it locked from the inside

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.520
so then i i'm like in my head i'm like

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.760
i'm good i turned to go back inside

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.079
and the door just was like the knob the

00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:21.920
lock we're just like

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.160
and i like look at it and was just like

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:24.960
and i thought

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.079
i thought i was hallucinating being

00:46:26.079 --> 00:46:28.240
outside so i turned to my brother

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.000
and he was frozen in time so i looked at

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.839
him yeah that's the word and he was just

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:33.200
and i was like dumb and he's like what i

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.760
was like i thought you froze

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.520
he was just like dude you got to go back

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.520
inside and i was like the doors doesn't

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:40.880
work and he was like what did you lock

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.400
us out and i was like

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.079
i think it does lock for me and like

00:46:44.079 --> 00:46:45.599
yeah he was like

00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:47.599
[ __ ] and it was cold so i'm outside the

00:46:47.599 --> 00:46:48.800
cold and i'm just sitting out there and

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.920
again it was like

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.599
i felt myself start to bug and my body

00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:52.960
was like dude if you want to bug bug

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:53.760
dude but like

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.160
that's on you and i was like yeah yeah

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.440
i'm not gonna bug and then he's like

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.800
spud's working around the corner

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.240
and again i just come out of like we

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.359
shouldn't have countries we shouldn't

00:47:01.359 --> 00:47:02.079
have money

00:47:02.079 --> 00:47:03.680
we shouldn't have locks so my head i'm

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.359
like [ __ ] hate locks dude i'm like

00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:06.640
this is why we shouldn't have this [ __ ]

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.040
so it's buddy i didn't even have a lock

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.480
so it's fun

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.560
spud comes and lets us in and i'm just

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.560
like this is why you have bros this is

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.920
why your bros are the best dude

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.280
you can lock yourself out you're bros

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.640
and just like i'm like yeah this is the

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.680
only thing that matters like you know

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.280
i'm going through all that stuff

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.280
and then i go back into bed i'm not even

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.359
done yes i'm halfway at this point he's

00:47:25.359 --> 00:47:26.079
like

00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:27.599
i'm like i think i'm gonna lay down i

00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:28.640
don't know if i'm ready yet he's like

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.920
you're not go lay down

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.319
so i lay down this is where it got like

00:47:32.319 --> 00:47:33.440
truly weird

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.839
so i i uh and this is like again this is

00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:37.119
the re-entry this is like i'm coming

00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:38.079
back to the world

00:47:38.079 --> 00:47:39.839
i lay down i laid down like i remember

00:47:39.839 --> 00:47:41.599
kind of crossing my legs like this like

00:47:41.599 --> 00:47:42.960
if you peep under here like a little

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.000
little grapevine yes just you know comfy

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.599
and instantly my brain is shot to like

00:47:47.599 --> 00:47:49.680
the dna helix and i'm like

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.440
dna tight and then all of a sudden it

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.720
started going into like

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.480
i had this like not a memory but i had

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.839
this like it sounds

00:47:55.839 --> 00:47:56.960
i thought this was the most profound

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.040
thing in the world i was like

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.160
[ __ ] dude i used to be a sperm cell and

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.319
i was just like

00:48:04.319 --> 00:48:06.559
well i was like i was in my dad and

00:48:06.559 --> 00:48:07.760
there was [ __ ]

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.520
millions of cells and i had a whole

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.599
other life as an organism that i don't

00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:13.680
even remember and i was just like

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.960
my brothers were in my dad i was like

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.319
whoa and then i started thinking about

00:48:18.319 --> 00:48:19.760
how my dad was in someone else and they

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.839
were in someone else and how like

00:48:21.839 --> 00:48:23.520
all of us were just emanating from this

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.119
uninterrupted life force and we just

00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:26.559
kind of all like popped up like a you

00:48:26.559 --> 00:48:27.920
know like a blade of grass or like our

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.440
whole personality was like

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.599
wallpaper on this like generic life

00:48:31.599 --> 00:48:33.520
force that we're all part of it was

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.839
pretty nuts dude and then i like

00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:37.520
couldn't tell i was like i was like

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:38.960
burdened with the knowledge that i was a

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.480
sperm cell and i didn't think anyone

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.839
else like i thought people had pushed it

00:48:41.839 --> 00:48:43.119
out of their mind i'm like

00:48:43.119 --> 00:48:44.640
i can't bring this back to people and

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.000
tell them they won't be able to take it

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:46.800
i thought i was like going to like

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.480
dismantle people's mental well-being by

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.119
being like

00:48:49.119 --> 00:48:51.760
damn sit down for this bro but you were

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.800
a sperm cell

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.160
yeah i thought people could i thought

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.680
that we all repressed it and forgot that

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.559
we were like

00:48:56.559 --> 00:48:58.720
basically tadpoles at one point living

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.160
in another person and also like

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.079
obviously we were living in her mom and

00:49:02.079 --> 00:49:04.880
we were also kind of living in our dad

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.559
sort of parts of us and then you know it

00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:08.800
was just like uh but the uh

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.160
so i went on that for a while and then

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.079
that kind of seeped into like this whole

00:49:12.079 --> 00:49:13.520
thing how like we i was thinking of

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.559
everyone i know and

00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:16.480
after i kind of like stripped myself

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.839
down to being like dude you're a [ __ ]

00:49:17.839 --> 00:49:19.280
[ __ ] about this you're not you should

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.559
be doing better with this person you

00:49:20.559 --> 00:49:21.839
should be you know just more just be

00:49:21.839 --> 00:49:23.440
nicer because a lot of my stuff is like

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.720
well this person would do this to me and

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.800
then it was just like [ __ ] you shut up

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.520
stop being a [ __ ] and then uh i was

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.559
like in this

00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:32.400
everyone i knew was like an island and i

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.400
was in the water and then we were like

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.920
basically we were just the water but the

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.280
island was us popping up as like our

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.480
personalities but we were all part of

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:39.599
the same thing and then

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:41.359
eventually i came to and thought i broke

00:49:41.359 --> 00:49:43.359
my brain and then i'd never be the same

00:49:43.359 --> 00:49:44.000
ever again

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.119
you know my brother was like now you're

00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:46.240
cool we're going to go out and get pizza

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.040
afterwards like

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.200
people like me still he's like yeah they

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.160
like you dude yeah

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.800
i was like i thought everyone hated me

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.319
like no you're fine like i thought i did

00:49:54.319 --> 00:49:54.960
a bad thing

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.680
like no you're fine so then i like laid

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.720
there for a while

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.319
and i was like i can't move and then

00:50:00.319 --> 00:50:02.079
finally in my head i was like i was like

00:50:02.079 --> 00:50:04.000
tom and he went he didn't come he would

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.800
want for a walk he wouldn't come

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.240
upstairs so i was like

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.319
you have to stand like that's when i got

00:50:08.319 --> 00:50:10.000
up and like pushed the door i had to pee

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.359
really bad but i couldn't get out of bed

00:50:11.359 --> 00:50:13.200
yeah so i went out of bed i peed and as

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.960
soon as i peed i was like

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.960
i'm back in my body because i was like

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.800
in my body but i wasn't working like i

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.839
thought it would

00:50:19.839 --> 00:50:22.079
and then i had another hour of just like

00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:23.760
chilling downstairs being like talking

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.040
to my brother being like

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.720
how do you [ __ ] function because he

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.480
had done it previously and i'm like

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.319
how do you even live now and he was like

00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:31.839
you'll be fine and then eventually

00:50:31.839 --> 00:50:33.440
i went for a ride i got a smoothie and

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.839
like that night it kind of wore off and

00:50:35.839 --> 00:50:36.720
i had a splitting headache

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.720

help because i was able to kind of like

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.720

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.599
is one thing it's for me it was the

00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:47.040
after effects have been

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.839
awesome yeah dude my i was i had like

00:53:49.839 --> 00:53:51.359
nothing but neurotic thinking patterns

00:53:51.359 --> 00:53:52.160
that have like

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.400
i forgot like so what happens is like

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.000
i'll wake up now

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.599
and and i didn't know i forgot i used to

00:53:57.599 --> 00:53:59.359
even do this i went to pee the other

00:53:59.359 --> 00:53:59.920
night

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.240
woke up to take a piss pissed and then

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.920
like i had like a flood of racing

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.280
thoughts about just like complete

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.240
nonsense

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.960
but i was going i remember being like oh

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.160
yeah i used to wake up in the middle of

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.240
the night and [ __ ] freak out

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.680
like four nights a week i'd wake up and

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.800
be like and i was like that like

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.480
all the time i didn't i was something i

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.599
like would happen to me in the middle of

00:54:19.599 --> 00:54:20.640
the night and i would just put it out of

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.920
my mind and go back to bed

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.839
and i would just be like oh what i gotta

00:54:23.839 --> 00:54:25.359
do tomorrow but i'll just think about

00:54:25.359 --> 00:54:26.800
like 40 things at once while i'm peeing

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.160
and like just freak out and go back to

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:28.880
bed yeah

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.119
that started to happen i was just like

00:54:31.119 --> 00:54:32.240
huh

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.319
[ __ ] man and then i started going dude i

00:54:34.319 --> 00:54:35.359

00:54:38.319 --> 00:54:39.200
dude i like

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.000
erased just i move it was just like um

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.280
like there was like a ton of plugins

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.240
like you're you know you have like your

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.839
ego and it's a good thing to have it's

00:54:47.839 --> 00:54:49.040
like keeps you from dying and stuff but

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:49.599
like

00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:50.880
there's like you know don't get eaten by

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.480
a bear don't get murdered by your

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.280
neighbor

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.960
they're like good programs to run and

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.559
then it's like

00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:59.040
there's like a plug-in that's like is

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.400
your boss mad at me

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.000
is my wife mad they're the ones that

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.599
trigger that same limbic system and it's

00:55:03.599 --> 00:55:03.839
like

00:55:03.839 --> 00:55:06.000
i had like i was running like thousands

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.720
of plug-ins unnecessarily that just got

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.480
just kind of pulled off why what do you

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.160
think i just was anxious and neurotic

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.680
dude yeah it was just that's

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.119
that's just what happens it's like if

00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:17.280
you have an employee and their job is

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.319
you know

00:55:18.319 --> 00:55:20.240
it's not as important as it's important

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.440
but you don't they're not they shouldn't

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.319
be running the show

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:24.000
they'll invent things to do to keep

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.520
themselves more relevant and important

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.119
yeah so the ego thrives on problems so

00:55:27.119 --> 00:55:28.640
they just constantly invent problems and

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.760
that was the thing that bugged me out

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.359
too i was like

00:55:31.359 --> 00:55:33.119
why are we [ __ ] giving kids math

00:55:33.119 --> 00:55:34.480
problems dude we have enough [ __ ] going

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.160
on we're [ __ ] just inventing [ __ ]

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.240
i invent [ __ ] i was in math and they

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.680
made me [ __ ] just figure out [ __ ]

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:40.720
that wasn't even [ __ ]

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.440
i was dude it was nuts it was [ __ ] up

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.880
like really [ __ ] shit's hard enough

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:45.280
dude

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.640
you don't gotta just be confusing kids

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:47.599
with [ __ ] numbers they don't

00:55:47.599 --> 00:55:48.319
understand

00:55:48.319 --> 00:55:49.680
yeah it's like that doesn't exist just

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.880
[ __ ] delete it from the textbook math

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.119
i was like it's good to know but come on

00:55:55.119 --> 00:55:56.720
man yeah you shouldn't have to do that

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.359
[ __ ]

00:55:57.359 --> 00:55:58.720
yeah i started thinking about i should

00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.400
be able to tell who's dumb

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.520
well i started thinking about that i'm

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.640
like that's [ __ ] up man they just put

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.839
that [ __ ] on people dude

00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:05.680
pythagoreans i was just a celtic warrior

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.680
obviously pythagoreans were just came

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.240
they're like

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.440
do you even know how to count i was like

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.119
what the [ __ ] are you talking about dude

00:56:11.119 --> 00:56:12.480
no what do you mean

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.119
i know how many wives i have that's what

00:56:15.119 --> 00:56:16.079
everyone did they were just like three

00:56:16.079 --> 00:56:17.520
year olds they were just like

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.640
how old are you yeah they'd have sticks

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.680
put them on the ground that many like

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.599
i've been marking a rock i think every

00:56:25.599 --> 00:56:27.119
four moons but

00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:28.559
give or take they're like dude you

00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:30.799
[ __ ] suck you even notice the stars

00:56:30.799 --> 00:56:31.760
revolve and you're like

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.319
stop [ __ ] around dude like we own you

00:56:34.319 --> 00:56:34.799
now

00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:36.880
[ __ ] now your [ __ ] great great great

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.400
grandkids have to crack math problems

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:39.520
dudes [ __ ] yeah

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:43.520
[ __ ] dude so you feel like

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.480
it was good yeah and you feel better

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.200
than you did

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.559
yeah but i will say this there's a

00:56:48.559 --> 00:56:50.640
caveat because

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.079
i could see how you could [ __ ] spin

00:56:54.079 --> 00:56:54.400
out

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.079
afterwards because it's a big change and

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.359
it's it's one of those things where it's

00:56:57.359 --> 00:56:58.400
like

00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.520
i had to come to grips with the fact

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.040
that i'll probably never be the exactly

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:01.839
the same

00:57:01.839 --> 00:57:03.280
and that's kind of scary i think you

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.599
will i don't think so dude i think oh

00:57:05.599 --> 00:57:07.680
at least i did i i think so they kind of

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.440
wore off a little after a couple days

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.520
yeah because the first two or three days

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.799
you're like oh

00:57:12.799 --> 00:57:14.960
[ __ ] yeah like definitely for the first

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.359
day like i went out to lunch and

00:57:17.359 --> 00:57:18.960
i was out to dinner with my girl and she

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.880
was like are you all right yeah you're

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.160
like yeah i'm fine that makes you feel

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.000
worse yeah for sure i was getting that

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:24.640
the next

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.160
the day of like are you sure you're fine

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.240
and i'm like if i had a bad headache

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.079
dude i had to go take a hot bath

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:32.240
and i read dune that was my turn red

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.400
dude in the bathtub and was just like

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.240
nothing but like mother trained my

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.079
consciousness i'm like [ __ ] yes dude i'm

00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:38.480
back

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.880
yes back online i honestly do they've

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.079
they've done mark they've done studies

00:57:42.079 --> 00:57:43.440
with this and apparently they're

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.280
this can have lasting personality

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.200
changes for up to like 18 months

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.839
studying from like you know uh life

00:57:49.839 --> 00:57:51.440
contentment indexes and all that stuff

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.119
and dude it's like

00:57:53.119 --> 00:57:55.280
there's the [ __ ] that i wiped off it's

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.640
like i and it's not like i'm not saying

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.839
like oh it's all gone like everything's

00:57:57.839 --> 00:57:58.559
perfect

00:57:58.559 --> 00:58:00.400
it still pops up but it's like a thin

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.599
vapor compared to what

00:58:01.599 --> 00:58:03.920
before it would be like my reaction was

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:04.720
physical

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.640
mental now it's like a fleeting thought

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.079
that i'm like oh

00:58:08.079 --> 00:58:09.280
like you know britney will be pissed

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.640
about something and i used to just be

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.280
like

00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.799
you know like we're on an airplane one

00:58:12.799 --> 00:58:14.640
of the motors starts smoking i'm just

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:15.520
[ __ ]

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.880
the whole plane starts blowing up i'm

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.040
like what the [ __ ] why are you [ __ ]

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:19.599
angry

00:58:19.599 --> 00:58:21.200
what the [ __ ] and it you know we just

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.960
explode rather than just being like

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.880
sorry you feel this way yeah i'm here

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.640
without i used to [ __ ] implode

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.559
so far that's not been the case you know

00:58:28.559 --> 00:58:30.559
so it's like there's it's it's help but

00:58:30.559 --> 00:58:31.280
i'm also

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.760
i'll say i was so neurotic it's almost

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.200
like you know when you weigh like 500

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.200
pounds like i lost 200 pounds like well

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.559
you're still 300 pounds bro yeah

00:58:38.559 --> 00:58:40.480
i'm like mentally 300 pounds from 500 so

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.920
it's like pretty tight

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:45.280
that is good yeah yeah it's it's funny

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.880
to take go on a mushroom journey just to

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.880
like be able to

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.920
listen to your wife nag it's coming out

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.400
be like

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.319
whoa dude and then your wife's like did

00:58:54.319 --> 00:58:56.319
you put this away you're like

00:58:56.319 --> 00:58:59.599
it's the ultimate dude just you

00:58:59.599 --> 00:59:03.280
know your wife's nags every man in my

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.880
family the mission now is

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.040
the whole family survive the women we're

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.720
gonna get the whole family just [ __ ]

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:11.599
celtic warriored up dude we could change

00:59:11.599 --> 00:59:12.960
we could alter the future of my entire

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:13.680
family line

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.280
yeah all the men of the family had done

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:16.799
the heroic dose

00:59:16.799 --> 00:59:18.400
and again it's under if you do it with

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.760
the blindfold with intention it's a

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:20.720
different experience

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.440
i believe it so my experience i thought

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.160

01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:36.079
thing dude

it's it's not a lot of people think that

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.839

01:00:39.839 --> 01:00:41.359

01:00:41.359 --> 01:00:43.040
god's there for your benefit dude not

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.400

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.160
knock yourself out yeah the people are

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.520
like i believe in them just in case it's

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.880
like nah that ain't it

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.319
you could do it that's not it obviously

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:53.920
forgives you for that but yeah

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.599
is that how you do it yeah i got really

01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:56.799
[ __ ] up about oh that was another

01:00:56.799 --> 01:00:57.599
thing dude

01:00:57.599 --> 01:00:59.040
i went through a whole thing of like

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.640
church and organized religion

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.440
and was just like [ __ ] dude this is so

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.079
shitty

01:01:04.079 --> 01:01:05.680
this is so [ __ ] up and like especially

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.200
how they won't they were condemning gay

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.119
people i was like i had this whole

01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:11.440
thing of sin and i'm like it's just like

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.119
you just match up two consenting parties

01:01:13.119 --> 01:01:14.319
it's cool and if you get in the way of

01:01:14.319 --> 01:01:15.359
that you're a sinner

01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:16.960
so i was just like [ __ ] dude the church

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.319
is so satanic dude with this [ __ ]

01:01:18.319 --> 01:01:19.200
they're doing all the shame they're

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.880
putting on people all that [ __ ]

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.640
that was like my the way i was thinking

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.799
about it it's like going to organize

01:01:24.799 --> 01:01:25.839
religion versus

01:01:25.839 --> 01:01:27.520
doing the heroic dose with you know with

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.119
a spiritual outlook obviously preparing

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:29.920
yourself

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.440
it's like drinking coke versus owning

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.119
stock and coca-cola it's like

01:01:33.119 --> 01:01:34.640
you can sip it or you can be like i

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.839
don't have a piece of paper you know

01:01:35.839 --> 01:01:36.960
yeah meaningless

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.799
but dude i started getting into like

01:01:38.799 --> 01:01:40.000
because again i was like yo we're all

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.760
part of this divine creature and i was

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.319
like

01:01:42.319 --> 01:01:43.680
oh there's like some of us just like

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.280
changing from boys into girls and i was

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:45.680
like

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.880
whoa that's so [ __ ] heavy dude i was

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:49.119
like

01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:51.760
what trains yeah i was like what are we

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.440
doing right now i was like

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.799
i was like it's just part of the process

01:01:54.799 --> 01:01:56.880
dude and i was like oh

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.200
what process i don't know just us

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.480
constantly morphing i don't know

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.920
it was just the whole thing was free i

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.280
was getting i was like that's me in the

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.640
church tell gay people to go to hell and

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.039
i did

01:02:05.039 --> 01:02:07.520
but there was the thing was was like i

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.240

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.760

like dude we have life inside of us i

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.680

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.880
weird about where you come and what

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:15.839

01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:22.160
bit on the gays yeah

cool

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.839

very excited i'll be so good that was

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.079
the only thing it was like

01:05:44.079 --> 01:05:45.440
that was the thing too when i was in the

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.280
very beginning of it and i was like

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.200
in that like weird divinity mode where

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.039
i'm like they're getting the rundown on

01:05:51.039 --> 01:05:52.720
how like god works and like what

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.319
infinity is and like what

01:05:54.319 --> 01:05:57.039
eternity is and i'm like god this is so

01:05:57.039 --> 01:05:58.480
[ __ ] much to deal with i'm like this

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.079
is like [ __ ] terrifying i'm like it's

01:06:00.079 --> 01:06:00.720
just you

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.480
i was like yup like that was kind of the

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.520
message i was getting i'm like that's

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.760
[ __ ] lonely and i felt just like

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.440
like i was i felt like i was alone

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.880
forever and it was a horrible feeling

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.520
that's hell

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.039
it was bad dude no that's what the

01:06:11.039 --> 01:06:12.799
catholic church teaches hell is

01:06:12.799 --> 01:06:14.240
well that's what god's up to bro he's up

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.599
there by himself it's pretty [ __ ] sad

01:06:15.599 --> 01:06:16.559
but that's why i have to be nice to him

01:06:16.559 --> 01:06:18.319
and send him good thoughts but

01:06:18.319 --> 01:06:21.119
dude the uh and there was a part two

01:06:21.119 --> 01:06:22.079
where i had the whole thing the whole

01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:23.839
idea like god are we in the devil as i

01:06:23.839 --> 01:06:25.280
like you alone are the devil but if

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.559
you're with your boys you guys are all

01:06:26.559 --> 01:06:27.119
good whatever

01:06:27.119 --> 01:06:28.079
no big deal i'm probably gonna write a

01:06:28.079 --> 01:06:30.400
book about it but the uh

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.960
there was one there was one i told you

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.000
dude i came back

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.079
i rolled the dice hard and you know stay

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:37.599
guys dude

01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:41.280
i got [ __ ] on this deal dude damn it

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.359
no it's good it's all good but dude

01:06:43.359 --> 01:06:44.319
there was a

01:06:44.319 --> 01:06:45.760
there was a part i was running through

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.119
the internet i was like why do we have

01:06:47.119 --> 01:06:47.760
to be good

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.599
and it was like it's like imagine

01:06:49.599 --> 01:06:50.799
running through the infinite

01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:52.480
like the infinite possibilities and

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.480
running every single possible action you

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.359
could do

01:06:55.359 --> 01:06:56.559
the only thing that works is if people

01:06:56.559 --> 01:06:58.160
be good if you're [ __ ] bad everything

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:58.880
is [ __ ] up

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.240
i was like oh that makes sense and i

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.799
just wake up and be like i'm gonna be so

01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:05.200
good and be like

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.079
bug mode dude for like four hours so

01:07:08.079 --> 01:07:09.359
that's it dude that was a hotel pretty

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.640
tight well that's awesome

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.559
yeah that is cool it's a lot i was

01:07:12.559 --> 01:07:14.000
nervous i was going to botch it but it

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:14.400
was like

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.839
there's no way to botch it you're just

01:07:15.839 --> 01:07:17.520
doing drugs

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.440
come on man no i mean disrespect my

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.280
religion dude no no no it's psychedelic

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.240
christian please don't

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.599
no no no you're right you're right but

01:07:23.599 --> 01:07:25.039
you are just doing drugs you literally

01:07:25.039 --> 01:07:26.319
can't botch it it's up to

01:07:26.319 --> 01:07:29.039
the brain you're taking a bunch of drugs

01:07:29.039 --> 01:07:30.319
now you can have a bad trip

01:07:30.319 --> 01:07:34.079
and have a shitty time but that's true

01:07:34.079 --> 01:07:35.520
it's up to you i would say it's an

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.280
experience either way like i had a

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.240
[ __ ]

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.079
gnarly trip and it was still a cool

01:07:40.079 --> 01:07:41.680
experience good to do yeah i see what

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.319
you're saying

01:07:42.319 --> 01:07:44.559
there's no [ __ ] it up now if you took

01:07:44.559 --> 01:07:45.920
your clothes off and like [ __ ] in your

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:47.200
hand or something

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.640
that would be a bit of a failure yeah

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.920
sure that would be a lot i hear your

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.359
point it'll be a slight letdown

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:53.200
yeah you can also just [ __ ] it up by

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.799
just doing it at a place that's just not

01:07:54.799 --> 01:07:55.520
like

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.240
not in the spot i can't i do hats off

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.680
people who do that [ __ ] at concerts

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:02.160
oh my god i would [ __ ] suffocate how

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.920
around like a thousand people

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.319
dude i mean if it was a lower dose like

01:08:06.319 --> 01:08:07.520
you know you just i could just walk

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.119
around in like jesus mode yeah i'd be

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:10.640
cool i guess but like

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.720
not that much dude where i start losing

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:13.680
track of like people

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.000

i'm [ __ ] i'm a piece of [ __ ] apparently

01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:08.239
i learned about myself i'm a piece of

01:10:08.239 --> 01:10:08.800
[ __ ]

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.400
that was that was a tough i was lucky

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.400
that i went into it knowing that

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.880
about myself i kind of knew i was but i

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.280
didn't know to the extent and that was

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:17.600
like

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.400
oh my god i didn't know 95 of my

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.280
thoughts were just

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.199
first of all nonsense really that was

01:10:23.199 --> 01:10:25.199
the weirdest part it was just like

01:10:25.199 --> 01:10:26.640
dude this [ __ ] i'll sit around and be

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.159
like well i don't know but if that

01:10:28.159 --> 01:10:29.040
happens i'll do that

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.880
it's just oh really [ __ ] [ __ ] i'm

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.880
jerking off then it was like

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.480
well this and then it's like you're just

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.480
a [ __ ] dude that's all it boils down to

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.480
as long as you're honest you're probably

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.520
if someone has a problem with you

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.880
you're being honest it's you know

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.400
whatever that's just a problem but yeah

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.360
being i was just like

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.199
in so many aspects such a little [ __ ]

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:46.400
