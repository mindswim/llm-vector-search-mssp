everyone that hears me at first i'm a

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.080
tough pill to swallow the problem is

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.200
everyone else that you're dealing with

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.519

they try to [ __ ] softball it in they

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.680
try to tiptoe around the issues i shove

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.879
it down your [ __ ] throat and people

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.239
aren't ready for that at first

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.160
when i first met you i was like oh i

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.000

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.800
exist without louis on several levels

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.000
but mostly

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.920
i mean

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.080
fifty percent if not way more of our

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.319
content is about something lewis has

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.159
done ridiculous and you need somebody in

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.760
your life you need a lewis j gomez i

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.599
know it's a double-edged sword hard man

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.360
yeah what's double-edged about it you

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.280
think because it comes with a lot of

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.239

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.479
taking off i know can i

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.000
mcdonald's told you they were closed and

you told me you were kicking the door

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.639

out of that [ __ ] no no

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:47.759

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.759
saying lewis is going the mail's not

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.440

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.960
[ __ ] that's a nice old god you're so

slick dude ready are you ready mind free

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.560
um the ridge wall it's like a good

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.720
wallet i like it it sucks for cash

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.840
they're not sponsored they're not

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.440
sponsoring the show i have no reason to

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.039
say i like it why haven't you got why

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:28.400
haven't you gotten the one that has the

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.840
money clip because that rubber band

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.919
sucks balls i don't really keep cash on

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.840
me that much that it matters to me

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.560
i keep cash separately in a little wad

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.680
actually not even usually it's just a

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.680
bunch of bunched up balls in my pocket

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.199
with a bunch of change now think about

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.960
if you had a money clip

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.919
um

i still wouldn't use it like i said i

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.919
have this technically this clip is fine

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:54.080
it sucks yeah i guess because money's

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.080
bigger than that or you have to fold

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.120

i think you have to be like an

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.240
entertainment assumption you have to do

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.320

base financial thing

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:29.120

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:33.440
think that's how i think it's because

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.120
direct recommendation and stuff i guess

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.800
they could do one that's actually a good

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.720
idea for a dating app where they you do

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.480
a credit check and a background check

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.000
and it's based off of like you're

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.279
actually having good credit and making

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:44.720

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.800
just not handsome he's kind of i think

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.920
he's gotten a little out of shape from

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.519
what he would but at one point

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:13.279
he works out all the time like at least

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:14.959

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:16.480

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.120
like tell me what you have after this

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.960
pose yeah i mean

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.240
you're like do something else i'm just

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.320
like i'm not a model i don't even know

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.320
what to do i'll tell you head shots i

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.320
don't even [ __ ] either it's the worst

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.559
you just do by the way q lost weight cut

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:15.679
his hair uh very handsome fella

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:18.320
yeah whenever we lose weight we we we

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.559
look much better like but usually fat

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:22.240
[ __ ] on there like i i've been fat on

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.440
there the whole time really it's like

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.640
two seasons yeah but it's great it

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.919
doesn't even matter though because you

00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:27.679
guys are [ __ ] you're with those other

00:18:27.679 --> 00:18:30.559
fatties so that's the move right there

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:32.720
if they joe went and lost your [ __ ] 40

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.600
50 pounds then q lost it now i'm on the

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.520
decline but i i shot that guy we

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.600
ping-pong okay there he is that's that's

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.280
very uh that's not a good that's when he

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.880
first shaved it off i'm saying now that

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.120
he has his hair like styled

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.640
and it's just sure but you guys are all

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.440
likable funny dudes yeah and that's like

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.440
look you're all [ __ ] you know in your

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.960
own things i'm sure and living your

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.280
lives and [ __ ] but if you want to go

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.600
crush some midwest puss at any given

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.960
moment sally boy you could have a

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.960
[ __ ] line of imagine that great

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.400
effects we find out sal is he's just

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.559
like a straight up [ __ ]

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:07.039
[ __ ] slayer oh dude i'm telling you

00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:08.960
though i mean it's got to be that would

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.200
make sense but there's probably like uh

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.880
there's probably tens whipping it at

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.600
them

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.280
on a pretty regular basis and practical

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.640
joker's tens are a little different than

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.919
the real world tense there's real

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:19.440
there's no there's both sets of tense

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.360
but not not only i'm not saying but when

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.200
you know i resent when when the real

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.000
world tends come at me i resent it

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.520
yeah because i'm like you wouldn't come

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.200
at me i used to argue that all the time

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.840
i remember travis poston t-bird used to

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.360
say he wanted to get famous so he could

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.960
[ __ ] all the girls that wouldn't [ __ ]

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.919
him

00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:37.760
like in high school and stuff yeah and

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.880
then my immediate reaction to that was i

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.320
was like man the exact opposite i want

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.720
to tell those girls to [ __ ] off yeah i'm

hilarious and i believe hold on i

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.559
wouldn't disparage a woman for dating

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:26.480
and marrying he's hilarious and he's a

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.520
genius and that quality women are into

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.600
that and and being rich or famous on

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.720
that level it really it it well that was

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.159
the conversation we were just having

00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:37.679
you're like what do you want on a scale

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:39.919
of one to ten with sal's questions like

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:41.280
are you talking someone who know who

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.080
like

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.080
knows me and what i do right or are you

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.280
talking about someone look passing

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.080
around

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.679
it's a different thing just swipe left

00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:48.960
yeah there's two numbers right because

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.320
if someone falls in love with you i

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.440
believe no matter what you look like

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.559
people can think you're beautiful and

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:54.159
gorgeous because they fall in love with

00:21:54.159 --> 00:21:55.200
you they have an emotional connection

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.640
then they look at you differently so it

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.000
doesn't it doesn't matter about like

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.280
what you look to other people i wasted a

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.840
lot of time questioning a hot chick

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.080
like saying she was into me i spent a

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.120
lot waste a lot of time questioning

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.000
going shut up it's just no there's

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.200
nothing left to try and they're like a

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.120
woman there's nothing less attractive to

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.280
a woman i'm sure you're questioning her

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.440
being attracted to you it's like you won

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.520

00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:12.400
jokes that aren't as well worked out it

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.240

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.679
new part of the joke that i was working

00:26:15.679 --> 00:26:16.960

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:22.559
things you really like

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:25.440
yeah and um yeah but the reality is

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.120
we're very self-conscious about it

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.960
nobody else notices that type of [ __ ]

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.760
and

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.520
listen i would say to you

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.250

00:26:36.799 --> 00:26:39.279
great yeah uh so funny i watched it and

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:42.159
then i saw my parents uh a couple weeks

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:44.400
ago and i was showing it to them and the

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.679
second time around you watch you just

00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:47.840
see like he just says um so much yeah

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.440
like oh man he says

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.520
but that's also his style he's not

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.360
always in his style no everyone else

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.720
just left because same thing when i

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.000
first watched it

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.360
the second time i'm watching i know the

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.880
jokes you're looking at the technique

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.400
same exact thing i did i watched the

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.520
first time left all the way through

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.880
watch the second time and started

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.159
noticing like patterns and stuff yeah

00:27:04.159 --> 00:27:05.760
you're like uh of course and you can do

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.200
it for anybody anybody

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.320

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.679
chappelle like that whole knee slap

00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:11.279

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:13.120
that whole thing is crazy he knows he's

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.640

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:20.320
laugh and chappelle in foreign opinion

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.159
might be the best living comedian i can

00:27:22.159 --> 00:27:23.679
tell it's up for debate to tell

00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:24.640

long do you have how long does it last

00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:22.000
you couldn't throw a problematic four or

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.119

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:30.000
[ __ ] can we get the air on um it's not

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.839

would be that uh testicle it works

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.760
pretty quick all right

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.520

but i i feel like your next your next

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.560
few boners even the next day or the day

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.159
after morning after i think when you

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.599
wake up in the morning you ever do the

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:50.639
uh

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.720
the no underwear and basketball shorts

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.800
and you get that graze yeah that

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.800
slippery graze goes across like that's

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.560
gonna make you fill up nice you can have

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.480
a nice heavy hang you're gonna be thick

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.839
you're gonna be thick when you're soft

00:35:01.839 --> 00:35:03.440
thick with thick ones soft which is a

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.960
big deal great side effect for this

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.320
thing and then

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.760
soft is actually i never thought about

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.200
that but yeah thick one saw straight on

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.640
stage for like 40.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.320
that's if i had a genie it wouldn't be

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.920
for a bigger hard dick my heart dick's

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.560
fine i'd want a real shower i want a

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.240
show yeah he's like are you sure you

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.079
cannot hold world peace

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:23.359
unlimited resources

00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:25.839
i want to be so soft

00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:27.440
genie that's what it's a good album

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.280
that's a line on stage that i'm stealing

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.520
from you yeah no but soft needs to be

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.960
it's absolutely common

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.200
that's a big thing that's what you want

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.280
yeah you want to show i want to be able

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.240
to not

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.720
the i the concept of showering at a gym

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.599
is mind-boggling to me i never had

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:45.680
enough i might have like

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.079
kept in my own lane though yes if i had

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.200
to do i think i'd do it because they

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.079
shut our water off uh once this place

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:54.560
and uh to change out the boilers or

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.560
something and i went over to the crunch

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.640
took a shower and i hated it i mean i

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.320
was like towel right to the shower just

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.839
the whole thing that's weird i played i

00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:03.599
played football and you had to go you

00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:05.839
had to go i just went right away just

00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:07.440
went right with i was let me ask you a

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.240
question

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.000
did you do you have a smile

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.720
uh yeah chillin yeah so especially post

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.960
practice i wonder if men with big dicks

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.720
judge guys with small dicks or are they

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.400
like the way same way like mma fighters

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.359
they don't really they don't have to

00:36:19.359 --> 00:36:20.480
fight dudes that don't have a fight

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.920
because they're so above it i think it's

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.280
a sympathy i think they're i think they

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.280
look like oh that must suck

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.640
yeah that's how i feel when i see

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.720
somebody with a small microphone no my

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.560
dick is brutal you know what it's not

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.079
even a microwave you don't know just

00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:33.440
because someone doesn't show well

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.880
doesn't mean that they're not right you

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.960
know

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.720
i feel like my dick is not big at all i

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.240
feel like my dick is pathetic i

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.320
genuinely feel like i have a pathetic

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.800
size dick because my frame of reference

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.320
no you know better that you probably

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.079
don't you just no no i don't i don't you

00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:51.440
only know by like here's the thing i

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.640
don't believe that

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.079
no woman's ever complained about my dick

00:36:54.079 --> 00:36:56.000
size ever it's rare that i've ever had a

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.440
girl even that hates me that go yeah you

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.119
little dick [ __ ] either i

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:00.400
thought they would that would be the

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.839
go-to me too

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:03.839
i've had girls uh they've gone to fat

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:06.160
for sure for sure and not one is ever

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.640
gone so like you little to ever yeah so

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.079
i feel like it's probably i think the

00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:11.359
problem is

00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:12.880
most women have probably experienced

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.040
actual little dicks oh yeah and an

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.640
actual little dick i think is like

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.839
that's christine's work christine goes

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:19.440
there's dicks out there that you can't

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.359
[ __ ] like they don't feel good alex

00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:22.720
what's the smallest dick you've ever

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.160
[ __ ] with and give us some insight

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.720
here because i feel like

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.560
the guy who i lost my virginity to had a

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.560
really tiny dick it was like

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.440
i feel like it was like four inches hard

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.119
that's pretty small that's a that's a

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:37.440
small one

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.200
come on guys what are you talking about

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.880
what about the guy is this the thing is

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.920
this the thing i don't know but what

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.680
about the guy that like is like four or

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.079
five inches soft but then when he gets

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:50.720
hard it just gets harder not bigger

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.160
i've seen that happen in porn a bunch

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.160
that can't is that but i think those

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.560
guys are are using viagra and they have

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.160
that soft hang thing that you're talking

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.880
about or a thick one software oh no i

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.480
think there's guys in the world who just

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.920
always when they pull their [ __ ] out

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.280

i've had no problems with it can i ask

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:28.800
one more question about it

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.839
have you taken regular uh like cialis

00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:33.680

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.480
comparing it to that okay have you i

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.400
have taken a regular viagra in my life

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.400
yes it's the same and it

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.520
seems that what you're describing i just

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.800
know this was different

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.640
same active ingredient um i think this

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.560
is a pretty high dose

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.800
i have they gave me

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.920
i hope they're not listening but they

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.240
gave me an accidentally gave me an extra

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.520
prescription

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.480
so they hooked me up with the

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.240
prescription i chose the highest thing

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.319
you can get which is 28 in a month so

00:40:58.319 --> 00:40:59.200
that means you're like [ __ ] like

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.520
crazy but i get twice that so i get

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.800

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.160
sweet and just take seven of them and

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.240
[ __ ] not really selling the taste of

these things

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.640

juice it's so bad i don't like i'm

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.160
actually craving it because i think it's

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.720
going to be delicious

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.319
it tastes like a shitty candy like if

00:41:34.319 --> 00:41:36.079
you were to get candies out of a 25 cent

00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:37.760
machine like those you know just and

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.280
then no if you were to get candy over 25

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.599
cent machine and then a person swallowed

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:44.079
that candy hole and then [ __ ] it out

00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:45.599
yeah and then packaged it doesn't taste

00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:49.119

i actually haven't tried one yet i'm

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.880
kind of nervous about it why why

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.079

00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:56.160

[Laughter]

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.359

there's not enough room in your

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.680
apartment for you and your boner isn't

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.359
that big bobby's also got to think peace

00:42:15.359 --> 00:42:17.119
too i bet bobby's going i bet if you got

00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:18.880
a big old [ __ ] i i would get rock hard

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.560
if i had a big dick i would get rock

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.119
hard every time i'm the [ __ ] man

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:24.079
well i've always heard that's the

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:26.400
problem uh with big huge black dicks is

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.839
they have a hard time keeping them hard

00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:30.720
because they're big what do you mean

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.040
bandwidth

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.200
they have to upgrade the [ __ ] files

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.560
yeah dude middle of the day the whole

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.400

girls i know who've complained who had

00:42:39.839 --> 00:42:41.680
complaints about [ __ ] black guys it's

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.040
it's that it's like they have a thought

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.440
it was the same heart and then the smell

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.359
and then the lotion everywhere

00:42:47.359 --> 00:42:49.040

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.240
what a waste of fake titles when i got

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.839
them i used to have sex when i first got

00:50:55.839 --> 00:50:57.839
them maybe if i had them redone

00:50:57.839 --> 00:50:59.599
what size were your titties before i was

00:50:59.599 --> 00:51:01.119
like a double she was flat and she got

00:51:01.119 --> 00:51:02.960
big shoulders too

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.720
yeah they were real gross interesting

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.079

00:51:06.079 --> 00:51:07.520
you want a [ __ ] big shot i wouldn't

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.599
guess you had fake titties and christine

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:11.359
said she doesn't want to get fake now

00:51:11.359 --> 00:51:13.200
because she's because her titties are

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.440
small now that stretching them out is

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.880
going to make them look like the two

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.720
balloons kind of thing i don't think so

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.119
proof is shannon yes that happens no i

00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:22.319
thought you i didn't even know shannon

00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:24.319
had fake titties why i didn't either you

00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:25.839

00:51:25.839 --> 00:51:27.520
someone know that i don't know why would

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.480
we know they're big bulbous fake titties

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.040
she's got that face and her personality

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.800
i don't know shannon's whole thing would

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.000
look she just came with natural big

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.520
titties didn't seem weird to me yeah i

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.720

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.040
yeah but they i mean they look fake do

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.480

00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:51.599
much as i do but me personally i looked

00:51:51.599 --> 00:51:52.800
at you i was like

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.800
i'm not i'm not necessarily

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.800
like the [ __ ] terminator so yeah i

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.800
just thought you were voluptuous uh

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.559
pretty woman and uh

00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:01.599
i mean

00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:03.520
so wait let me ask you a question such a

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.640
nice guy

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.400
where's your scars nips

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.720
i don't have any scars no scars no the

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.559
incision was the bottom half of the

00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:13.200
nipple but i don't i have zero

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.440
is that because you just is it is a roll

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.960
of dice and you just healed well or is

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.800
it like i think usually when the

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.559
incision is made there that it heals

00:52:20.559 --> 00:52:22.000
pretty quickly after three weeks i

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.520
didn't have any scar nothing there does

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.440
it feel like silicone and something else

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.680
i have saline because at the time um say

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.520
uh silicone was illegal but they made it

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.839
legal again so what the difference is i

00:52:31.839 --> 00:52:34.240
think silicone feels better they say it

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.960
gets a silicone can get hard though yeah

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.880
they have ones my friend has a gummy

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.319
bear implants those are supposed to be

00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:42.160
like mushier that's jay's favorite type

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:45.160
of

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:51.680
[Laughter]

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.880
i've never had anyone say that they feel

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.160
fake

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.680

real last podcast we we we've been

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.240

much as i thought i wouldn't i got to do

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.400
that the same thing could apply to

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.280
anything

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.480

just reading your reviews yeah that's it

00:54:20.319 --> 00:54:22.079

doctor that had that did these happen to

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.599
like work on park avenue i feel like

00:54:25.599 --> 00:54:27.440
that's a good if you go to costa rica

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.640
you could probably get it done for 100

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:29.440
bucks

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.280

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.240
that way

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.760
what are they too hard

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.200

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.200

getting there with every like you don't

00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:39.440

you want to film the surgery i have an

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.119
idea what is that i'm just trying to

00:57:45.119 --> 00:57:46.640
find a middle ground here what if you

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.720
did a plaster of them and then people

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.640
got to see the plaster

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:54.960
maybe what if they got guys guys better

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.520
my butthole right now i would give it

00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.960
out to fans that they could all [ __ ] it

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.720
regularly for no reason but you also

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:11.599
don't care if you get raped though

00:58:11.599 --> 00:58:13.359
no you've said it before no part of your

00:58:13.359 --> 00:58:14.480
act no

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.319
what i said was if i got raped it just

00:58:16.319 --> 00:58:18.240
wouldn't be that big of a deal

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.720
i would care idiot it just wouldn't it

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.880
wouldn't it wouldn't ruin my life like i

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.559
would [ __ ] get over it we would we

00:58:24.559 --> 00:58:26.079
would legitimately talk about it on the

00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:28.160
podcast two weeks later and it would be

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.839
a bit

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:32.319
i'm wrong i'm stupid you are

00:58:32.319 --> 00:58:33.520
dumb girl

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.119
first smart thing you've said all year

00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:36.480
take a blue chew and let's look at your

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.920
swollen [ __ ]

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:42.640
so i'm fine with doing the plaster cast

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.880
i'm okay with it that was good

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:45.760
because then you could actually have

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:51.640
someone paint it real life-like so then

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.079
you're polluting lewis's mind with your

00:59:00.079 --> 00:59:03.280
pg rated before 10 pm can we plaster my

[Music]

01:03:59.039 --> 01:04:01.119
end of terminator 2 we weren't able to

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.599
stick that's way attached to your body

01:04:05.599 --> 01:04:06.960

don't why are those the tubes that's

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.559
going i swear i we read about it and

01:04:16.559 --> 01:04:18.480
that's what they said they said you ex

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.920
the the fat cells

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.599
just get out of your body that worked

01:04:21.599 --> 01:04:22.720
wouldn't

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.079
everyone know about it like secondhand

01:04:24.079 --> 01:04:26.079
knowledge i think it's pretty new

01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:27.920
everyone uh liposuction legitimately

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.280
works the way it is at home with the ice

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.960
cubes on my body will work like that

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.079
your uh your your body you have my gun

01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:36.079
those ice cubes are nice back on my gun

01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:37.359
every night

01:04:37.359 --> 01:04:39.280
your body won't um

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.880
it won't get rid of fat cells your fat

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.720
cells get engorged and then become

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.640
smaller so this is why like

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.359
this why i i blow up and get smaller

01:04:47.359 --> 01:04:49.520
really quickly and that's the reason so

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.559
what happens is when you take when

01:04:50.559 --> 01:04:52.079
you're doing liposuction removing the

01:04:52.079 --> 01:04:54.079
fat cells from your body this actually

01:04:54.079 --> 01:04:56.480
kills the fat cells so it's it's more

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:57.520
effective the reality is you're not

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.039
going to grow but you can grow back fat

01:04:59.039 --> 01:05:00.319
cells but it's harder to grow than back

01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:01.760
than simply to

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.680
you know [ __ ] them out yeah i'd be

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.920
afraid of an uneven suck

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.480
like when they suck it out they're going

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.079
like that and if they do it i'm too

01:05:10.079 --> 01:05:11.680
embarrassed yeah i'll see you because

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.200
you're willing to go get [ __ ] lipo

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.880
just go run

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.280
no no it's a lot easier it's a lot

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.680
easier but it's i don't know also

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.160
you're not fat i'm you're not fat the

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.079
way that i am though

01:05:24.079 --> 01:05:26.720
you're not fat like

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.319
you know like i can go from like it's

01:05:28.319 --> 01:05:30.799
really uncomfortable to live

01:05:30.799 --> 01:05:32.480
like in the summertime if i don't lose

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.160
weight before the summer kicks in it's a

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.079
it's a miserable life like when it's

01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:37.920
humid hot weather walking upstairs in

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.039
the summer time it [ __ ] sucks

01:05:41.039 --> 01:05:42.880
so much dick so when you say why would

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.160
somebody do it

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.079
if i can go in and then all of a sudden

01:05:46.079 --> 01:05:47.839
i don't have to worry about that it

01:05:47.839 --> 01:05:49.920
becomes easier to maintain the the

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.799
actual

01:05:50.799 --> 01:05:54.240
shame personally ah [ __ ] that all right

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.599
i mean i get the shame it is kind of

01:05:55.599 --> 01:05:57.280
[ __ ] i don't think i'd be advertising

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.599
it if i got it yeah they just show up

01:05:59.599 --> 01:06:01.520
and you're skinny

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.599
you have to advertise it yeah well it'll

01:06:03.599 --> 01:06:05.119
be funny i mean we would advertise it

01:06:05.119 --> 01:06:07.119
because it's hilarious exactly i would

01:06:07.119 --> 01:06:08.559
do it tomorrow

cop pulled up and claimed that evans dog

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.319
was not his

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.239
when evan said he had paperwork for his

01:08:44.239 --> 01:08:47.279
dog the cup asked for his id

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:49.279
and said after he declined the cop tried

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:51.520
to cuff him

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.640
and

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.759
now the screen's off

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.719
but now this is fox news for [ __ ]

01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:01.679
[ __ ]

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.839
it really is now this the

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:06.640
site that's this is like their fox news

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.640
so this these stories are all [ __ ]

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.520
quick

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:13.120
we got sad music playing and [ __ ]

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.120

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.960
no

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.440
it is queen no his name is not queen

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.839
hold on

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.159
all right fast forward to that kind of

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:25.679
long video

01:09:25.679 --> 01:09:29.040
i'm loving it who are you

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.040
this ends with quentin going to jail

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.640
at this point just [ __ ] show your

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.040
ideas not quitting to shut the dude up

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.279
so what that's my that's my dog

01:09:42.159 --> 01:09:44.080
in the house that's insane listen are

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.759
you mark henry the real strongest man

01:09:45.759 --> 01:09:49.839
yes you are don't lie

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.679
he's like no no no

01:09:55.679 --> 01:09:57.840
this five foot three

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.080
black guy is you is younger

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.520
they brought him in and processed him

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.800
they'd release him and he could sue

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.120
maybe

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:07.920
so yeah it ends with the heat they walk

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.360
away they ended up not uh they ended up

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.600
not arresting him

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.040
no no you need to get somebody here

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.080
that's over you because you just made

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.280
the biggest mistake

01:10:26.670 --> 01:10:29.280
[Music]

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.960
the police department told them what

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.560
they're investigating the incident what

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.320
is their side of it

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.679
i mean

01:10:35.679 --> 01:10:37.440
this is just a

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:41.360
a failed impractical joker's bit

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.719
really [ __ ] up

01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:43.920
production didn't get ahead of it

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.480
pushing the envelope and uh

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.320
that is uh i don't know why cops feel

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.880
like that's gonna just making up things

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.239
yeah well no that would happen was the

01:10:52.239 --> 01:10:53.040
cop

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.719
here's what happened the cop drives by

01:10:54.719 --> 01:10:56.080
sees the guy

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.280
and then

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.960
um i guess the guy didn't have his dog

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.159
on his leash and cops they they have a

01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:03.120
they have this thing where they're like

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.480
oh i can just sort of [ __ ] make up

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.000
the rules as i go on so when he

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.360
was sort of [ __ ] with the guy and i

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.719
was like let me see your id which just

01:11:10.719 --> 01:11:12.400
sort of has their process let me see

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.239
your id the guy gave him pushback and

01:11:14.239 --> 01:11:16.320
giving me his id and then it became a

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.120
thing where i was like well now i'm

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.640
going to arrest you

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.239
but they didn't have any reason to kind

01:11:20.239 --> 01:11:22.000
of get there so you think fabricate

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
louisiana and named quentin was just in

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.520
the [ __ ] family no i think there was

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.520
really a person that but i i think they

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.880
came up with that excuse after they

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.920
started [ __ ] with the guy and then it

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.000
became like a pissing contest and this

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.600
guy wouldn't [ __ ] back down he can't

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.440
be there they're so

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.719
cops

01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:38.480
are so emotional as they're not supposed

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.080
to be yeah they shouldn't be emotional

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.159
about like that like the pissing contest

01:11:42.159 --> 01:11:43.520
of us goes dude

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.199
just do your [ __ ] job and beat it

01:11:45.199 --> 01:11:46.880
yeah well i mean the other thing is like

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.880
if i he says he's got you know a

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.320
daughter and a son

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.080
i would say this though

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.679
like

01:11:53.679 --> 01:11:55.360
cops forget anything else i'm saying

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.560
like

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.480
i have when i'm with my son i try to

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.560
avoid conflict by any means you know

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.920
what i'm saying so i almost go as like

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.159
well the cop asks for your id

01:12:04.159 --> 01:12:06.800
it sucks it sucks i just give it to him

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.480
just give it to him just be saying why

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.840
because i'm like why what's the problem

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.600
i would maybe still be you know i would

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.600
still follow whatever it is but i feel

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.760
like you are

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.600
what's the point of some kind of just

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.960
drawing that line and saying i'm not

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.199
giving you the idea i've got also his

01:12:21.199 --> 01:12:22.400
daily experience

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.640
and and and people that that you know he

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.080
knows and stuff like it's something

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.360
right but he's emotionally connected

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.640
i want puerto rican and i've dealt with

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.840
that a lot i've had cops come up and

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.679
leave every time for that reason every

01:12:37.679 --> 01:12:39.520
time you fly and they grab your bag and

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.040

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.480

[ __ ] crazy like i know that it sucks

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.640
and i know but i'm still going like

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.400
you're sort of just [ __ ] do this so i

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:55.040

if there's all because most but they are

01:13:04.159 --> 01:13:05.600
expecting most people to kind of be

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.360
drones which i kind of fall into myself

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.640

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.880

01:13:22.719 --> 01:13:24.320
i take my

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.159
laptop out of the bag even though they

01:13:26.159 --> 01:13:28.080
say you don't have to because sometimes

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.520
they tell me i do have you know i mean i

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.800
just take it out so it's i don't feel

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.640
like dealing with it yeah and it's like

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.760
but there is the thing but this guy's

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.280
right if everybody pushed back things

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.120
might change but like

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.640
how can you where it could go though if

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.840
you're with your kid like in my mind

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.360
you're a big [ __ ] black dude with

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.360
these racist cops who are profiling you

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.880
just for being you know being a black

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.719
you can't wait to tease you i mean dude

01:13:46.719 --> 01:13:48.640
you're you're sort of in front of your

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.080
kids you're number one i don't think

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.280
that's the right lesson to teach your

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.320
kids which is like just not i don't know

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.360
exactly

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.040
lesson i don't know i don't think it's

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.760
about being compliant i think it's about

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.360
you know the conversation with kid is

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.800
like yeah that cop [ __ ] sucks and

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.400
it's unfortunate that we have to live in

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.760
a world where you're going to be

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.120
profiled

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.719
never stand up for yourself son no but

01:14:08.719 --> 01:14:10.000
it's not to stand up for yourself in

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.520
spite of what so then you're being

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.360
[ __ ] arrested in front of your kids

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.960
you're you're possibly being hurt you're

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.040
possibly being tased to make a point you

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.480
know i make a lot of arguments that uh

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.640
female cops are worthless

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.159
uh in their job

01:14:22.159 --> 01:14:24.719
but maybe it should only be female cops

01:14:24.719 --> 01:14:26.000
because there would have to be some

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.920
sense of like reasoning before it goes

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.159
to because it it goes up this reminds me

01:14:30.159 --> 01:14:31.679
of i watched the cops the other day

01:14:31.679 --> 01:14:33.040
where the girl goes up to a guy they

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.719
said this guy was beating on his dog

01:14:34.719 --> 01:14:36.239
which she probably was

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:37.520
but she goes over to him he's not doing

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.120
anything he's just sitting on his porch

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.040
with the dog and she's like asking him

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.719
should i see your id please at his house

01:14:42.719 --> 01:14:45.040
he's like i don't want to give you my id

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.159
and she's like well i need to see your

01:14:46.159 --> 01:14:48.159
id he's like why she goes just an

01:14:48.159 --> 01:14:49.920
investigation he's like an investigation

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.520
into what she goes just give me your id

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.640
and then when she starts going just

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.320
reaching for his arm

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.480
it's like mercifully after three minutes

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:58.239
of this guy making her like a buffoon

01:14:58.239 --> 01:15:00.400
dragging her around the house

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.199
finally the cops when the guy cops come

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:05.120
she's in the way completely of what's

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.120
happening like if she the guy ends up

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.960
getting tased several times and maced

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.239
and it's all because she wouldn't get

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:11.920
out of the way once the dude cops got

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.000
there like she's just imposing herself

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.840
so much the guys can't get position on

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:18.000
this dude at all it's [ __ ] bonkers

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.040
but

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.159
the thing is

01:15:20.159 --> 01:15:22.000
but maybe like having people who

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.640
physically can't uh

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:25.679
those guys go in and they're just

01:15:25.679 --> 01:15:28.239
grabbing wrists right away

01:15:28.239 --> 01:15:29.840
that's a weird thing right now

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.679
guns come out because it's quicker i'm

01:15:31.679 --> 01:15:33.120
sure yeah because it's like if you're

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.280
the i think the rule is like if you're

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.679
at risk you're allowed constantly at

01:15:37.679 --> 01:15:39.040
risk but if they're at risk they're a

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.800
risk by questioning a jaywalker they

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.400
really are it's like that guy can [ __ ]

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.120
you up right now yeah um

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.440
i i'm not i'm not of the

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.800
attitude where it's like oh you just

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.040
have to be compliant you're just playing

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.560
there's there's these rules in the world

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.239
whether they're good or bad right you

01:15:54.239 --> 01:15:55.520
know it's like if i walk through the

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:57.040
hood with my son

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.920
and somebody gives me a dirty look

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.840
they shouldn't give me a dirty look i

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.520
have a right to say i'm gonna [ __ ]

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.800
show them why

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:05.520
but

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.360
it's the rule that i'm playing there is

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.600
like oh well i'm with my kid now i don't

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.280
want to put him in harm's way i don't

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.719
want to i don't want to act

01:16:12.719 --> 01:16:14.640
irresponsibly in front of him and i

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.000
think that's not necessarily the best

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.520
thing to do in front of your kid i think

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.640
it's definitely a conversation it

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.840
definitely may be the best thing would

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.360
have been to not walking through the

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.480
hood

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.440
but sometimes you have to walk through

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.400
the hood

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.280
the issue here um is pets

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:27.630

01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:30.320

pop-out yeah it's much better in my

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.280
opinion a lot more interactive than

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.679
black history month yeah

now

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:41.920
um

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:43.440
i like that

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:44.960
there is some music that i like at that

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.120
style but uh i just that was we just

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.320
caught a part of the song that seemed

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.639
like it was uh it's kind of unilateral

01:26:50.639 --> 01:26:52.880
it was going nowhere it sounded like if

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.320
electricity started a band yeah yeah

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.520
someone's trying to fight out of

01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.320
electricity yeah um i wasn't bad though

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.760
i kind of understand what they're going

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.840
for it's like an atari teenage riot-ish

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.679
or i felt morgan like early marilyn

01:27:05.679 --> 01:27:08.320
manson type well yeah it's industrial

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.400
metal but it's like

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.520
yeah it's

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:12.960
that wasn't the best part of the song i

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:13.840
didn't that's what i feel like i've

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.199
never caught a bad part of the song i

01:27:15.199 --> 01:27:16.320
don't think i wouldn't like the band

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.679
would they clearly

01:27:17.679 --> 01:27:19.760
you know that's a creative insult when

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.120
you say that wasn't the best part of the

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.639
song and it's the only part of the song

01:27:22.639 --> 01:27:24.000
we've heard

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.280
i know there has to be a better part

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.960
there must be it's gotta be the end that

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.800
couldn't be the worst part

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.080
um

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.199

maybe they're saying it a different way

01:28:00.639 --> 01:28:02.480
wild skylines

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.719
style lions that's a better band name

01:28:04.719 --> 01:28:06.960
style lions

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.199
all right let's go with uh 20 seconds of

01:28:09.199 --> 01:28:11.159
their song mosh

01:28:11.159 --> 01:28:15.400
pitch from afar

01:28:16.719 --> 01:28:18.719
hypocrisy and then i'm speaking on it we

01:28:18.719 --> 01:28:20.560
leaving liars from the dust and dark

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:22.960
remains straight like charlemagne the

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.840
king bars upon bars i'm hard to contain

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.030
going all the throne

01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:33.380
[Music]

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.500
that's the hot new sound of 2004

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:38.320
[Laughter]

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.400
they did that thing with all their r's

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.199
yeah they do it's like a hard r yeah i

01:28:43.199 --> 01:28:45.120
am yeah

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.120
can i start this sure can i give can i

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:50.000
give you my uh my

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.280
i think

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.840
that angel blade was substantially more

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.560
interesting

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.040
i think i didn't love the wild stallion

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.080
song

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.760
and i didn't love the angel blade song

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.920
that's the aliens think what angel blade

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:07.120
does is more unique styles

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.920
stallions

01:29:10.159 --> 01:29:11.520
i hate their name and i don't want to

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.800
have also that's another contributing

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.719
factor here i don't want to have to say

01:29:14.719 --> 01:29:16.400
their [ __ ] name a lot

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.120
you know um but angel blade was more

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.480
interesting i didn't like either song

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.719
really okay and and but enjoy was

01:29:22.719 --> 01:29:23.920
substantially more interesting and i

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.679
remember sort of liking what angel blade

01:29:25.679 --> 01:29:27.520
did last week a little bit

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.440
and it's unique and i like the unique

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.800
angle here and they sounded together the

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.719
production of the angel blade sounds

01:29:32.719 --> 01:29:34.960
very very together it sounds really good

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:39.280
so my vote is for angel blade uh i'll

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.600
simply second that notion wild stallions

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:42.960
i actually did like the beat of that

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.159
song a lot with the guitar and

01:29:44.159 --> 01:29:45.120
everything

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.560
but uh

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.080
yeah not definitely popped about it

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.920
where angel blade i'm curious to know

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.360
where that song was going because it

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.440
you're bi-curious i'm bi curious to find

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.040
out where i was going i want to find out

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.800
with men and women

01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.040
every song has that effect on you

01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:00.480
i i'll go the other way i'm going to

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.040
give it to the stylionians

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.120
i'm a sucker for rock rap

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.360
but it's just also so been done before i

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.520
mean that exact song

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:10.639
to a rap song but i thought it was a

01:30:10.639 --> 01:30:12.480
cool rock i liked it i did like the wild

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:15.840
style style leones style leones

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.520
but i think uh if i'm looking for

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.360
longevity i'm gonna try salvagano what

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.719
do you think here my friend do you have

01:30:20.719 --> 01:30:22.639
parameters on which you judge like are

01:30:22.639 --> 01:30:24.159
you looking for someone

01:30:24.159 --> 01:30:25.760
some like are you looking for something

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:28.000
specific like if they're innovative but

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.600
they're more fun like it's whatever you

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:31.600
value whatever you value if you were to

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.280
ask me which song i'd rather listen to

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:34.639
based on those samples i'd rather

01:30:34.639 --> 01:30:36.960
continue listening to the rap rock song

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.880
but my hesitation was that i've heard

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.400
stuff like that over and over and over

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.920
where i haven't heard much like that

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.600
yeah so depending on what you guys judge

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:44.800
well your criteria here's the thing

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.480
right it's a competition it's two

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:47.760
thousand dollars to the winner denny's

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.440
gift card a [ __ ] mountain shane

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.840
secret podcast hoodie this is a big

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.080
company of your parameters

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.159
i would say what do you think yeah who

01:30:56.159 --> 01:30:58.400
is the better who's more deserving of

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.880
the the prestigious prize the money the

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.960
cash being the legion of skanks bop bap

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.960
before

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.360
winner

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.080
it's a big deal so you can figure out

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:12.000
the criteria that you have specifically

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.080
and every week we have different guests

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:16.239
so you know there's you know nothing's

01:31:16.239 --> 01:31:18.639
unfair or fair here it's up to you sally

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:20.159
but who do you want to go further in

01:31:20.159 --> 01:31:21.440
this competition who do you think should

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.520
win that two thousand dollars okay so if

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.000
it was my personal taste i like the wild

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.840
stylings more but if i was thinking of

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.360
what what thing i thought was more

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:32.159
innovative i would say angel blade and i

01:31:32.159 --> 01:31:35.040
guess for a competition like this

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.000
uh

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.480
i would say angel blade because i think

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:39.920
that you know we're looking for maybe

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.679
something a little more unique all right

01:31:41.679 --> 01:31:45.840
paul abdul really yeah

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:48.320
schwartz of the wild style and silence

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.679
was a bit pitchy

01:31:49.679 --> 01:31:51.679
so

01:31:51.679 --> 01:31:53.840
uh so your winner on this round is angel

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.600
but they move on but shane didn't vote

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.800
but either way i want to hear what shane

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.280
would have said i mean

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.199
i

01:32:01.199 --> 01:32:03.280
i don't know both of this was

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:05.840
just [ __ ] i would never ever

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:07.199
ever

01:32:07.199 --> 01:32:09.199
uh

01:32:09.199 --> 01:32:12.800
so i mean it's two zeros out of ten

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:14.639
they reminded me of 311 a little bit the

01:32:14.639 --> 01:32:17.679
stallion stylings i'll give it to so

01:32:17.679 --> 01:32:19.840
it's three to one angel blade so they're

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:21.360
advancing anyway i'll get the stallions

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.120
a little [ __ ] love stallions at least

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.600
they lost by one helions you know i

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.120
shouldn't hold their head up i know i if

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.320
i would have gone i would have put it on

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.520
you i didn't realize i would have made

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.199
sure what would you have said if he if

01:32:31.199 --> 01:32:33.600
he if i go before him i would have gone

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.120
while i was saying so he had to he had

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.199
to ruin someone but let's say he chose

01:32:37.199 --> 01:32:38.800
wild stallions what would you have

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.719
chosen right if i had to pick who you

01:32:40.719 --> 01:32:42.719
had to pick

01:32:42.719 --> 01:32:45.679
gun to your head uh

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.400
[ __ ] angel blade i guess [ __ ] it i don't

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.840
know i love it so they would have won

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:51.199
anyone in that i don't know they would

01:32:51.199 --> 01:32:52.320
have won that would have been i just

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.159
picked it i just picked it it is tough

01:32:54.159 --> 01:32:55.920
they're both you got to ruin some dreams

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:58.159

east of eden let's see a picture of the

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:39.119
tyler trio

01:35:39.119 --> 01:35:40.880

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.840
dusty

01:35:49.119 --> 01:35:52.119
talcum

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:01.560
reasons

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:06.069
[Music]

01:36:10.239 --> 01:36:11.840
hmm

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.360
well those are very different sounds

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:16.560
yeah let's start off with shane now

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:17.920
uh

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:19.679
don't disrespect the bands come on these

01:36:19.679 --> 01:36:21.760
people work very hard

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.360
i'm going

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:26.080
i'm going brain medicine

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.199
brain medicine the the string

01:36:29.199 --> 01:36:31.679
yeah yeah like that all right

01:36:31.679 --> 01:36:34.080
all right sally nothing to say

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.159
okay well tyler doritrio is certainly

01:36:36.159 --> 01:36:37.840
the most professional well-produced

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.040
sounding thing we've heard so far that

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.119
sounded like a cut off of a track on the

01:36:41.119 --> 01:36:44.159
radio yeah uh for that reason i'm like

01:36:44.159 --> 01:36:45.440
okay they

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.639
they've got their [ __ ] together they

01:36:46.639 --> 01:36:48.719
sound tighter but

01:36:48.719 --> 01:36:50.080
it could have just been they have the

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.600
benefit of that recording versus the

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:52.960
other people didn't have you know the

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.199
benefit of recording in a good studio or

01:36:55.199 --> 01:36:56.800
something like that but that's all part

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.239
of it if they have a better production

01:36:58.239 --> 01:37:00.080
can i change my vote sure i forgot i

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.400
didn't really like i'm going tyler dory

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.159
changing it

01:37:04.159 --> 01:37:06.560
okay all right there we go

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:07.679
final answer

01:37:07.679 --> 01:37:09.360
that one's final

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:12.400
calendar trio from shane

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.920
why did you flip it

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:14.800
uh

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:17.119
i forgot that i got thrown off by that

01:37:17.119 --> 01:37:19.520
technical difficulty and forgot that i

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:22.159
did not like that first song

01:37:22.159 --> 01:37:23.679
totally forgot i don't care about

01:37:23.679 --> 01:37:24.520
anything we're doing

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.719
[Laughter]

01:37:26.719 --> 01:37:28.719
but the first song was the noise that we

01:37:28.719 --> 01:37:30.480
were hearing yeah i mean i forgot the

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:34.000
first song was bad yeah

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.600
these would be one for that

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.280
shane doesn't like musicians jane would

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.960
have bullied musicians in high school

01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:41.360
he's not gonna be honest it was the bass

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.040
player the stand-up bass or whatever

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.639
that was in that image it made you angry

01:37:46.639 --> 01:37:47.760
zoom in a little bit and they didn't

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.600
even catch that didn't like that guy

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.960
don't like what he's doing

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.719
his beard let's see if lewis and dave

01:37:52.719 --> 01:37:55.280
had a kid and then the tall handsome

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.239
cool guy who i imagine was the vocals

01:37:58.239 --> 01:37:59.679
kind of sucked at singing and i think he

01:37:59.679 --> 01:38:02.719
just hotted his way into it yeah

01:38:02.719 --> 01:38:05.760
and the chick she could uh you know

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:06.880
is it supposed to be mean to these

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.480
people no you can do whatever you'd be

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.280
honest

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:10.719
and i feel like if the chick if she

01:38:10.719 --> 01:38:12.560
really wanted this band to succeed she'd

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.520
probably

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:17.600
put on shades getting some yoga hey what

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:20.320
come on what don't shame let's vote oh

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.400
that i don't agree with lois yeah that's

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.080
mind body experience that's not that's

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.520
not coming from me but and then again

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.199
i'm not retweeting this so it doesn't

01:38:27.199 --> 01:38:28.480
matter

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.679
you can say whatever you want i i know

01:38:29.679 --> 01:38:31.840
that you're not retweeting bad medicine

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.520
is the one that i would choose to listen

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.199
to the other one wasn't my style of

01:38:35.199 --> 01:38:38.000
music um but i was like hoping for more

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.679
and and the clip we got just felt a

01:38:39.679 --> 01:38:41.040
little repetitive i just want to hear

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.600
more of the sound um so brain medicine

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.000
should know that i like their type of

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
music better but i think the submission

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.760
of taladora trio was so professional

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:50.960
that i'd have to choose them it's a

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.840
better better production i i

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.199
i don't want jay do you want to go ahead

01:38:55.199 --> 01:38:56.480
of me on this because i think i'm going

01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:58.000
to surprise some people right now i'm

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.480
going to go brain medicine

01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:01.679
i'm going to bring medicine that's the

01:39:01.679 --> 01:39:04.400
form against that tyler dory trio

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:05.840
good production

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:08.159
uh decent song but again i feel like

01:39:08.159 --> 01:39:09.840
i've heard that like

01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:12.719
echo chamber sound uh yeah it's very

01:39:12.719 --> 01:39:14.080
old-school it's like a commercial it

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.280
sounds like a commercial for a new

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.520
band's album for best buy and they play

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:18.560
their music video in the background

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:20.639
which is very sanitary

01:39:20.639 --> 01:39:22.480
it's raining inside for some reason kind

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:24.239
of music video everyone's wearing the

01:39:24.239 --> 01:39:26.480
same black leather jacket i i'm with you

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:28.239
i feel like

01:39:28.239 --> 01:39:30.560
interesting it was i i i didn't love the

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.880
song by any stretch but

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:34.400
i think they're doing something uh i

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:35.440
think

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.199
it's more unique they do what they're

01:39:37.199 --> 01:39:39.360
doing better i feel like you know what

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:42.080
i'm saying i think uh dime a dozen tyler

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.080
dory trio no offense and i like their

01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.440
image their image was [ __ ] dude which

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:47.600
was cool i think they sound good it's

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.560
just like i i i bet that band already

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.040
has like die hard fans

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.960
that will follow them anywhere disbanded

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.040
they're good it's just

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.040
it didn't it was i hate to keep on going

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.400
with the unique angle because it's not

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:02.320
just about being unique it's a bunch of

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.320
factors but the fact that i've heard

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.639
tyler dory trio trust company they sound

01:40:06.639 --> 01:40:08.239
like just those bands like like those

01:40:08.239 --> 01:40:10.080
90s

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.920
breaking benjamin yeah

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.360
just heard it a lot whereas i haven't

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.199
heard much like brain medicine before

01:40:15.199 --> 01:40:16.960
very unique and they also nailed what

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.800
they did really well

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.960
um yeah for this competition

01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:22.400
i gotta go with brain medicine and this

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.239
comes down to dave smith as the signing

01:40:24.239 --> 01:40:26.000
vote here which is strange you never

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.679
want it to come down to me i know

01:40:27.679 --> 01:40:31.040
nothing about music um but i will this

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.119
is a tough one because i do think see i

01:40:33.119 --> 01:40:34.960
disagree with louis i thought i don't

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:35.840
have the sheet in front of me was it

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:38.320
tyler duo what is it dory trio tyler

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.480
dory trio i think they were better at

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.639
what they do probably they were like a

01:40:42.639 --> 01:40:45.119
tighter band a more well produced band

01:40:45.119 --> 01:40:47.920
but i g i do just think i've just heard

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:50.000
that sound so much and in a competition

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
like this it's cool to have different

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.560
types of music and i kind of i didn't

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.239
love the song but i kind of dug

01:40:56.239 --> 01:40:57.440
something about what they were doing

01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.880
like it made me want to hear more from

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.320
brain medicine so i'm going to go with

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.239
them ladies and gentlemen brain medicine

01:41:02.239 --> 01:41:04.560
goes through

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.719
and pop-up for the uh to what is it

01:41:06.719 --> 01:41:08.239
semifinals i don't know how all this

01:41:08.239 --> 01:41:10.480
works with the final semi-finals

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:13.119
quarterfinals

01:41:13.119 --> 01:41:14.960

01:43:02.719 --> 01:43:04.320
get that one wrong and then jay moore on

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.159
the left

01:43:06.159 --> 01:43:07.360
um

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.520
and this is kojak and their song is two

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:10.800
steps back

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:14.400
things act differently

01:43:14.719 --> 01:43:16.719
man i really really hope they like me

01:43:16.719 --> 01:43:18.719
the rush is so exciting at parties when

01:43:18.719 --> 01:43:21.360
they invite me tag me in your photo

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:23.360
everybody's sliding but the duck face

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:26.159
sticks making lips look more enticing

01:43:26.159 --> 01:43:27.840
who cares if i'm just following the

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:30.719
quote now

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:35.520
i like both of those i liked both of

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:36.800
those bands i'll go first this time

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:39.040
since i did the tie breaker last time i

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:40.719
don't want that type of pressure again i

01:43:40.719 --> 01:43:42.400
like both of those bands a lot that that

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.480
round was my favorite round of both

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:46.320
songs but i'm going with kojak something

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.239
about that song interested me

01:43:48.239 --> 01:43:49.440
yeah

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:52.400
i'll go second bundy in the spins

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:54.239
okay it's a tie

01:43:54.239 --> 01:43:54.960
so

01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.400
bunny the spins reminding me a little

01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.239
bit of like the um

01:43:58.239 --> 01:44:00.880
misfits kind of vibe yeah but i i found

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.199
that i was enjoying the melody of the

01:44:03.199 --> 01:44:05.040
kojak song more and i wanted to listen

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.960
to that more

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:08.560
although i think bundy and the spin

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.080
sound like a more professional band i'm

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.000
gonna buck the system what i did last

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.920
time and go for the music that i that

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:15.840
song that i want to listen to more i'll

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:17.920
go with kojak two for kojak one for

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:20.639
bundy and the spins can i go next please

01:44:20.639 --> 01:44:22.159
uh yeah because i like making it

01:44:22.159 --> 01:44:24.480
interesting um i really meant this to

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.600
the reason i wanted to go next was

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:26.719
because i'd like to make it interesting

01:44:26.719 --> 01:44:27.920
and i'm gonna go with bundy and the

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:30.080
spins i thought kojak was good they were

01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:32.159
really good but i thought the bundy and

01:44:32.159 --> 01:44:34.719
the spins um

01:44:34.719 --> 01:44:36.639
this kind of hit i think that the music

01:44:36.639 --> 01:44:38.719
just kind of hit me hard i picture these

01:44:38.719 --> 01:44:40.159
guys up there just [ __ ] rocking

01:44:40.159 --> 01:44:42.320
they're ugly they don't they they're

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.480
some of the belt was ugly kojak was ugly

01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:45.840
too but they're [ __ ] like they

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.520
weren't ugly like these no they're not a

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:48.960
co-check's not ugly

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:51.119
those guys give [ __ ] bar posters

01:44:51.119 --> 01:44:52.880
i don't think so they get an arcade

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:53.760
maybe

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.080
bar arcade [ __ ] yeah they're not ugly

01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.840
the same way like these guys were fine

01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:59.520
they're normal dudes

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:01.600
uh bundy and the spins they're ugly

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.199
people they're ugly they're actual

01:45:03.199 --> 01:45:05.040
disgusting looking men

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:06.960
and i think that that says a lot about

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:08.719
the call look at the guys the best guy

01:45:08.719 --> 01:45:10.960
is cross-eyed it's his band picture

01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:13.040
smoothed his hair out

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:15.679
they're blue

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:19.119
you're turning it over to me for the

01:45:19.119 --> 01:45:21.440
decision so i'm just saying i i i think

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:23.360
the the the song just kicked a little

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:25.760
bit harder very very close round liked

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:27.520
both them annoyed that we're gonna have

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:29.040
to see one of these guys go because i

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:30.320
think that they're two of the best we've

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:32.239
had so far in the competition but yeah i

01:45:32.239 --> 01:45:34.000
like bundy and the spins more it comes

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.320
down to jay's vote yeah they were both i

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.159
did enjoy both of those and while i

01:45:40.159 --> 01:45:41.600
particularly in the moment when the

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:44.800
kojak song cut off that i kind of wanted

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:46.560
to hear where it was going

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:48.480
i think ultimately i

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:50.320
enjoyed the music of bundy and the spins

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.719
better holy [ __ ] too so bundy and the

01:45:52.719 --> 01:45:55.600
spin yeah punk rock just [ __ ] good

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.960
it's got to come back every once in a

01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:58.400
while and this is the competition that

01:45:58.400 --> 01:45:59.679
we're going to finally make punk rock

01:45:59.679 --> 01:46:02.000
cool again so bunny in the spins moves

[Music]

01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:58.239
a drunken dad always mad don't take a

01:47:58.239 --> 01:48:01.520
doctor to tell your saddles a lonely

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:04.400
night by the telephone yeah you push

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:07.440

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:08.400
okay

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:10.320
i i'll go first on that and just say

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.520
that's just

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:13.119
feels like one of the most talented

01:48:13.119 --> 01:48:15.199
people we've heard so far in this thing

01:48:15.199 --> 01:48:16.800
just what they were doing i think they

01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:18.080
know how to play their instruments

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:20.400
really well i think they are older guys

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:22.159
and probably just like uh it was pretty

01:48:22.159 --> 01:48:23.760
funny that the first lyrics were a

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:25.679
drunken dad yeah i look like that

01:48:25.679 --> 01:48:27.360
they're writing from the heart i uh i

01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.679
like those guys i'm gonna go south fork

01:48:29.679 --> 01:48:32.239
yeah that i mean

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:40.560
this happens like every year sometimes

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.840
just by the nature of how we do this

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:43.280
composition sometimes you just catch a

01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:45.040
little chunk where you're like ah that

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:46.639
that just wasn't probably the part of

01:48:46.639 --> 01:48:48.639
the song that popped it was like a weird

01:48:48.639 --> 01:48:50.239
thing they were doing but uh yeah i

01:48:50.239 --> 01:48:51.920
agree with jay i thought that song was

01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:53.760
great

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.520
uh yeah i agree i mean i thought it was

01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.280
also you know

01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:59.600
different had a little bit of soul

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.920
i love when bla i like when white people

01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:04.880
culturally appropriate the blues yeah so

01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:07.600
it's just sort of had that feel of uh

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:09.920
you know just taking over getting [ __ ]

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:11.040
done

01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:12.639
um so yeah

01:49:12.639 --> 01:49:14.480
they do move through any feedback from

01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:16.480
the uh the other guests here today would

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:17.760
you guys think of the bands what do you

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:20.000
think about white people appropriating

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.360
i like it um freaky freak boys i

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.679
i really i'm interested to see what they

01:49:25.679 --> 01:49:27.040
actually sound like in the rest of the

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:29.760
song is they sounded extremely unique

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:31.199
but i don't think it was a good enough

01:49:31.199 --> 01:49:34.000
litmus test to give him a win so

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.080
okay yeah i would go with the old dude

01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:37.520
singing yeah it sounded like the clip

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:39.520
was from like a part of the rap where it

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:41.119
was just

01:49:41.119 --> 01:49:43.520
like a [ __ ] interlude not good yeah

01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:44.960
which kind of unless that's their whole

01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:46.320
[ __ ] sound in which case they do

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.440
stink they have a whole album of

01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:49.679
interludes yeah

01:49:49.679 --> 01:49:50.880
i think you guys are a little high on

01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:52.800
south fork i think that kind of yeah i

01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:54.320
think that's stunk a little

01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:56.239
oh really think so that's pretty good

01:49:56.239 --> 01:49:58.239
slightly corny i think they're a corny

01:49:58.239 --> 01:50:00.080

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:02.639

01:52:44.239 --> 01:52:46.239
feel like james halton and bad luck had

01:52:46.239 --> 01:52:48.159
to do more

01:52:48.159 --> 01:52:49.599
that round

01:52:49.599 --> 01:52:51.920

01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:06.960
wanna hear a white power channel it was

01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:09.040
a repetitive beat i feel like and it

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.960
just kept on going and there wasn't

01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:12.159
anything in that part of its own they

01:53:12.159 --> 01:53:13.520
made me go like oh [ __ ] this is some

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:14.800
crazy flow

01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.400
um and dusty tucker i think they did

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.159
enough it was unique it was good it was

01:53:18.159 --> 01:53:19.679
also once again different from the other

01:53:19.679 --> 01:53:21.440
stuff we've heard in the competition and

01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:24.000
finally we got some sort of emotion out

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.320
of shane gillis for one band it's been

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.480

is for dusty tucker i will say bonus

01:53:32.239 --> 01:53:34.639
points for halton and uh bad luck for

01:53:34.639 --> 01:53:36.800
actually having a black rapper

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:38.320
yeah you know that instantly gives them

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:39.599
some credibility because this is the

01:53:39.599 --> 01:53:41.360
battle that was actually why i i held

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.199
that against them oh really see i think

01:53:43.199 --> 01:53:45.199
that helps them but i i like

01:53:45.199 --> 01:53:46.639
both of them are good but i like dusty

01:53:46.639 --> 01:53:48.080

01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:14.159
instruments together with those tiny

01:58:14.159 --> 01:58:16.239
hands big big man instruments they

01:58:16.239 --> 01:58:17.679
should be [ __ ] committed the fact

01:58:17.679 --> 01:58:19.199
that three women can get together and

01:58:19.199 --> 01:58:20.480
not synchronize their periods

01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.719
immediately and get anything done you

01:58:22.719 --> 01:58:24.159
all deserve medals for not getting

01:58:24.159 --> 01:58:27.760
pregnant during the recording sessions

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.440
every instinct they have is to start

01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:31.119
cooking eggs

01:58:31.119 --> 01:58:32.480
instead of playing their instruments

01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:33.599

01:58:33.599 --> 01:58:35.040
shoes in those swollen feet to even get

01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:36.639

01:58:54.239 --> 01:58:56.000
it just getting together and writing a

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.920

biggest competition in the world two

02:00:29.119 --> 02:00:30.800

02:00:33.119 --> 02:00:34.560
every photo that we've had all day guys

02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:37.599

02:00:46.159 --> 02:00:48.400
filter i almost want to discount this

02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:49.760
chick for [ __ ] this shitty photo i

02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:51.199
think that's a dude i think it's a

02:00:51.199 --> 02:00:52.960
[ __ ] lesbian look i got the same

02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:55.520
exact face i understand it's a dude

02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:57.520
and the song is self-reliance if it's a

02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:59.040
guy or if it's a girl i wouldn't be

02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:01.520
offended if i was them because it is

02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:02.960
kind of just

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:04.880
it's it's not offensive it is a little

02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:06.960
tough to tell right i mean just by the

02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:09.280
position of their faces whatever it is

02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:10.560
it's gross

02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:14.639

02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:20.400
[Music]

02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:23.800
probably a dude

02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:30.489
[Music]

02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:32.560

02:01:34.719 --> 02:01:36.000
is it just one dude i mean i want to

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.679
read the bio but it sounds like it's

02:01:37.679 --> 02:01:41.280
just a a dude played both yeah wow okay

02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:42.320

02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.239
give him credit it's like a little

02:01:44.239 --> 02:01:45.199
that's we can't take that in

02:01:45.199 --> 02:01:47.040
consideration this round right

02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:48.639
what you can't take anything from the

02:01:48.639 --> 02:01:51.360
bio that you read but the pictures

02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:53.520
clearly one guy uh and the next song is

02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:56.080
fuzzy coleman and the song is

02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:59.440
let's see the picture first i'm sorry

02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:03.199
it took me a minute to know it was a

02:02:03.199 --> 02:02:05.199
joke which i like maybe it's not maybe

02:02:05.199 --> 02:02:07.840
if it's not a joke even better

02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.199

02:02:11.199 --> 02:02:12.400

look at his [ __ ] eyeballs

02:02:14.239 --> 02:02:16.000
all the way on the left looks confused

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
this is this is a joke right that's a

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.920
joke photo maybe i don't know and the

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:22.240
song is called squeeze cheese

02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:40.189
[Music]

02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:43.280
um

02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:45.360
a lyric-free round

02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:47.520
yeah here i'll go first on this one this

02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:49.360

02:02:52.239 --> 02:02:54.480
you hate putting me down i hate pudding

02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:56.159
it's the one kid doing it that does make

02:02:56.159 --> 02:02:57.840
a difference to me in that i think what

02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:00.639
i heard from that one person making all

02:03:00.639 --> 02:03:01.679
that music

02:03:01.679 --> 02:03:03.760
i would push through

02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:05.520
first and the fast should be late

02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:09.360

02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:10.800

02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:13.360
of the fashionably late can we uh can we

02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:15.280

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:16.960
for when jay speaks or something just

02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:18.800

himself a band

02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:35.760

02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:16.079
of the fashionably late i didn't care if

02:04:16.079 --> 02:04:17.760
it was one person or two pers or two

02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:19.920
people i just like that yeah i like the

02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:21.679
fact it's a young kid he's got a shitty

02:04:21.679 --> 02:04:22.960
photo i hate the fact that his photos

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:24.800
stinks like that out of his two thousand

02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:27.440
dollars he should also get some photos i

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:28.719
was thinking fuzzy coleman's i thought

02:04:28.719 --> 02:04:31.760
their recording was kind of bad

02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:32.960
i thought i

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:35.440
i don't like jam band [ __ ] i don't like

02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:37.360
like i hate that genre so you got to be

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:38.960
[ __ ] you better it's almost like with

02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:41.360
the the hip-hop thing on a similar note

02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:42.800
what i heard of them they weren't

02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:45.119
nailing their jam band crazy [ __ ] so if

02:04:45.119 --> 02:04:46.639
you're just going with playing music and

02:04:46.639 --> 02:04:48.320
[ __ ] playing guitar you better be

02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:50.000
doing some insane [ __ ] where i'm going

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.320
like oh my god who can do that i have

02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:53.920
friends who can play better than that

02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:55.840
you know and i feel like that wasn't

02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:57.119
maybe it's a part of the song whatever

02:04:57.119 --> 02:04:58.880
it was it just wasn't great

02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:01.360
this kid is a [ __ ] young kid he's

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:03.520
playing everything you know pretty in a

02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:05.280
pretty badass way

02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:07.280
um and i sort of root for that guy it's

02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:08.960
sort of an underdog it sounded tighter

02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:10.400
sounded better i liked that style of

02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:12.560
music more so it was a pretty easy

02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:14.239
decision for me it sounded like

02:05:14.239 --> 02:05:16.079
background music for like red alert you

02:05:16.079 --> 02:05:18.320
ever played that no man and conquer no

02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:20.159
no yeah well that's what exactly what it

02:05:20.159 --> 02:05:22.480
sounded like you know fuzzy coleman

02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:24.560
those comments how many votes is what

02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:26.000
who's voting for what now what happened

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:29.119
here i think he won first of all

02:05:29.119 --> 02:05:31.199

02:05:31.199 --> 02:05:33.440

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:36.719
would be late first

02:05:36.719 --> 02:05:39.199
so it's three three to one

02:05:39.199 --> 02:05:40.560
well sal what would you have said i

02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:42.560

02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:26.079
into consideration dude this is first

02:06:26.079 --> 02:06:28.480
impression yeah i say all right at the

02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:31.119
very least he has packaged himself in a

02:06:31.119 --> 02:06:32.639
way where i'm going i would want to

02:06:32.639 --> 02:06:34.000
click on this

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.920
if it was just something to show up i

02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:39.599
appreciate what that is right there

02:06:39.599 --> 02:06:40.880
i think he just said a lot of words and

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:42.880
said nothing at all

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:44.560
too bad it's not a photo i appreciate

02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:47.199
what that is no you know i i just feel

02:06:47.199 --> 02:06:49.520
like that's packaged it is it is good it

02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:50.639
looks especially funny it looks there's

02:06:50.639 --> 02:06:52.079
an aesthetic and you hope that the

02:06:52.079 --> 02:06:53.840
aesthetic is yes

02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:55.119
on that he's got to look people are

02:06:55.119 --> 02:06:56.800
going for shattering of the sound i

02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:58.000
would look at that and be like what the

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.760
[ __ ] is this on for if that pops up i

02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:02.079
don't think my computer has a virus yeah

02:07:02.079 --> 02:07:03.840
it's got great lip jewelry what do you

02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:05.280
think the sound's gonna be based on the

02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:07.520
photo and the graphic um

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:10.880
wow things are hard yeah

02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:13.840
pretty much that

02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:16.239
it's so dark out

02:07:16.239 --> 02:07:17.599
i mean i'm gonna guess my guess would be

02:07:17.599 --> 02:07:19.280
metal yeah

02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:20.400
yeah probably a little bit of maybe

02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:22.639
electronic metal yeah that's what i

02:07:22.639 --> 02:07:23.679
would do

02:07:23.679 --> 02:07:25.599
i don't remember from last week so we've

02:07:25.599 --> 02:07:27.360
heard his music provides don't remember

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:31.079
the song is called retrograde

02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:50.480
[Music]

02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:51.760

almost nine inch nails e um wasn't that

02:07:57.679 --> 02:07:59.440
exactly what it was it was exactly what

02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:01.280
it was yeah it was just i just imagined

02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:04.719
an ugly chick stripping to that

02:08:05.119 --> 02:08:06.880
if you're imagining it why not imagine a

02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:08.719
hot chick because ugly chicks dance to

02:08:08.719 --> 02:08:11.440
