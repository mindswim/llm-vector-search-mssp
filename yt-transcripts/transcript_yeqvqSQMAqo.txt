that you go see I read dude I read

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.960
literally like five statuses like

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.180

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.340
yourself to get exact dude that movie

00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:21.289
yeah I mean it wasn't [ __ ] they might

00:08:21.289 --> 00:08:23.000
have watched it on TV you know if I was

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.590
here on a Saturday night oughta watch it

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.500
on TV and then I would have said this

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.710
movie [ __ ] sucks yeah dude you got to

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.320
read the the Rotten Tomatoes [ __ ]

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.570
reviews are hilarious what to say uh

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.209
like this one from Matthew Luke onna

00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:43.459
from the San Diego reader he's a top

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:44.100
movie cred

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.650
of course cultural appropriation shifts

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.410
from problematic to horrific in writer

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.360
director Jordan peels sharp take on the

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.840
scary world of stuff white people like

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.030
that's a real review Jesus Christ it

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.910
this is a good one by will leach from

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.220
the New Republic he says get out has its

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.130
surface scares but it's what's lingering

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.020
beneath that's most frightening the

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.730
sense that no matter where you turn no

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.260
matter how many people claim they're on

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.110
your side they're out to get you dude

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.850
I've given you my theory on this before

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.240
right but this is great Amy Amy

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.890
Nicholson these are all white people

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.080
reviews by the way this is Amy Nicholson

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.050
from MTV in most slasher flicks a guy

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.670
like Chris would die first

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.100
peels joke is that the cliche has it

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.900
backwards young black men know their

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.060
lives are in peril from the first frame

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.740
ooh spooky

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.130
that's telling you this is just now

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.560
backing like the early South there was

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.060
like obviously you're you know say

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.200
you're like kind of dumb you just follow

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.880
the trend you join the KKK and that was

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.990
like you didn't put any thought into it

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.260
there same kids now are those same dumb

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.020
brain now is like we hate racism but

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.400
they just don't know how to [ __ ]

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.140
navigate these waters to where they're

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.700
like we'll see that like that was the

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.910
best movie ever saw and it's like why he

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.640
was [ __ ] okay the movie wasn't scary

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.080
there was literally not a scary part

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.170
where scary part I get scared you see a

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.760
movie so if you make a loud noise and

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.470
movie I jump so I don't I'm not a good

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.630
I'm not a good I got I jumped at the

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.310
gallon so that movie was scary

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.960
no wasn't scary at all I was I wasn't

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.550
scared for I just got started a couple

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.470
times the only thing funny about it was

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.630
the his black friend yeah who just used

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:32.880
about as yeah standard he's like I'm the

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.400
[ __ ] TSA dog [ __ ] save Joe

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.980
ass I was pretty clear edits like are

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.870
you kidding that was pretty close black

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.000
people it's like man you better get the

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.840
[ __ ] up out of man everyone like

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.000
yeah pretty pretty cliche the whole

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.850
movie was a bit cliche I mean it was it

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.400
was so it's supposed to be satire and

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.090
like it's so there's no obvious it's not

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.010
there's nothing there was no subtleties

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.470
at all it was a black eye getting

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.000
attacked by white people with lacrosse

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.130
sticks yeah yeah yeah who want his

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.110
strong muscular body yeah

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.730
which tell me that's still technically

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.710
satire it's just uh I know it's not

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.440
satire why it has to be like satire not

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.320
in their Haunter culture that's all that

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.160
was for yeah

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.690
person oh I see what you're saying no

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.460
absolutely it's not yeah there's not

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.830
like a that's not rallying against this

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.830
big pervasive yeah

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.180
that is that's where it becomes its

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.430
satire becomes not just that it was just

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.810
that while that was yeah that was

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.600
propaganda it was [ __ ] that was

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.279
literally propaganda for white [ __ ]

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:39.920
to be like yeah and I never do that it's

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.360
like dude oh my god shitty that sucked

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.570
the evil white people dude yes wild that

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.310
was weird man that was I would literally

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.780
felt weird in there I was watching it I

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.230
was like then it's not like the movie

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.880
itself is oh yeah I'm so we went to a

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.010
black movie theater to watch it yeah we

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.560
were yeah but the movie itself isn't

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.780
shocking it was just like the fact that

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.460
I know so many people who were like you

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.800
gotta see this on Facebook is like and I

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.170
don't barely look at Facebook so like

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.880
there was like five people out of like a

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.320
two second scroll who were like this is

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.100
the best yeah

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.870
so I barely look and I saw that and I

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.490
was and I knew it I was like I know that

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.290
movie sucks I bet it I did not just like

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.060
I have feeling it actually you know what

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.530
I thought it could be decent

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.630
I was like I to be scary exact but I

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.110
knew what from the first time I saw a

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.610
preview for it I was like are they

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.920
really going to make a movie we're

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.450
literally the monster is white people

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.580
well I don't even that [ __ ] crazy

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.790
yeah I mean that wasn't I get I mean I

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.209
don't know

00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:40.850
like your hang-up here I don't think

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.529
that's like that bad or they're making a

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:44.270
movie where white people are the monster

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.880
I don't like yeah if they're making

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.100
white people to monster you because

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.450
that's I mean it's not like like Texas

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.040
Chainsaw Massacre yeah he's a white

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.410
family know that yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.649
these are just white people like

00:12:57.649 --> 00:12:59.930
yes we want the black man yeah that was

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.180
weird that walk important bazaar we want

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.709
to live through your strong bodies and

00:13:03.709 --> 00:13:05.839
eyes and it was like like why black

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:07.399
people is like cuz you're stronger and

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:11.269
faster than us yeah yeah what the [ __ ]

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:13.339
but didn't mean that's the you know ho

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:14.360
black well that was the whole joke

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.360
behind it is a big joke but it's like I

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.709
don't think that's a joke that they're I

00:13:18.709 --> 00:13:20.269
think they believe that the statement

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:23.149
yeah I think Jordan Peele yeah I think

00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:24.740
that's pretty you're allowed to say that

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.009
with complete guarantee I'm gonna be

00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:29.809
like yes black people are faster and

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.429
stronger than white people you're

00:13:31.429 --> 00:13:32.869
allowed to say that and people be like

00:13:32.869 --> 00:13:36.800
yeah yes but no yeah it's weird as weird

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.149
as a weird that movie was very

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:38.990
unsettling

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.339
it's just I'm telling you man it's the

00:13:40.339 --> 00:13:42.920
movement of white [ __ ] in America

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.730
yeah and it's not unsettling it's not

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.319
unsettling for what it tried to be

00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:50.629
unsettling about it's unsettling that

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:52.069
people actually think that this is a

00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:53.509
good movie I'm talking about [ __ ]

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:54.920
crazy that's not exactly the movie

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.300
itself I wasn't like this is really

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.910
outrageous I was like freaked out by how

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.660
much everyone loves it it's weird it's

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.389

00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:07.749
[ __ ] the world of a white [ __ ] dumb

00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:10.550

be causing people on comforted be it

00:17:02.179 --> 00:17:04.069

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.980
secret plots to that movie is that white

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.760

thinking about my own experiences and

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.399
what I might be doing to kind of cause

00:17:16.399 --> 00:17:18.649

appropriating culture that's true I turn

00:25:23.769 --> 00:25:25.630

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:52.539
just saw that movie and thought we were

00:25:52.539 --> 00:25:54.309
out to catch to try to cap I thought

00:25:54.309 --> 00:25:56.830
about the Steeler brains we can ride

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:59.670

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.240
zombies do white people are out oh

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.710
really I wanted to ride I want to pop a

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.480
wheelie on his bicycle so bad I want to

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.990
steal his eyes dude just [ __ ] do that

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:11.220
would be fun though going around all day

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.900
and calling white people's dogs [ __ ]

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.030

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.090

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:28.620
can't slap him he's not that's well I

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.970
think my favorite part in that movie was

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.760
the white kid the white brother like

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.070
knew he used jujitsu yeah that was the

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.530
white hands tricks do you like MMA bro

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.570
he's like white people up that's all we

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:41.400
do we trained you Jitsu yeah

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.030
and we try to steal your brains exactly

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.770
classic white people hey the brother was

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.290
very poorly played that was a really

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.240
shitty AK I thought was [ __ ] Macaulay

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.920
Culkin at first that would have been

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.200
sick but Holly out of it like I as a

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.830

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:01.050
buggy gets double [ __ ] paint buckets

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.640

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.650
and I was ahead [ __ ] movie game on

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.050
oh man I don't know who ever was the one

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:14.880
twist that got me was at the very end

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.460
when the when the cop car pal yeah I was

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.770
like dude or he gets shot by a cop right

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.260

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.850
the worst movie I've ever seen my life I

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.090
just thought maybe arrested

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.620
it surprised me even more by how much

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.810
worse that that ending actually was him

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.670
being like I told you I'm not to go in

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.500

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.820
the end of the movie yeah

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.300

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.970
year people like yeah he's good he's not

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:21.360
racist and then but you know you get a

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.060
year and if you do too much improv you

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.620
gotta watch out if you do too much

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.480
improv that's the trick you might not be

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.860
racist but you'll probably finger a

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.690
chick you get those grabby hands yo

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.340
little grab that you watch out that's

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.540
the thing where you grab you aim and

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.160
that's what they're doing if you have

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.080
the need all the time to be like I'm not

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.240

mating

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.230
well no it's technically raping it well

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.390
not nature but it's got it pretty much

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:47.290
every animal rapes do or they'll be like

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:49.150
it some birds like exotic dances then
