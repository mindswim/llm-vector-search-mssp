00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.069
watching oh yeah dude I mean I thought I

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.849
had sick theories it's not know so you

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:19.110
thought you had sick there yeah I

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.039
thought I had some groundbreaking

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.539
theories this and I don't know why no

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.699
one's ever talked about this guy his

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:25.590
name's Julian Jaynes and his books

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.060
called the origin of consciousness the

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.370
breakdown of the bicameral mind so I'm

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.289
like I just you know I saw the cover and

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:32.759
I'm like I mean that's sounds [ __ ]

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:34.050
cool enough yeah you just want to be

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.250
able to say break down the bicameral

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.500
mind exactly so I didn't know it was

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.849
funny too because I had we I did a

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:40.469
patreon sit on I started talking about

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:41.779
the book and I'm on a unicameral

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:44.339
unicameral big-time unicameral mind well

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:45.719
thanks to the corpus callosum yeah you

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:49.580
are unicameral yeah but they're buying

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.319
thank you corpus the I'm starting to

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:53.940
Sydney about this yesterday and I was

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.680
like it's funny if you listen when I put

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.909
up an on patreon and I put it up on

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.710
patreon you'll hear like I bring it up

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.120
and realize that I have no idea what the

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.490
[ __ ] buy camera line is I'm like yeah

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.719
it's pretty cool like I haven't read

00:08:03.719 --> 00:08:05.430
about it yet but like I'm excited to

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.150
learn but so I research I like went to

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.650
figure out exactly what it is is I'm not

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.870
all the way down the book dude so this

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.279
guy's theory on consciousness and this

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:15.900
is what Sidney said sin he was like you

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.370
know we were going back and forth from

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.520
what I remember and he was I was a kid

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.979
we'll talk yeah we'll talk to the kid

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:25.710
and this is his realm - he loves he

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.779
loves all that [ __ ] but his his old I

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:28.740
was telling him the different theories

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.569
there was like they started as like

00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:32.250
consciousness matter like all matter has

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.959
consciousness be like no no cellular

00:08:33.959 --> 00:08:36.029
organisms have consciously no no animals

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.959
have consciousness like no no

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:38.789
consciousness is learning and I was in

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.260
Sid got stuck on the learning he's like

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.339
well if I learned something that is

00:08:41.339 --> 00:08:43.800
consciousness it's like okay sure what

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.540
he's talking about is meta consciousness

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.880
as consciousness of conscious thought so

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.860
a dog can like you know be trained and

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.240
respond to treats and bells and all this

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:51.690
stuff

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.790
but a dude you can sit down and think

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.680
about your thought process and that is

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.629
what when people say like modern

00:08:57.629 --> 00:08:58.680
consciousness that's what we were

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.980
talking about now his theory is the the

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.250
bicameral mind which was back

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.110
like when we before we like organized

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.410
into like larger groups of people his

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.970
theory is that you know we the left and

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.050
right hemisphere and they weren't

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.290
connected yet so like like the we were

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.699
organized just like any other primate

00:09:17.699 --> 00:09:19.500
where there'd be like a dominant person

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.959
up top pretty much dude and he'd be like

00:09:21.959 --> 00:09:24.000
do this [ __ ] do that so they were like

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.470
communicating like you got to do this

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.420
you got to do that and then it would get

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.519
so like that figure would get kind of

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:30.990
stored in your right side of your brain

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.790
but the brain hemispheres didn't

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.959
communicate so you would have an

00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:36.329
auditory hallucination of who was in

00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:37.589
charge and like what they were saying

00:09:37.589 --> 00:09:39.810
and then you'd be like oh [ __ ] I got to

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.370
do that and that's how religion kind of

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.230
evolves yeah that's good yes that was

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.730
like it was based off of people having

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.170
hallucinations he went back you know all

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.120
these like old texts and everything

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.339
basically people for the most part

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:51.720
didn't have any sort of volition by

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.009
their own everything was like a God said

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.050
this God said this follow Allah and they

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.269
said it's like society kind of organized

00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:58.709
and he got bigger and bigger that's what

00:09:58.709 --> 00:10:00.389
happened people would have these

00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:02.009
hallucinations and this is what we're

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:03.120
doing they tease someone else and

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.800
they're like yeah dude turns out this is

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.120
what we you get what we heard we're

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.889
supposed to do because the whole book of

00:10:07.889 --> 00:10:10.709
even the Bible right away gets into like

00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:12.569
and then we got some walls it's like

00:10:12.569 --> 00:10:14.040
some dude hooked us up with walls and

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.870
then you know that was kind of it yeah

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.639
so like there was the idea is that

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:20.639
people were basically hallucinating like

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:22.560
their ruler their kings then it kind of

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.029
got like more and more abstract as time

00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:25.439
went on but that's why they would like

00:10:25.439 --> 00:10:27.420
there was all that confusion between

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.279
like a king is a god and they buried

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:31.230
kings and like worship them as like gods

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.970
because the king would die and their

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.769
voice and orders people to hallucinate

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:36.240
and have auditory hallucinations and

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.709
hear their orders and they started

00:10:37.709 --> 00:10:38.790
following and they built like whole

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.579
societies around that and then he said

00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:43.380
so that's that was the bicameral mind

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.329
was that that like it wasn't connected

00:10:45.329 --> 00:10:46.800
and people were hallucinating like

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.259
religious experiences and he said that

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:50.639
was like an evolutionary feature that

00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:53.430
like allowed us to be to live in larger

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.089
and larger more complex arrangements and

00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:58.500
then eventually that broke down and

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.110
that's now we have modern consciousness

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.430
that once our two brain hemispheres

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.110
started communicating that kind of went

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.520
away but it still he said

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.290
still he exhibits it still manifests

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.300
itself in schizophrenic sand [ __ ] yeah

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.610
but kids afrien extend to have religious

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.410
elucidate like like you loosen nations

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.380
of like religious or like very uh

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.970
commandos yeah we're very commands very

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.940
commanding voices but also how how could

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.550
the brain evolved that quickly it was

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.190
like I think this is important years

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.930
fouls but I think he's talking about

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.850
like the years leading up to that like

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.370
the ancient like this the Mesopotamians

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.440
and all that Sun God all that all that

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.570
stuff so you'd be like looking at the

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:44.430
Sun and you're like oh and that was just

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.260
like that was the way because I and this

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.520
is where I get kind of hazy but it was

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.470
like there was language and then that

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.510
somehow stored itself in the brain and

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.450
then would be kind of just experience to

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.820
like an auditory hallucination to where

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.410
you'd be like oh [ __ ]

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.940
and that's how people that's how society

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.370
kind of organized seems like there's a

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.190
lot of stuff that's well think of it

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.930
this ear refutable because there's no

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.480
it's wild but again I haven't the book

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.950
is like it's this thick so he goes

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.450
through a bunch of stuff and it's it is

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.370
a controversial theory but it's also if

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.860
you think about it there's a king he's

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.450
just like chopping [ __ ] heads

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.640
off so everyone's like totally [ __ ]

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.740
traumatized and [ __ ] up to make some

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.090
point it makes sense that you'd be

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.800
having like [ __ ] hallucinations and

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.900
[ __ ] of this guy who came in like cut

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.220
everyone's head off and he's like in

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.690
you're just like well everyone's a whole

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.430
town's in shock now and people are

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.020
growing out of that of like whoa what

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.450
the [ __ ] happened so kind of a I mean to

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.370
me it's like it's the most interesting

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.140
explanation I've ever heard of for

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.390
consciousness because they don't have it

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.620
the other explanations are just that

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.000
like well it just kind of naturally

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.610
arose from our like brains and it's just

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.490
it's all basically like we're designed

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.820
to you know for a biology we're designed

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.490
to like mate reproduce do other stuff

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.170
and like it's more like consciousness is

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.360
just like steam coming off that whole

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.220
process so if it's a train it's just a

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.050
whistle so all we can really do the

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.250
other theories they're like we're just

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.930
doomed observer so what consciousness is

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.060
just awesome being be like what the [ __ ]

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.410
what the [ __ ] with the book with the

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.620
word yeah I kind of I kind of tend to

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.090
agree with that yeah well you're a

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.560
rugged materialist I've always been a

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.310
very staunch rugged mature

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.500
as well as like everything we do is

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.290
instant pre-programmed yeah so but this

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.120
one is not this one's not too far off

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.680
that it's just the way that our brain

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.480
actually experiences that's another one

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.100
that I think is kind of irrefutable like

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.310
everything we do is instant yeah so

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.170
that's like there's like a guiding hand

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.420
to every single thing we do and the

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.730
reason we're doing it is because you

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.980
know past experience and the reason we

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.980
gained that experience because of

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.960
instead you know yeah like so let's say

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.700
my dad was a [ __ ] to me mm-hmm

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.920
he wasn't yeah of course Phil Gillis you

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.980
guys podcasters people are talking

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.529
people I know I know people were talking

00:13:56.529 --> 00:13:58.000

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.940
feel of bias you can have anymore is

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.220
your sexual preference yes you're

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.450
telling me you're not sexually

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.400
attractive I'm sure I can tell I haven't

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.890
looked at the full roster sure I can go

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:23.970
out on a limb here and say there's

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.550
definitely probably at least two on the

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:30.500
roster that mmm but you know get my look

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.000
look to have sex with a [ __ ] person

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.810
it has to be really weird II I think

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.120
you're allowed to uh I think as long as

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.440
it's 18 I don't think you're I guess it

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.360

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.490
have to ask for their like hand in

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.500
marriage I think they have like a very

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.790
medieval coordinate process I think it's

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.830
a very medieval courtship process like

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.300
both your parents have to be present for

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.470
the day you just walk with your hands

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.470
behind your back

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.880
yeah that's a tough one you're totally

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.350

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.400

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:30.820
Monroe

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.830
started he opened his set because I was

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:33.850
like you got to tell they won't see ya

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.140
he opened with that crowd was not

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.350
excited why I didn't like the people so

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.480
[ __ ] neutral dude and then he brought

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:40.870
that up

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.430
he was like I'm the only I'll do it why

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.680
would you guys not like that was it was

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.450
pretty good he got out of it good hit

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.100
him with the reverse cuz they were upset

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.180
and he was like I'm sorry I'm

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.810
open-minded and I would do that damn I

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.380
still I did I don't know if it's illegal

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.550
it has to be though because they had

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.780
they're like they have like Guardian

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.880
they might have a guardianship well if

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.440
your guardian says it's cool though I'm

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.060
Tony I think they wrote obviously you

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.430
can't legally force them to not be able

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.500
to [ __ ] I'm saying that's I think it's a

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.730
very feudal system

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.980
it's like feudal law you have to get the

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.170
parents the parents have to sign off and

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:15.520
then you're like I'm asking for your

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.360
daughters and you have to give the

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.700
parents a gift preferably livestock and

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.830
then you can get yourself a special

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.230
insight yeah so why any other gifts you

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.350
might well it's all about the parents so

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.820
just some coins wrapped in [ __ ]

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.010
burlap dude you have to go but you have

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:31.120
to literally or you have to be like

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.870
highborn show them your pedigree

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.400
yeah it's a very futile process dude

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.049
that's literally how it works there's no

00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:40.669
way it works any other way then you have

00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:41.900
to go get the parents you're saying they

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.390
have a guardian yeah so you have to be

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.760
like hey I love your daughter she's 17

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.679

00:35:35.269 --> 00:35:37.400
do this is the stuff people need to do

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.690

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:46.940

look me up yeah but yeah the so the idea

00:36:08.869 --> 00:36:11.390
is to take all the things out like that

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:13.130

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:16.759
a word I'm trying to analgesics sorry I

00:36:16.759 --> 00:36:19.460
know analgesics any yeah anything that

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.470
kind of like soothes you or kind of like

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:24.380
you know analgesics yeah never heard

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.130
that one is it eye problem probably

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:29.390
completely got to pronounce he's

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.069
probably mispronouncing it so it's like

00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:33.410
anything that's like soothes you so like

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.839

because I would just consume an entire

00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:12.049

how are you good I feel good it's just

00:40:40.369 --> 00:40:42.020
the whole point of this is you like

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:45.349
shrimp away all of your little like you

00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:47.480
know there I call them like safety

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.340
mechanisms like little come your

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.859
comforts your automatic comforts you

00:40:51.859 --> 00:40:54.619
strip them and then it expose you expose

00:40:54.619 --> 00:40:57.800
the [ __ ] the dweller dude I'm not

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.730
gonna get in the dweller on the

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.050
threshold but it's like what's the

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.300
dweller on the threshold it's just like

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.339
you're it's like the unrealized portion

00:41:04.339 --> 00:41:05.780
of yourself that haunts you at every

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.270
turn so there's there's aspects of your

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:10.010
personality that are constantly bubbling

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:11.510
up and just absolutely [ __ ] wonder

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:12.740
how many people are dealing with it

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.869
everybody I mean this is what everyone

00:41:14.869 --> 00:41:16.609
can say there are - you know there are

00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:17.810
personalities out there that just

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.990
totally ignore how dumb they are sure

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.119
but it that means they're just I mean

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:24.890
they're just [ __ ] automatons they're

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:27.890
completely just passing through so let's

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:29.119
say this is an easy work do there's

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:31.280
tough work so you literally just let

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.630
your whatever it is that you're just

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.240
[ __ ] eating away and it just cut it

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.950
manifest and you go oh man what the [ __ ]

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:38.210
is this and then you take shrooms

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:40.400
well then the idea is you find out what

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.540
you're doing that you think you should

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.099
probably stop mines

00:41:43.099 --> 00:41:46.220
obviously spazzing on Brittany okay just

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.480
like at the drop like E not even

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.030
spazzing but like getting into arguments

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:52.700
and like participating as an angry

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.560
participant I'm like I think I can stop

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.330
doing that yeah so you observe yourself

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.490
and like a stripped raw naked state and

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.440
you're like doing this I'm doing that

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.270
I'm eating [ __ ] banana bread every

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.839
chance I get

00:42:02.839 --> 00:42:04.240

once and just be like the Hulk yeah yeah

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.930
belly would just [ __ ] it Buster your

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:02.290
shirt be getting into so the idea is to

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:03.580
like you write down the things that

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:04.450
you're doing you're like I probably

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.700
stopped and then after a month you start

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.619
the micro dosing so then while your

00:44:08.619 --> 00:44:09.940
micro does and your inhabiting these

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.650
weird little systems that been bothering

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:13.630
you and then you're going to model and

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:15.400
while under the effects of psilocybin

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.530
you model yourself a creative solution

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:17.980
you're

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.600
problem and then you bring that back to

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.950
your everyday social life and you try to

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:24.369
like you know I'm saying yes so it's

00:44:24.369 --> 00:44:27.580
like what the [ __ ] are called the

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.800
excited delicately assisted positive

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.340
self leadership it's part of a multi as

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.359

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:10.390
why is it something I'm like I'm a

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.730
tyrant with the television I see the

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.920
house I'm in control I'm an acceptance

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.079
for you or I date I date a control freak

00:48:17.079 --> 00:48:18.910

better no no not at all you just

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:26.260
completely bad you cave worse people to

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.420
watch like YouTube compilations which is

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:29.829
good it for an acceptance freak when I

00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:31.029
see someone take the remote and start

00:48:31.029 --> 00:48:32.740
putting stuff on I'm just like sweet

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.809
yeah thank you that's why we're dogs for

00:48:34.809 --> 00:48:37.029
sure because it's like if I have to like

00:48:37.029 --> 00:48:38.410
if someone's like here pick what to

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:40.660
watch I'm like like I'll start watching

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.400
like origins of the bicameral mind and

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.480
someone's like the [ __ ] is this

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:50.340
I get mad when you tell me that [ __ ] the

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:54.000
[ __ ] off but the yeah it's funny so what

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.740
happens though an acceptance freakin a

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:57.330
lot of them will be like I'm like you

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:58.320
know I just kind of go with the flow

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.360
what happens is you go with the flow and

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.360
you just slowly it's like a constant

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.160
cycle you slowly and hit you slowly

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.860
construct an uninhabitable reality

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.750
through being like okay okay okay and

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:13.250
then finally you're just like trapped

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:18.030
dude it's like that's the constant cycle

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:26.880
any boss that I run into that so you're

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.530
both subconsciously doing this you're

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:29.490
just kind of like all right here's

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.470
what's going down okay cool and then

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:33.900
they'll slowly give up control to the

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.430
point they go like wait a sec a tit what

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:39.120
the [ __ ] going on like where the [ __ ]

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.800
is coming from don't [ __ ] don't act

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.630
like yours like because they're slowly

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:44.460
building this imaginary world against

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:49.050
you they're like he knows they just

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:52.460
explodes I don't want to get pizza again

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.900
yeah but imagine dude from the control

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:55.860
side it's tough

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.870
I can imagine worried about it like is

00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.010
this something everybody wants to

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:00.720
watched is this something I I know if

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.790
there's pressure is true it's easy I

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:04.680
think the acceptance is a lot less like

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.470
it's easier whatever except until so you

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:09.540
get push freak the [ __ ] out yeah push to

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.250
the brink so it was a lot in there the

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:13.860
thing especially in relationships my

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.690
whole history of relationships was as

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:18.540
being a horny disgusting toad cause like

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.950
I'm gonna get some [ __ ] I'm gonna get

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:24.690
some [ __ ] yeah and then I'll date a

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.640
girl and be like oh I gotta put all my

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.580
church clothes in charge like $10 you

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:31.260
disgusting freak it's like it literally

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:32.790
like a CIA agent it is you have to

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:34.860
pretend not to be that toad exactly so I

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.570
didn't after but they then you get in

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:38.370
the relationship in so now you're like

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:40.590
in total [ __ ] like Jason Bourne's

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:41.790
nosy and some warts

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:45.540

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:56.510

before I was a total luster dude so I

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.730
was a luster who would enter into like

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.650
false persona agreements where I would

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:15.620

people view is all about fashion yeah

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.690
the movie is disgusting it's literally

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:29.250
about a lady who doesn't care about

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.810
fashion and then she starts dressing

00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:32.160
properly and like all the good things

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.360
start happening for and it's basically

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.190
being like oh you don't care about

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:37.290
fashion that's why we're picking out

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:38.850
what you're wearing right now and you

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:40.530
don't even know and it's like I also

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:43.500
don't give a [ __ ] so yeah it's it the

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.260
movies so [ __ ] dumb but yes I was

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.150
watching it kind of like the whole thing

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:49.380
relates back to O'Connor talking to

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:50.760
Irish Ari Shaffir Lee we're watching

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.650
this movie me and three girls and I was

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:55.680
just like I said something about like it

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.450
was something similar of like oh look at

00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:59.880
her she has a like some corny like the

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.010
old [ __ ] dude thing and they just

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:03.840
literally all like all three - signor me

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:08.460
dude and I was just like my recliner has

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.940
a loose bolt it was like like i sat

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:15.060
there broiled in shame and I was just

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.530
like I wonder how this works like are

00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:18.090
they all gonna bake what the [ __ ] was

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:19.860
that or like a lot of times you just

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:20.760
ignore that you're someone saying

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.980
something or like in my head it's just

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.050
like they're just like what the [ __ ] is

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:28.110
this guy [ __ ] [ __ ] dude does he

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:29.820
know how to watch devil wears later

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:36.120
after sighs yeah O'Conner literally cuz

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.650
it was one of those things where it

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:39.540
seemed like Ari didn't really hear him

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.310
like it looked like he did because

00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:43.500
obviously Ari would answer sure and like

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.450
be like at least hit him with like oh

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:46.950
yeah sometimes - you're just in your

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.120
head to where like someone says

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.590
something to you I'll do it to where I'm

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:52.020
I just could see cuz O'Connor doesn't

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:53.670
know him so I could see him like working

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:55.650
up the courage to like throw out a I've

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:57.330
done it a million sure you say something

00:54:57.330 --> 00:54:59.460
it's like you're just you're just you're

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.140
trying to want you're one of the guys in

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.730
yeah I tried to one of the guys with

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:04.710
Curt Massacre when I was in LA and it

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:06.930
sucked so you're one of the guys and I

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:08.730
tried - one of the guys in and I felt

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:11.580
like such a dumb [ __ ] we're standing

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.900
there and I was like so uh dude Oh

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:23.539
oh now sardius so uh oh my god and uh I

00:55:23.539 --> 00:55:26.210
was a little [ __ ] up after the shows

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:28.250
and we're all out front and I was just

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:29.480
like so like are you working on a new

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:40.490
special why would I ever ask what I

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:41.329
asked

00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:43.640
it is so I would say like this is only

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.349
in standup but it's not because when I

00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:46.880
worked in that real estate office in

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:49.849
college the dude would come in the the

00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:51.470
guy who owned it once a week he would

00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.599
walk in on Fridays he would come up from

00:55:53.599 --> 00:55:55.460
New York or come down from New York go

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:57.410
to the Philly office and just walk by

00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:59.809
the floor and everyone like oh that's

00:55:59.809 --> 00:56:01.789
mr. Jacoby as mr. him they're like you

00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:03.980
want to set up and watch people try to

00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:06.140
like break the ice and he literally I

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:08.059
think I said this before he would only

00:56:08.059 --> 00:56:10.160
talk to someone who closed the deal so

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.539
if you didn't close the deal he wouldn't

00:56:11.539 --> 00:56:13.549
acknowledge your presence but his sister

00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:15.680
work next to me so she would be like I

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.260
can like if you want to say hi I can I

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:19.670
can have you say hi and I'd be like

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:22.220
[ __ ] give a [ __ ] but I'd watch people

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:24.230
literally do that shot take the shot

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:25.970
dude and it was like that was when I

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:27.140
went up to him at the crib but at the

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:28.609
Christmas party they got me all [ __ ]

00:56:28.609 --> 00:56:31.099
drunk I bought him a rose and was like

00:56:31.099 --> 00:56:33.349
that's for you baby and there he was

00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:36.410
just like you bought your boss or rose

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:38.150
at the Christmas party well I was

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:39.440
talking to his wife the whole night and

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.960
I was like I [ __ ] love smoking weed I

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:43.160
was talking his wife about like we this

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.869

00:56:47.779 --> 00:56:49.339
was working in this office I quit

00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:51.650
literally I quit after the Christmas

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:52.940
party but they remember I was just like

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:55.099
I was drinking tequila and showed your

00:56:55.099 --> 00:56:56.150
ass at the Christmas party

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:57.650
dude I never give me shots of tequila

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:59.150
and I'm like yo I don't think I

00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:00.680
understand like I can't I can't have

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.609
this and they're like yeah you'll be

00:57:01.609 --> 00:57:03.589
fine the exact like you got it and I was

00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:05.390
like all right Doug B yes seriously

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:06.799
these guys were all coked the [ __ ] up

00:57:06.799 --> 00:57:08.420
and [ __ ] how adderall's and stuff

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:08.839
awesome

00:57:08.839 --> 00:57:10.309
yeah yeah it's pretty sick watching

00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:12.049
dudes coked up in a business meeting is

00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:13.730
the funniest [ __ ] thing like they'd

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.039
be like you do Cogan would come give a

00:57:16.039 --> 00:57:17.809
keynote and he would come down and be

00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:19.490
like dude the company was the dumbest

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:21.109
made no fun I don't understand how any

00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:22.640
of this worked because they would maybe

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.400
close like one deal a year so the whole

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.599
thing was they're trying to buy

00:57:26.599 --> 00:57:27.660
apartment buildings

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.150
for like millions of dollars less than

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.810
it was worth

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:32.430
they had a bunch of interns calling

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:34.260
pretending to be like real property

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:35.580
people like real estate people being

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:38.640
like saw the property assessed it we're

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.960
interested in putting in an offer one of

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.100
our partners and they'd be like yeah

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:43.350
we're in Kansas City like how did we did

00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:44.940
you look at it I looked at it less she

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:46.320
wouldn't lie but if you had all these

00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.630
interns eventually you would find like

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:50.490
someone who like you know their parents

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:51.720
died they inherited a didn't know what

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:52.770
to do with it and they'd sell it to this

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:55.140
guy so like this whole operation would

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:57.480
go for like to get like one if they

00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.160
closed one they'd be like sick because

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.300
they would make like two million dollars

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.010
and then make a bunch of money you know

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:05.430
and residual with like the rents and

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:07.620
[ __ ] so it was like only one person ever

00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:08.880
would do it so it's like an office of

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.260
people just completely [ __ ] off the

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:11.040
entire time

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.480
yeah and when I was like talking to his

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.310

hot I was fully openly flirting with her

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:26.250
and then like I bought and like I said

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:27.600

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:35.820
I asked for you did on tequila there's

00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:37.380

was how funniest I'm like what the [ __ ]

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.080
is this if so I was co-hosting a show

have you like I'm on stage that's so if

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:28.700
the show like it was a light show so I

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.110
was just like this show [ __ ] sucks

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:31.760
this crowd sucks and just immediately

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.920

next day or texted me [ __ ] you were

really mean you turned on me I was like

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.620
what in my mind I just thought

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.060
immediately after she was like you were

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.130
an [ __ ] last night I was like what

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:48.170

01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:50.150
[ __ ] you what the [ __ ] are you talking

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:51.620
about you're being a [ __ ] and then I

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:52.880

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.620
of me being like girls have dog brain

01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:59.810

like [ __ ] this show and the reason the

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:21.860
show sucks is because women have dog

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:29.480

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.580

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:39.620

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:42.950

that's why it's the cheapest property in

01:09:02.159 --> 01:09:05.460
monopoly Baltic oh yeah that's a it's

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.440
where it's it's weird shifts from

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.799
hongki's into Arabs there's like a combo

01:09:10.799 --> 01:09:13.979

01:09:13.979 --> 01:09:16.019
mishmash of like are you even a honky

01:09:16.019 --> 01:09:18.479
yeah there's something yeah what's going

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:23.999
on I don't like it let me know what's

01:09:23.999 --> 01:09:25.319
going on do we have to [ __ ] invading

01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:26.940
and still democracy here or [ __ ] into

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:27.960
you yeah

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.909
every ever is still democracy in like

01:09:29.909 --> 01:09:33.809
Slovenia I'm sure we [ __ ] that's never

01:09:33.809 --> 01:09:36.359
really been our I mean Bosnia like only

01:09:36.359 --> 01:09:37.589
constantly there the markets that

01:09:37.589 --> 01:09:40.170
constantly crash in Greece yeah well I

01:09:40.170 --> 01:09:42.239
think there's like constantly being like

01:09:42.239 --> 01:09:44.519
we did it it's crashed as Russia's been

01:09:44.519 --> 01:09:46.199
Russia's been but [ __ ] them forever

01:09:46.199 --> 01:09:48.449
really in World War two Germany was

01:09:48.449 --> 01:09:49.949
bought [ __ ] them then they had civil

01:09:49.949 --> 01:09:53.609
wars forever yes sucks seems like an

01:09:53.609 --> 01:09:54.869
easily that was that like the Franz

01:09:54.869 --> 01:09:57.170
Ferdinand squad yeah

01:09:57.170 --> 01:09:59.969
really Serbia he got shot how good

01:09:59.969 --> 01:10:02.099
Serbia how good the politics of Serbia

01:10:02.099 --> 01:10:04.559
ripple out and affect anything because

01:10:04.559 --> 01:10:08.219
Austria Austria was coming at him and

01:10:08.219 --> 01:10:09.420
then Germany was like you know we're

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.190
gonna help you out do you think you

01:10:11.190 --> 01:10:11.969
think I was a setup

01:10:11.969 --> 01:10:14.729
I mean pull people into the World War I

01:10:14.729 --> 01:10:16.619
will have some dumb Slovenian no no if

01:10:16.619 --> 01:10:18.329
it's to pull me into World War but it

01:10:18.329 --> 01:10:20.340
definitely definitely plunged them into

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.170
world because it was like it's just it

01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:23.820
is just dumb [ __ ] yeah but if you were

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.590
like the if you like these they were

01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:27.090
looking for anything to get and nobody

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:28.829
wanted World War one like that nobody

01:10:28.829 --> 01:10:31.260
would try to have it happen so but they

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.610
shot the dude and they're like all right

01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:33.989
and nothing well that was the yeah I

01:10:33.989 --> 01:10:35.579
mean I guess there was like some stuff

01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:37.199
about how the black hand that was the

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:37.829
guys who did it

01:10:37.829 --> 01:10:40.260
kind of had some outside forces being

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.539
like I think that I didn't see something

01:10:42.539 --> 01:10:44.159
that's been forever like the American

01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:45.719
CIA's been wrong the Brit

01:10:45.719 --> 01:10:49.890
mi5 we were that powerful but I feel

01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:51.360
like the Brits we're doing that so it's

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.710
probably getting and their pipes locking

01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:54.750
with every little Brits were not itching

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.270
for a fight with Germany yeah I never

01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:59.640
were but the germs germs wanted a little

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.770
bit of germs were waiting for someone

01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:05.040
they might have been like yeah maybe I

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.260
mean maybe they set themselves up to I

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:09.570
don't know that's a tough one that

01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:12.690
Russia came to defend Serbia really yeah

01:11:12.690 --> 01:11:14.670
yeah so then just like that everybody

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:21.120

flashbang of muscle and then just

01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:49.530
[ __ ] stank out you should take

01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:51.780
steroids flight Brendan Schaub and then

01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:57.480

way home she freaks out and drives into

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.170
oncoming she gets on the wrong lane of

01:24:40.170 --> 01:24:41.760
the highway and goes 70 straight down

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.110
the highway straight into another car

01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:46.290

figure out maybe she had like an abscess

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:51.590
tooth oh let's go to your brain brain up

01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:53.330
maybe they don't know mean usually so

01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:54.980
immense from a tooth like that you get

01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:57.260
like crazy pain first well that's what

01:26:57.260 --> 01:26:58.610
they were saying she was like rubbing a

01:26:58.610 --> 01:27:00.740
jaw for a while she did have an abscess

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:03.980
tooth she did have that look is it

01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.750
possible that that caused her like her

01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:07.970
brain did they examine her brain they

01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:10.190
will the corners were just like the

01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:11.690
autopsy was like all right point one

01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:13.670
nine blood alcohol and that's with a

belly full of vodka that didn't

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:17.180
metabolize yet so it would have been

01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:19.190
even higher if she just chugged a bottle

01:27:19.190 --> 01:27:22.330
of vodka and had weed in her system and

01:27:22.330 --> 01:27:24.880
like she didn't smoke or drink like that

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.490
well it was we don't weed that quickly I

01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:33.080

think they prevent your boobs from like

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.480
being that by every single person being

01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:15.219
seen by everyone if you don't wear a bra

01:42:15.219 --> 01:42:16.960
apparently get NatGeo titties after a

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:18.849
while I was told the opposite about the

01:42:18.849 --> 01:42:20.949

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:47.920

case for history but I'm I'm on some

01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:13.540
future man stuff where it's like this is

01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:17.710
a universal problem ajan a bus full of

01:47:17.710 --> 01:47:19.600
white people mm-hmm which you know

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:22.660

01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:23.830
bus middle of the country but I'll

01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:25.630
[ __ ] middle the country

01:47:25.630 --> 01:47:26.920
there's not a lot of public transit

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:32.170
milah country no [ __ ] cars here I

01:47:32.170 --> 01:47:35.950
don't have a city bus of somehow some

01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:37.150
others all right let's say you're on

01:47:37.150 --> 01:47:39.880
Amtrak and it's just hongki's yeah black

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:42.040
chick comes on in those in yoga pants

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:44.890
and a white dudes like nice ass lady and

01:47:44.890 --> 01:47:46.450
then he looks around the cabin and is

01:47:46.450 --> 01:47:49.030
like what you're [ __ ] wearing it and

01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:53.340
all the white be like yeah yeah [ __ ]

01:47:54.489 --> 01:47:56.679
so what like that's what I thought of

01:47:56.679 --> 01:47:58.179
immediately I was like the inverse of

01:47:58.179 --> 01:48:00.039
that would be the funniest [ __ ] thing

01:48:00.039 --> 01:48:02.530
it'd be like holy [ __ ] no my tree said

01:48:02.530 --> 01:48:05.379
that to a chick on a train in with our

01:48:05.379 --> 01:48:07.659
bus with all hongki's yeah every honky

01:48:07.659 --> 01:48:08.709
in there would be like what are you

01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:10.539
doing well I'm pretty sure this was

01:48:10.539 --> 01:48:12.489
about you this is probably like an

01:48:12.489 --> 01:48:14.409
episode of The Steve Harvey Show you

01:48:14.409 --> 01:48:16.119

everything polish me wearing [ __ ]

01:48:17.589 --> 01:48:18.909
spandex you think logs should be

01:48:18.909 --> 01:48:21.280
dressing like this I think Steve Harvey

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:23.739
would be lie attend I'm also a black

01:48:23.739 --> 01:48:25.539
conservative like you where I agree you

01:48:25.539 --> 01:48:27.369
know 100% that I think baby girl

01:48:27.369 --> 01:48:30.399
deserved the public scolding she got for

01:48:30.399 --> 01:48:33.999
being a pawn on the bus I'm glad

01:48:33.999 --> 01:48:35.619
somebody I'm glad there's a nice

01:48:35.619 --> 01:48:37.659
gentleman in North Philadelphia that had

01:48:37.659 --> 01:48:40.179
the courage to stand up to the POG he

01:48:40.179 --> 01:48:41.709
was why it was a bus full of black

01:48:41.709 --> 01:48:43.299
conservatives dude it was there you

01:48:43.299 --> 01:48:44.619
