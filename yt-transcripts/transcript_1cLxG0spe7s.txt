like you would like to sell them that

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.909
was your boy oh no girls would learn

00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:30.159
magic and medieval island girls still

00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:33.339

a fairer younger girl into a butterfly

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.389
or pool of water then into a butterfly

they introduced that and where they drew

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.130

60 not anymore

00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:26.399

00:19:26.399 --> 00:19:28.350
Illinois petition you earlier 16 okay

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.710

so sick the dudes in Illinois were like

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.659
ah I'm not gonna [ __ ] go down lightly

00:19:36.659 --> 00:19:39.600
on this no the problem is if that like

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.130
art petitioning Flint's water 16 year

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.649
old snares was on the table and their

00:19:45.649 --> 00:19:51.630
country we will march yeah they know the

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.210
problem with like categories is that we

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.120
exist in a like a total continuum like

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.710
age is just a number we make up which

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.059

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:02.130
pedophile you're sick you should I not

don't see kids but at the same time it's

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:10.529
like 16 17 18 true that we hit a [ __ ]

00:20:10.529 --> 00:20:12.419
we that's a permanent mark we go yeah I

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.460
guess about right here so it's like our

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.070
Kelly was in there's a deep pool and our

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.510
Kelly was standing in like the beginning

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.429
of the shallow end with his chin just

00:20:20.429 --> 00:20:24.809
above water people are like yeah wasn't

00:20:24.809 --> 00:20:28.830

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:36.700
14 14 CR Kelly's looked like a well

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.710
14 all right okay but here and this is

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.330
what Michael great is that

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:47.870
Frey 80 but if you're very much a or if

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:50.090
you're very advanced freshman year

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:53.779
placement he was 33rd he's young dude

00:20:53.779 --> 00:20:58.850
there is the new eighth grade well well

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.529
Muslim was half your age plus seven

00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:07.880
excuse me Shane have you read roots it

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.140
was in the book roots we started very

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.520
beginning with the tribes over there

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.529
Muslim Wall half your age plus seven so

00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:13.970
30 would be 50 so that was just like a

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.279
creepy dude the bad that's so that still

00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:19.940
puts you at later 24 or 23 which is

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:29.000
perfect 30 and 23 it's not by the way 30

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.169
and 23 not that great her family society

00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:35.270
shaming you as a good glorious podcaster

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.399
true everybody's trying to bring me down

00:21:37.399 --> 00:21:42.380
oh yeah Muslim lost aids what so if

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.600
you're a 30 year old man it's 15 plus 7

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.950
so that'd be 20 to 22 and 30 great

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.010
perfect I mean is what it is

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.590

auditioning and you didn't get picked

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.580
you probably knew utilizing the

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.920
Australian voice right you were watching

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:07.920

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.340
damn what you brought up about when he's

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.770
like dry humping the stage and everyone

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:17.200
wild that was the case that I try hoping

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.660
what wasn't dry humping well it was a

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:20.590
little wet

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:24.820
[Laughter]

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.030
did you see you didn't see the document

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:29.580
no this is just a cutscene where it's

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:34.020
just a station what happened well I was

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.400
just saying it he's helping the stage

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.620
but no I intend from personal experience

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.300
I can say that like when you are doing

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.310
that when I I didn't lip-sync in front

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:44.120
of an auditorium

00:44:47.240 --> 00:45:00.870
you could relive that right now I'm

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.610
gonna be so happy to do it

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:12.180
yes just will be over before some

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:30.120
tension no it is 100% your most your

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:34.280
crowd you've ever had do it

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.499
now this is obviously gonna be a failure

00:45:39.499 --> 00:45:41.539
but I will fail no this is good well the

00:45:41.539 --> 00:45:48.470
tables in the way but is there

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:52.309
particular music you get a rock with me

00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:56.119
please rock with me just three seconds

00:45:56.119 --> 00:45:58.970
moves dude alright wait wait let's see

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:00.529
if they can get music if they can't if

00:46:00.529 --> 00:46:02.329
they can't just do it without it but I

00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:04.549
got a decent feeling someone can cue up

00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:08.839
some objects you remember it yeah dude

00:46:08.839 --> 00:46:14.859
what song you remember the song Wow

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:17.569
please fine black or white if they don't

00:46:17.569 --> 00:46:26.599
I'll play it my phone I'll give these so

00:46:26.599 --> 00:46:29.869
the tail because see this is my demo

00:46:29.869 --> 00:46:35.799
it's gonna be just you buy a camera okay

00:46:35.799 --> 00:46:39.049
so the I did decide to perform this lip

00:46:39.049 --> 00:46:43.220
sync in first place because you got

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.349
first yeah do you think it was one of

00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:49.970
those like I have arthritis yeah sorry I

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.140
was going for it like do you think like

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.799
a really good juggler lost like a really

00:46:54.799 --> 00:46:56.720
well put together juggler lost was like

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:00.339
no I don't have a [ __ ] deformity so

00:47:00.339 --> 00:47:05.080
[ __ ] arthritis MJ just crushed

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:09.140
so uh with first place and then about

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:13.820
ready later my French teacher comes up

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:14.930
to me and she's like hey I heard great

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:16.340
things about that Michael Jackson lips

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.990
like he did want you before me for the

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:22.460
French class whoo and chocolate boo dude

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:28.400
yes but I'm too prone to fantasy and so

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:32.330
I thought I was gonna go with and but

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:33.950
basically I showed up and this is what I

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:35.900
was thinking with the nut grabbing like

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.930
I showed up to French class and then I

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:42.460
got changed into regalia

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.050
doing it in front of a French class is a

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:50.000
vastly different experience then that's

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.250
the beginning with Macaulay Culkin yes

00:48:06.799 --> 00:48:15.429
I think the speakers on the bottom

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.700
[Music]

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.090
once you hear the music it's all over

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:24.159
[Music]

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:30.850
I guess

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:34.059
[Laughter]

00:48:34.059 --> 00:48:37.700
how's the back not getting this in the

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.319
back will you just tell us when it's

00:48:39.319 --> 00:48:46.339
ready somehow that was the intro in the

00:48:46.339 --> 00:48:48.470
music video right was it like Macaulay

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:49.880

dad

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:52.970
you won't understand and then MJ shows

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:56.210
up and said come with me and everybody

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:59.359
in America was like alright that's a

structured tool like a brief

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.680

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.530
they throat they they have proven and

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:34.240
this doesn't like you know prove a point

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.000
or not but they have proven in in like

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.369
male female sexuality it was like the

01:03:39.369 --> 01:03:42.160
Kinsey study I think that women have

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.839
some sort of psychological separator

01:03:43.839 --> 01:03:46.470
between like mental and genital arousal

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:49.750
really yes Michael I sense no news real

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:51.940
so the kid in the case they did this

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:54.040
study where like they would show they

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.390
did it with guys and girls so they had

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:57.550
like a like a little study setup so get

01:03:57.550 --> 01:03:59.290
guys into basically computing booth and

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:00.700
like it would sit there and like watch

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.680
them and they show him all kinds of porn

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.180
they put like a I figure what it's

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.339
called it's like a boner meter so I get

01:04:06.339 --> 01:04:06.640
it

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.410
literally it hard just like it like

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:10.960
measures blood flow and expansion and in

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.180
a flaccid penis and they would show guys

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.069
like you know like poor self you know

01:04:15.069 --> 01:04:16.359
what they probably use that thing you

01:04:16.359 --> 01:04:17.890
used to like check your blood pressure

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:21.550
CBS or you sit there they probably aside

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:27.970
you stick their dick in it they would so

01:04:27.970 --> 01:04:31.510
then they would have like a they measure

01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:34.390
like brainwaves and like don waves and

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:35.859
they would show guys have increasingly

01:04:35.859 --> 01:04:37.780
like kind of weird [ __ ] so they'd have

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.549
like you know the girl flicking her bean

01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:41.530
that lady gotta go [ __ ] all this

01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:43.119
stuff they go through the game and all

01:04:43.119 --> 01:04:45.040
of a sudden they'd have like animals

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.410
[ __ ] and they see the guys like brain

01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:49.630
waves the same one still go and their

01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:51.099
dick waves kind of like that thing would

01:04:51.099 --> 01:04:53.559
be [ __ ] the velcro reversed in maybe

01:04:53.559 --> 01:04:55.270
like oh [ __ ] like this is like a natural

01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:57.640
sexual response and they did it with

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.040
women and then they would see like the

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:01.630
whole thing and they do like the animal

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:02.980
sex and they see this it like

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.630
scientifically would see the same like

01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:07.390
genital secretion and the brain stuff

01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:09.940
would be off yes yes think about it dude

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:14.440
so Kirby's your point about being China

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.140
does not enjoy women's vaginas being

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:19.619
spin it on

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:24.000
let me say it you think Michael faced

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.850

01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:31.650

try to help you alright stop using words

01:32:37.359 --> 01:32:43.059
like posses just [ __ ] rich black our

01:32:43.059 --> 01:32:45.129
bosses are them are truthfully very

01:32:45.129 --> 01:32:50.169
dangerous you're trying to here you're

01:32:50.169 --> 01:32:51.340
on the hot seat you're trying to save

01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:53.909
football teams

01:32:54.210 --> 01:32:58.229
[Laughter]

01:32:58.229 --> 01:33:05.769
introducing the Albuquerque rich the

01:33:05.769 --> 01:33:07.539
Brigid they get they killed they killed

01:33:07.539 --> 01:33:09.159
a dog to start the game

01:33:09.159 --> 01:33:11.110
they're killing a bunch of dogs I got

01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:13.389
another point I think the point is there

01:33:13.389 --> 01:33:15.550
Lynch lack guys this was the point he

01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:17.769
was making which was if you were the

01:33:17.769 --> 01:33:20.229
leader of a rich black guy posse you're

01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:21.849
not gonna be the one killing the dogs

01:33:21.849 --> 01:33:24.849
yeah you're gonna you got minions and I

01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:27.369
said that Michael Vick was like in love

01:33:27.369 --> 01:33:29.709
with these dogs cuz he was into fighting

01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:31.929
them and he like trained them and all

01:33:31.929 --> 01:33:34.150
that [ __ ] so when like a dog lost and

01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:35.860
they went to put it down he'd be the one

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.570
to be like that's my dog I'm putting it

01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:40.419
down like wait actually that's like

01:33:40.419 --> 01:33:41.499
honorable that's like the beginning the

01:33:41.499 --> 01:33:45.669
first episode of Game of Thrones you if

01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:48.130
you if you pass the sentence you [ __ ]

01:33:48.130 --> 01:33:49.869
yes yeah that's I mean that was my

01:33:49.869 --> 01:33:52.380
argument the entire time all right

01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:54.939
person I mean that makes you a terrible

01:33:54.939 --> 01:33:57.789
person cuz it's not Game of Thrones it's

01:33:57.789 --> 01:34:00.880
real life and these are just dogs and

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.079
you don't need to be doing that you know

01:34:02.079 --> 01:34:03.579
what if your dog got bit up for a bad

01:34:03.579 --> 01:34:05.260
fight that's exactly what would happen

01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:06.849
and then they would kill it if the dog

01:34:06.849 --> 01:34:08.229
lost they would kill it why didn't they

01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:09.939
