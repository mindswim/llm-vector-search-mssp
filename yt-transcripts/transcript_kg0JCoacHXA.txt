00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.030

cracked it I [ __ ] Teddy yeah came home

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.820
I presume from like a shower I'm like yo

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.750
something that came home and there was

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.190
just a black dude sitting on his steps

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.390
he was like oh yeah I help you out I

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.229
just stood up and [ __ ] him up oh it

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.430
was like two weeks ago he's still got

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.240
black eye like he couldn't see it's so

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.979
funny to think about adult comma is it

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.720
comic getting like beat up by a random

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.820
black dude and like slowly kind of being

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.369
a little racist now [ __ ] yeah

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.930
you know I mean that's gonna change you

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.159
some way you [ __ ] come home i I think

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.900
that would definitely turn you up a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.470
degree

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.290
yeah Alvey sit there he's an alt comic

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.729
so he'll probably be like at a black

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.979
lives matter rally then just a part of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.420
it will be like hit so hard

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.479
why are you racist Teddy he's like well

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.560
well I was walking home guy said was he

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.939
a black eyes yeah yeah he was he punched

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.770
me in the face he came down on the steps

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.630
it was just like wham bam bam

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.310
hilarious and walked i don't you talk

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.829
anything i think it was just a now this

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.479
is all just according to Teddy Hansen

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.849
yeah but he's doing as a bit

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.290
that's unstructured so he's just telling

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.299
the actual story so he's not like in Joe

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.859
for like I just don't trust someone

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.689
who's like some guy kicked my ass for no

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.489
reason what the [ __ ] are you doing

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.980
true oh definitely that's a weird story

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.290
always I'd love to believe some guy was

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.200
like you said perched up picked one like

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.670
The Strangers dude just like cuz you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.670
were home but also if you're a black

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.530
dude and you see Teddy Hanson you're

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.370
gonna want to punch him in the face

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.170
that's true you know you could probably

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.540
[ __ ] Ted he's a great dude by the way he

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.239
is actually why he's great dude he looks

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.069
like he's not a great though I don't see

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.919
a lot of black people in Philadelphia

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.400
taking him seriously

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.959
you know what I mean like if Teddy Teddy

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.609
would not do well in the hood is what

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.290
I'm trying to say no he's for the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.049
listener he's got long blond hair

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.560
mustache blond fu-manchu's surfer dude

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:18.139
kind of guy surf though seems like a

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.040
boogie board designer for the hell away

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.549
he's a nice guy

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.879
Teddy is but he looks like and talks

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.280
like on stage he talks like a an all

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.530
comic that I would [ __ ] hate yes but

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.150
then you get to know him and he's not

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.560
he's a great dude he's a nice guy he's

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.259
also Central PA bull why I think he's

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.840
like Chambersburg at Gettysburg really

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.189
and he's a good boy

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:41.930
he'd probably had to he already had some

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.400
reservations about black people going

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.979
into that maybe that's what happened

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.349
maybe you had a few too many PBR is at

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.479
the alt show came back it was like what

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:53.379

he tells his people to stand up if they

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.540

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.570

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.100

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:22.459
music oh please get over it experience e

00:13:22.459 --> 00:13:23.779
theory that like kim jeong-hoon

00:13:23.779 --> 00:13:26.180
is gonna disarm nuclear and stuff it's

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.160
gonna work out whatever else but he's

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.990
only doing it because Putin is in his

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.880
ear being like you need to song whatever

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.770
else to get Trump another four years and

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.480
re-elected after he solves the Korean

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.329
crisis so that Putin can still influence

00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:40.250
Trump and American stuff that's

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.110
conspiracy theory I heard it but it's

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:46.310
interesting wrong debunk I thought you

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.600
were gonna have him on the line on that

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:53.660
and yeah interesting work if perhaps if

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.520
he hadn't taken line head mushrooms

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:03.260
today really really the United States

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.640
Russia and North Korea are the ones who

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.350
are in cahoots right now in the EU and

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.149
Canada against those three dude the

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.120
globalist the globalist want for the

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.310
United States to get nuclear fallout

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.520
with either North Korea or Russia

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.690
preferably Russia so that way to fall

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.100
out so disastrous they can start a

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.660
one-world government new world order

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.490
take over that's why they're running

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.930
stuff against the fact that even P

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.579
nuclearized North Korea that's why they

00:14:28.579 --> 00:14:31.970
press is like so uh [ __ ] they want

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.050
us to go to [ __ ] war

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.110
nuclear war yeah okay yeah I do I think

like you're a bully when people bully me

00:53:13.239 --> 00:53:14.709

00:53:16.089 --> 00:53:18.429
one time the older kids who are like you

00:53:18.429 --> 00:53:19.599
know I was like I thinking

00:53:19.599 --> 00:53:21.670
sixth grade the eighth graders would

00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:22.689
like come out and beat us up and like

00:53:22.689 --> 00:53:24.219
bully us but they still like the one

00:53:24.219 --> 00:53:26.319
time this one guy cool as [ __ ] Adam Rock

00:53:26.319 --> 00:53:29.199
was Adam shout out of Rock he like

00:53:29.199 --> 00:53:30.759
pointed out this nerd in their class and

00:53:30.759 --> 00:53:32.529
he enlisted me and my cousin to beat up

00:53:32.529 --> 00:53:34.390
an older nerd so like we got in a fight

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:36.219
over just being like yeah oh [ __ ] this

00:53:36.219 --> 00:53:38.109
guy oh yeah did that tell you got in

00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:39.549
trouble it's like so like when you're

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:40.749
when you're like you know you're the

00:53:40.749 --> 00:53:42.219
recess yard you're in the [ __ ] ranks

00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:43.509
dude you're like beating up nerds and

00:53:43.509 --> 00:53:45.549
[ __ ] you make it through that life you

00:53:45.549 --> 00:53:46.959
like you're you're the victor and that

00:53:46.959 --> 00:53:48.910
phase your life but when you catch like

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:52.119
heavy like peer trauma and like sixth

00:53:52.119 --> 00:53:53.679
grade like when you do a performance and

00:53:53.679 --> 00:53:55.809
the whole school laughs see you I can't

00:53:55.809 --> 00:53:57.609
imagine how bad that [ __ ] you up for

00:53:57.609 --> 00:53:58.719
later in life because like you didn't

00:53:58.719 --> 00:54:01.390
even like I got mostly flattened by life

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:03.309
like in the last like four years or so

00:54:03.309 --> 00:54:04.539
but like I made it

00:54:04.539 --> 00:54:06.640
a lot of years ago getting crushed so

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.709
I'm kind of like I had that base level

00:54:08.709 --> 00:54:10.539
confidence from just like basically

00:54:10.539 --> 00:54:12.819
preying on people when I was legit I

00:54:12.819 --> 00:54:14.199
have that I've been preying on that

00:54:14.199 --> 00:54:15.609
makes sense I was standing the bus stop

00:54:15.609 --> 00:54:17.169

Horvath was standing there he's a big

00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:48.160
dog real big dog he's quiet but he's

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.640
abused like a Snorlax you run if you run

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:54.099
into him in the cave you're trouble you

00:54:54.099 --> 00:54:56.259
say well he was just standing I'm there

00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:58.509
I was standing on top of a there was

00:54:58.509 --> 00:55:03.160
like a concrete light post yeah on top

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.779
of the Congress holding close above

00:55:04.779 --> 00:55:10.209
everyone Horvath was down there and then

00:55:10.209 --> 00:55:12.400
Gabe walked by my one friend Gabe who

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.069
used to pick on but he's the man but he

00:55:15.069 --> 00:55:17.199
was walking by and I was like Corvette

00:55:17.199 --> 00:55:19.809
[ __ ] just red like they just started

00:55:19.809 --> 00:55:22.779
fighting that could be you got water

00:55:22.779 --> 00:55:25.299
like a water which move on like a water

00:55:25.299 --> 00:55:27.279
jet painting which I caught her painting

00:55:27.279 --> 00:55:29.140
Renaissance panic yeah I was thinking

00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.150
like watercolor watercolor painting what

00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:32.559
I could make a watercolor painting of

00:55:32.559 --> 00:55:33.880
your childhood is you standing on a

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.709
cement light barrier there's a pointing

00:55:35.709 --> 00:55:39.039
at two other kids to fight each other

00:55:39.039 --> 00:55:41.409
but I think it was like I didn't think

00:55:41.409 --> 00:55:42.880
they would actually fight like I think I

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.140
think it was probably me and Jared

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.539
because he was an instigator to this day

00:55:46.539 --> 00:55:48.969
yeah where we were like horvath Gabe

00:55:48.969 --> 00:55:50.619
said he could [ __ ] you up it was one of

00:55:50.619 --> 00:55:53.229
those yes yeah it was like no no I'll

00:55:53.229 --> 00:55:53.799
[ __ ] you up

00:55:53.799 --> 00:55:56.709
fight I mean imagine beautiful games a

00:55:56.709 --> 00:55:59.229
big dog games [ __ ] monster no I think

00:55:59.229 --> 00:56:00.819
I think Horvath probably gave him the

00:56:00.819 --> 00:56:02.709
business we were young Gabe grew in it I

00:56:02.709 --> 00:56:05.409
got you Gabe was like he was like a

00:56:05.409 --> 00:56:08.069
Great Dane puppy when he was younger he

00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:10.599
could not he would fall he was good at

00:56:10.599 --> 00:56:12.489
basketball but he would fall make sense

00:56:12.489 --> 00:56:14.469
and he was like there's a newborn home

00:56:14.469 --> 00:56:16.599
he was real awkward but then he grew it

00:56:16.599 --> 00:56:16.930
he got

00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:18.640
good at basketball but like his senior

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.339

if they're gonna do it or not you just

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.619

00:56:35.619 --> 00:56:38.380
was in seventh grade there was these two

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.369

nothing would if it whatever whatever

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:54.430

that was early dude some of my earliest

00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:30.250
ventures out into reality we're just

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:31.540

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.750
about each other like oh yeah perfectly

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:36.339

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.930
someone to lose their job and it's

01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:35.530

the worst conversation it's all you can

01:06:06.499 --> 01:06:09.529

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.999
easy but he's [ __ ] tired of it and

01:06:19.999 --> 01:06:21.469
everybody is so I make eye contact with

I think they ancient aliens had me on

01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:49.369
the hook for me makes perfect sense

01:14:49.369 --> 01:14:51.469
yeah I'd watch that and I remember I'd

01:14:51.469 --> 01:14:53.179
watch ancient aliens and then I go to my

01:14:53.179 --> 01:14:55.099
job doing demolition in the labor union

01:14:55.099 --> 01:14:57.230

would talk aliens all day let me pick

01:15:06.199 --> 01:15:08.150
trash out of the ground I go do it

01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:09.650
exactly but tell me about that's another

01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:12.460
thing also with dirt bikes how that

01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:14.719
transcends both white trash and poor

01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:17.090
black people conspiracy theories 100%

01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:18.769
white trash and black people just eat

01:15:18.769 --> 01:15:19.880
that [ __ ] up

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.340
oh for sure for sure there's just one

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:23.659
car to me that's really well made it's

01:15:23.659 --> 01:15:25.250
like 50 minutes long it's almost an hour

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:27.710
and it's about how people from Mars

01:15:27.710 --> 01:15:29.420
existed and they came down and they had

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.190
magic powers and [ __ ] and then but

01:15:31.190 --> 01:15:32.809
what's weird is that the other group of

01:15:32.809 --> 01:15:35.199
people that fought them were Jews and

01:15:35.199 --> 01:15:37.610
there's a whole thing

01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:39.510
Oh how like

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:42.000
what's that old Aquarius or whatever was

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.790
that city in the Atlantis Atlantis

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:46.860
yeah Jewish people made Atlantis with

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:54.180
magic or something about conspiracy

01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:56.730
theories do usually divide them to the

01:15:56.730 --> 01:15:57.390
Jews

01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:59.190
yeah it struck me as odd they're like

01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:00.540
one of these groups as have made-up

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:01.739
people and then the other ones like a

01:16:01.739 --> 01:16:05.970
real thick sore animates weld on it like

01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:08.640
nice well as somebody who lives in New

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.370

01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:14.270
get lumped into like magical flights

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:16.739
Jews in New York are like this is

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:19.250
medieval like what are these guys doing

01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:22.170

01:22:10.610 --> 01:23:03.570
at the house playing video games so we

01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:06.000
would play we play NHS we would play on

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.070
HL and it was always me and Matt first

01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:12.929
wooden six and Beezer and wood and I was

01:23:12.929 --> 01:23:14.730
I was I'm really good at a child [ __ ]

01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:16.469
and that's bad but I could you know I

01:23:16.469 --> 01:23:17.880
guess not but he knows how to play his

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:22.199
role he knows I'm gonna [ __ ] feed him

01:23:22.199 --> 01:23:23.639
the park knows there's gonna be some

01:23:23.639 --> 01:23:25.619
one-timers and especially what made it

01:23:25.619 --> 01:23:27.270
better was having him be the one to

01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:35.969
score good enough to make Matt be the

01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:38.130
one who won for us so I could be like

01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:43.230
lucky I'm not so good so we be playing

01:23:43.230 --> 01:23:46.080
and they their team was so fragile the

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.550
Beezer would would turn on each other so

01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:49.800
easy like all you had to do is be like

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:53.130
which one you guys is red who's got the

01:23:53.130 --> 01:23:54.810

01:23:54.810 --> 01:23:55.020
guys

01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:57.659
then whoever it would be like whoever it

01:23:57.659 --> 01:24:00.500
was not red we got I know

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:03.030
give me the [ __ ] [ __ ] you ran this

01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:06.260
plan number of times you

01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:11.590
then that would let me clue in cuz I

01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:13.570
would stir cuz I was better than six I

01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:31.240
was like there's another time there's

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.960
also one where I think it was you verse

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:39.160
6 where I played you from the couch may

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.040
remember that you he was playing so 6

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:43.240
was standing there with the good they

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.560
were both sitting right in front of TV

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.060
and I was on the couch I was on the

01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:49.690
couch behind him playing as 6 that was

01:24:49.690 --> 01:25:21.490
off probably the second-best of clothes

01:25:21.490 --> 01:25:26.020
I guess I think you did was funny about

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.460
that what I did beat you I would just

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:28.990
there was nothing it was like I was

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:30.580
beaten down so bad that even like a

01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:36.130
little bit just like this is fine games

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:43.540
they were like 12 to 1 good turn it on

01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.220
the third period you would let us play

01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:46.600
and then you would [ __ ] hunker down

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.490
like have a deep exhale I was like ah

01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:51.400
here it comes so [ __ ] lame oh good

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:56.940
seriously lean forward in the chairs

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:01.040
comedy discord any challenge

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.680
that's awful so you played hard the

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.870
whole game and you [ __ ] roll me 12 to

01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:08.420
1 and then at the very end of it I had

01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:09.770
gone through the ups and downs of like

01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:11.300
I'm trying I'm giving up I'm trying to

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.920
laugh with you about how bad I am I'm

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.320
trying to I'm giving up again and it was

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.940
the end of the last minute counting down

01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:19.400
and it's like you picked a fight with my

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:19.880
goalie

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.440
and I hit the triangle the [ __ ]

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.970
accepted by accident and then you beat

01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:31.400
the [ __ ] [ __ ] at my little fight

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.140
until the first couple blood was soaked

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:34.700
with like the way you would commentate

01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:36.200
on the games was so far like I would

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:39.140

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:52.730
lag he's try and skate to the so dude

01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:54.230
getting you to to turn on each other was

01:26:54.230 --> 01:26:56.960
like my favorite [ __ ] Tavares laughs

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.340

01:26:58.340 --> 01:26:59.720

like a storytelling show but it's done

01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:55.040
by stand-up so it's like a single

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.590
narrative thing but it's serious

01:27:57.590 --> 01:28:02.770
