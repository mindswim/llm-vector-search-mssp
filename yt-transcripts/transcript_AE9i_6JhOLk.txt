00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.750
president jumping up and clicking his

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.540

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.739
they got fascists like pro-russians

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.120
dominated by Russia now yeah and like

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.069
half the country wants to be Russian

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.189
wants to be dominant there half the half

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.760
Ukrainians or subs real [ __ ] hard

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.129
power bottoms it's also like nobody's

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.449
getting stoked on like you're like

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.750
Ukrainian pride you resize Ukraine

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.090
bashes yeah the fascists in Ukraine are

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.409
like dude we're the best

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.750
but that's fascist to be fascist no it's

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.599
it's fascist be like commies yeah damn

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.549
Ukraine had a big thing like it if you

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.379
lose to communists aren't you like no

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.879
longer allowed to be a fascist

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.199
yeah but then they would resist there

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.470
was resistance groups okay so then like

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.549
is that the whole point of it being like

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.109
yeah but fascism is better and stronger

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.239
and if you lose the communism has to be

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.329

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:29.970
I thought fascism in generals was like

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.620
communism sucks so bad we're better at

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.419

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.110
that the whole time all those countries

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.270

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.879
Nash lost okay why I thought fascism you

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.650
have to like inherently spread out and

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.029
start like dominating everyone around

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:10.009
you know you can just be isolationist

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.229
and fascist like yeah yeah yeah I mean

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.810
typically they try to expand yeah but

yeah pretty tell you

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:17.870

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.029

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.300
a whole new thing that I'm still working

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.490
on even unveiling cuz I to complicate oh

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.620
you're just you're unveiling new things

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.089
every week that's true that's what the

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:34.069
hope for the point of the cast to sit

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:36.979
down and hear you say that what new

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.599
thing are you doing it's my interaction

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.659
grid right now but right now um I mean

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:43.430
I've been reconstructing my entire

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.139
psyche for the last like a year and a

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.629
half that's dangerous roundup very

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:50.180
dangerous territory vices very very

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.129
necessary

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:54.189
variants it's very unsettling to just

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:55.149
just strip

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:56.649
I mean Descartes did it do it is you

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:58.149
know it is what it is same thing you

00:06:58.149 --> 00:06:59.889
strip all your logical assumptions away

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:01.300
I did this once when I was like 23 and

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.499
ended up with like a real nasty eye

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:05.229
infection this is real this is real what

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:07.029
that's when I lived in my house of all I

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:08.889
can you were like I'm just gonna let

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:10.149
everything live in here yeah I'm gonna

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:11.679
live in it so that's what I didn't I

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:13.719
didn't believe in germ theory eyes

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:15.999
shunned germ theory at 23 shunned pretty

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:17.769
much anything someone told me was real

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:19.330
that I didn't directly experience I was

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.069
like I can't trust that if you went like

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:23.229
personally into the dark ages yeah yeah

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:25.779
23 it was pretty tight you're just like

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.550
yeah germs are real what was funny I had

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.019
this was I like hated everything back

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:30.550
then I was like I'm I was in college I

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.469
was like as I was in business school

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:34.179
like this sucks I don't even care about

00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:35.800
this [ __ ] this is what everyone cares

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.959
about [ __ ] this this sucks and then I

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.059
was like somehow like charms aren't real

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:41.889
then like living in a house by myself

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:43.479

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.650
so funny when Trump was like doing like

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.030
people were asking him questions what

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.280

I don't know if that's true but

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.520
apparently she married her brother I

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.000
don't know

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.860
and everybody on the left was like oh my

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.320
god how can you accuse someone of this

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.390
and then every [ __ ] person on the

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.430
left is like you know Trump [ __ ] his

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.000
daughter every day you guys are out

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.500

his wife's a [ __ ] yeah and then it's

00:13:16.209 --> 00:13:17.680
like Trump's like I don't know I heard

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.870
maybe

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.950
he married her brother and everyone's

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.740
like that's over the line he's claiming

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.500
that the chant was Hunter Beck was

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.730
provocateurs

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:34.089
with me I mean not hardcore

00:13:34.089 --> 00:13:38.620
I mean less than that I'm gonna say this

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.060
is like I didn't want to be outshine in

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.510
the black I'm actually wearing white to

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:47.709
someone else's wedding dude report is

00:13:47.709 --> 00:13:52.750
very humble everyone's pretty chill by

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.190
conservatives dude when they score a

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.570
touchdown they hand the ball to the ref

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.220
for sure dude jog back to the huddle

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.529
yeah we might we let the white black

00:13:59.529 --> 00:14:01.080
conservatives do all the celebrating

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.000
[Laughter]

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.260
that's true I am kind of a [ __ ] hot

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.910
dog you hot dog a little Oh dude I'd

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.680
even talk about I didn't get any was

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.100
talking about so it's my interaction

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.670
grid I was in a I find myself a lot of

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.110
the times like pulling into the Whole

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.220
Foods parking lot again we're talking

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.630
about on the page like driving while

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.339
high trying to get out of the practice

00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:23.050
of driving Ohioan edibles it just

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.970
happens that way sometimes it's a lot of

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.800
times I what happened some I mean the

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.370
whole foods like uncomfortably high I

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.110
would say at least once a week so I

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.699
pulled up in the parking lot I pulled up

00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:35.260
in like a little garage and I I started

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.480
thinking about my like my grid of

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.940
interaction so it's like every so like

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.350
you interact with all these people

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.910
throughout the day and then when people

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.230
when people are kind of like jammed up

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.230
about whatever X Y Z in their life in

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.329
order to like put it into concrete terms

00:14:49.329 --> 00:14:51.550
what I was thinking is you have to go

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.010
out into like your little your little

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.170
grid of interaction and they start to

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.300
alter every single constant interact if

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.430
you like a habitual interaction with

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.500
people you have to then break it down by

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.149
person by person and started detecting

00:15:04.149 --> 00:15:05.560
like we're a bunch of weird stuffs

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.329
coming from because it could be coming

00:15:07.329 --> 00:15:09.130
from not even from those people but the

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.410
way you transact socially with people

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.870
does that make sense like sometimes

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.190
people will just naturally assume a

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.990
submissive role within an interaction in

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.240
a very small way yeah so it's like you

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.889
have to kind of like go through all your

00:15:20.889 --> 00:15:22.779
interactions and then learn how to be

00:15:22.779 --> 00:15:25.149
like this is a thing that I don't like

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:27.279
going on and evil like verbalize that

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:29.139
within all of your interactions across

00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:31.000
the span of all yeah and then rework

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.560
interaction by interaction till you've

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.940
maybe that'll help you yeah I have

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.319
interactions with certain people that

00:15:35.319 --> 00:15:37.899
are just you make fun of each other yeah

00:15:37.899 --> 00:15:39.610
and you can't get out like me and Gerber

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.449
yeah you're like it's like you're

00:15:41.449 --> 00:15:43.489
achtung uh your gridlock doesn't fit but

00:15:43.489 --> 00:15:44.869
your gridlocked in a very specific

00:15:44.869 --> 00:15:47.540
interaction gurbin it's a bit it's like

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.209
I Boy him every time I talk to him and I

00:15:50.209 --> 00:15:51.259
can't get out of it

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:53.149
yeah I feel like if he's like not

00:15:53.149 --> 00:15:54.829
feeling good we just won't talk he's

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.720
like I can't handle that conversation

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.889
I'm like I'm not gonna be mean to you

00:15:57.889 --> 00:16:00.429
yes like what's wrong to you you [ __ ]

00:16:00.429 --> 00:16:03.290
well it happens in like a really small

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.269
level even like the way you like present

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:06.739
like I was like again I'm walking

00:16:06.739 --> 00:16:08.629
through Whole Foods and like you'll bump

00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:10.879
carts I'll be like sorry and like I

00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:12.709
instantly apologize I go sorry and I'll

00:16:12.709 --> 00:16:14.329
feel myself catching this like cringed

00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:16.609
posture a lot where I'm like like we're

00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:18.139
both in each other's way it's like that

00:16:18.139 --> 00:16:19.489
I have like that servant blood in me

00:16:19.489 --> 00:16:22.519
English I was like yeah but so yeah that

00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:23.829
was my whole idea of going through

00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:25.879
interaction by interaction and then you

00:16:25.879 --> 00:16:28.160
had so while I'm in the food shopping

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.019
and then I'm interacting with like

00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:31.939
strangers I'm like what the [ __ ] is this

00:16:31.939 --> 00:16:33.439
about so my talking to the cashier to

00:16:33.439 --> 00:16:35.209
get my [ __ ] fruit bowl and I'm just

00:16:35.209 --> 00:16:37.189
like what's the best thing to go about

00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:38.449
this I'm like maybe this is just to

00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:40.369
learn how to go about all my other my

00:16:40.369 --> 00:16:42.019
real day-to-day interactions so I'm like

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:44.569
I'm talking this lady I'm like please

00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:46.399
don't just this trying to just not weird

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:50.449
this lady I can't be good yes you're

00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:52.160
weirding me out I'm like it's a very

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.439
very it gets really that this stuff gets

00:16:54.439 --> 00:16:57.529
it flies close to pick up artists world

00:16:57.529 --> 00:16:59.029
where it's like you engineer

00:16:59.029 --> 00:17:01.039
interactions but you do have to be

00:17:01.039 --> 00:17:02.720
conscious of what you're it's like it's

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.130
not your engineering it you're just

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.470
conscious of how what is going on in an

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.630
interaction like what's the point of it

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.069
why is it this way like you know it's

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.740
very kind of bothered some people do

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.600
that yeah it's uncomfortable I'm sure

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.399
people are like this is what I want to

00:17:16.399 --> 00:17:17.659
get out of this interaction

00:17:17.659 --> 00:17:18.860
yeah and they start talking to you and

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.689
it's like oh I get very uncomfortable

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:23.449
and I back away from all interaction

00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:25.279
period but I'd argue that it's already

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:27.470
subtextual like even in bringing about

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.580
even if you're saying you're not going

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.200
nology there's still a subtext you'll

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.720
not agenda obviously there's always a

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.179
subtext to any [ __ ] there sure so

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.590
what's wrong with being coming aware of

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.000
it becoming aware of it and like

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.220
planning it is we not planning but is

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.929
being hyper aware and then if there's

00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:43.340
something that actors a lot of times

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.299
there might be something that's

00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:45.710
legitimately bothering you about a

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.240
certain interaction yeah and then

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.210
bringing that to light and being like

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.770
it's for me it works am I like in

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.510
romantic relationships now or do I just

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.910
bring up the thing the way I feel that's

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.530
negative about whatever the person's

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.850
doing rather than be like you're [ __ ]

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.280
annoying I'll be like that makes me that

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.600
makes me feel kind of shitty in there

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.030
just like oh I'm so sorry Lola so again

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.950
this is this is so you're winning

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.250
arguments but this super pet comes up in

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:10.420
a relationship I thought you're gonna be

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:18.640
getting all sorts of sex here first I

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.860
can have sex that's up there was sex

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.020
it's like a long relationship we've all

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.690
for sure oh dude for [ __ ] sure good

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.360
like sorry I was couples counseling you

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.610
can pay you basically paid to have like

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.860
your baby like it's just all the stuff

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.450
you say yeah if someone else has it I

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.220
went through this today her mom was

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.630
basically just drink water

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.520
she's been like having headaches all

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.750
[ __ ] up and like you don't drink water

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.250
she's like yeah everything doesn't have

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:51.220
to do with water a mom sucks even have

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.680
it be like this but black people don't

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.840
drink enough water it's tough really

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.480
well don't thinking of what inverse it

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.790
tastes sometimes 100% water suppose it's

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.140
not maybe they're not getting the best

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.320
water

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.070
traditionally aren't getting the best

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:15.970
water percentage of a very small

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.670
percentage most of us are crushing water

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:25.120
right decent decent water yeah but you

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.790
get you get told very early on that uh

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.100
I'll be drinking a water exactly

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.570
really why does for nerds in the black

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:35.980
community to be considered a nerd or

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.720
herb or whatever version of that word

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.980
you're trying to avoid in your life

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:44.440
drinking that's me oh you got a house on

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.390
me later still wet later

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:47.980
yeah exact you don't have flavor your

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.080
flavor yeah white people white people

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.730
need seasoning black people got

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:55.150
seasoning down to Dane who that might be

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.130
the problem might be too much might be

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.450
too obsessed with seasoning

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.610
ya know there's there's a in here I

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.559
think this is almost a few girl

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:03.850
fall into this with like everything

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:05.889
needed to be delicious like everything

00:20:05.889 --> 00:20:07.419
has to be the most delicious [ __ ]

00:20:07.419 --> 00:20:09.519
thing you say girls and predominantly

00:20:09.519 --> 00:20:16.659
[ __ ] with it's like I'm like everything

00:20:16.659 --> 00:20:18.129
you eat doesn't have to be delicious

00:20:18.129 --> 00:20:20.620
it's like just get it over a quick thing

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.179
and get it over with and leave but yeah

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:24.340
the Meo is a constant struggle or I'm

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.570
like you don't need a squirt like

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.789
questionable [ __ ] industry water spray

00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:29.409
some cast not supposed to be fun this is

00:20:29.409 --> 00:20:31.659
just maintenance jam it down and go and

00:20:31.659 --> 00:20:33.039
she's like you Walt yeah that's easy for

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:34.299
you to say but she's like I can't just

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:35.889
drink water like that nothing like a

00:20:35.889 --> 00:20:39.009
good flavorless food yeah dude just like

00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:45.340
a Marcia good girl and that's the head

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.320
is a keen insight dude I never got into

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:54.309
the psychology behind it so my wife has

00:20:54.309 --> 00:21:47.110
this theory Housewives of Atlanta must

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:55.960
take you like [ __ ] years to fill like

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.779
trainers with like water bottles we

00:21:58.779 --> 00:22:01.299
stretch them yeah yeah I mean Gatorade

00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:04.029
is like cramp formula that's literally

00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:06.009
why we started Gatorade started to avoid

00:22:06.009 --> 00:22:08.169
cramp Gatorade that's why we called our

00:22:08.169 --> 00:22:08.679
stuff

00:22:08.679 --> 00:22:12.820
Gatorade it was Florida hot the boys

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.060
were getting [ __ ] France

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.620
actually you know when they invented it

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:20.000
by post segregation once black players

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.590
started joining those Florida Gators

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.850
they're like how the [ __ ] we keep these

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.000
boys going you gotta keep them on the

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.570
field

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.930
yeah was it came up with a delicious

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.420
quench it had to be delicious oh they do

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.980
they're the initial stages must have

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.080
been tough dude like bring mama sweet

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:43.070
tea there's like stories in football

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.990
before like catering like before they

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.580
understood hydration at all they'd be

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.710
like I give them whiskey yo yeah they'd

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.450
have like shots on the sidelines like

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.430
all right that you'll play better

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.260
I love how Florida's premier scientist

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.180
was like I figured it out y'all pickle

00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:00.800
juice salt sugar that was like the

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.540
leading [ __ ] science down there

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.760
Gatorade yeah Gatorade was like

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.860
technology did they do the space program

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.160
or is that just you down there I don't

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.140
even know where NASA is where is it it's

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.640
just it's a theory I think you hit it

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.880
yeah Houston I think you say I think

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.680
yeah I don't know but I don't think that

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.090
was like a southern hello it wasn't like

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.770
a breakaway southern you know that was

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.020
where we gonna put this space [ __ ] and

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.090
like yeah it's easier down there yeah

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.250
yeah didn't that wasn't like the south

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:47.750

capitalism war why is that on the same

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.190
level that's what I was trying to figure

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.660
out I'm like alright hopefully this guy

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.910

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.549
to me I'm looking for it it's just a

00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:48.809
thing about him being like me and my

00:24:48.809 --> 00:24:50.399
daughter look at the moon and it's like

00:24:50.399 --> 00:24:52.499
so beautiful and then like I have to

00:24:52.499 --> 00:24:54.480
think about how like we got there but it

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.789
was basically using like Cold War Nazi

00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:59.190
ballistic science and I have to like

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.440
live with that that was a whole article

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.489

moon I mean dude it was just like

00:25:09.239 --> 00:25:10.859
eventually and it looked like eventually

00:25:10.859 --> 00:25:13.769
we're all going to be environmental

00:25:13.769 --> 00:25:15.749
refugees so like we should just get used

00:25:15.749 --> 00:25:18.929
to the dude it made no sense and then do

00:25:18.929 --> 00:25:19.950
the end of it I'm like the article

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:22.799
sucked at the end it says hate racists

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.629
you'll want to read this it's basically

00:25:24.629 --> 00:25:26.940
them being like give us money because

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.710
we're doing a maker racist cry campaign

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.570
so every dollar you give will go

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.039
directly to our ongoing efforts to make

00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:35.489
a racist cry and that there's they don't

00:25:35.489 --> 00:25:36.989
explain how they're going to do that

00:25:36.989 --> 00:25:40.940
it's sending me copies of the movie up

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:44.159
but it's like there's no say on how

00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:46.049
they're doing that dude I'm telling you

00:25:46.049 --> 00:25:47.999

00:25:47.999 --> 00:25:50.730
said this before the I mean you could

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.619
call it white guilt Western civilization

00:25:52.619 --> 00:25:54.690
guilt that's going that is an industry

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.059

about this a comedy did this right just

00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.850
the general way to talk about things

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:02.280
like I'm listening to this book right

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.870
now called the history of human language

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.580
right yeah or the story of human

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.050
language and it talks about how things

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:16.830
get broken down I'm not limited to the

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.840
dimensions of a paper page I'm like way

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.610

hypertext but go on I can't wait I did

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.380
the only thing I care about cybertek I'm

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:41.100
big in the Braille they don't really

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.730
they feel yeah yeah we can find books we

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.260
should have information Lincoln all I

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.760
know I'm making it all up I'm making it

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.790
all up

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.440
[ __ ] I've been laughing since we

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.730
watched so we watched this thing called

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.940
SBS K where this weird weird dude

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.370
interviews kids with like horrific

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.110
disabilities he just sits down to

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.630
YouTube channel SBS K but there's one

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:05.430
where he's interviewing this little

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.930
black kid that's just strapped into a

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.270
[ __ ] thing complete vegetable yeah

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.940
and somebody was like I wonder what he's

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.800
thinking are like what do you think his

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:29.610
like inner monologue is it's everybody

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.610
every I think most people in America's

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:36.660
inner also be like what would you assume

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.040
he was thinking I don't know like about

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.450
physics you can't you can't do the

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.520
Hawking bias on them you can't assume

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.050
he's just thinking physics someone

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.670
strapped up you can't assume they're

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:45.960
just thinking about like he's literally

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.210
hanging it looks like they just strapped

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.680
him to the back of like one of those

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.990
like at like those one of those things

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.559
like for your

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:56.490
and Berger the back of one of these just

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.490
hang in there well it's not it's headed

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:00.299
up to the sky

00:29:00.299 --> 00:29:02.070
it's not the mouth it's North so he's

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.960
just like fully just kind of contained

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.210
only vegetable yeah there's no I mean

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:08.190
it's horrible they interviewed this guy

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.470
is a YouTube you've millions of views we

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.389
just interviews like horribly disabled

00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:15.590
people yeah we talked about on the page

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.779
that didn't listen it'll just be like so

00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:20.100
what kind of things people say to you

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.509
that bother you and they're like I'd

00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:22.620
rather not talk about that right now

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.720
yeah every single one's like mmm it's

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.059
like I thought I was being on TV my

00:29:27.059 --> 00:29:30.570
dream to get away from Misty except for

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.759
the one kid the kid with the boston camo

00:29:32.759 --> 00:29:34.950
hat yeah actually guy he was like 34

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:36.990
he's like this little he's got nagger

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:53.399
miller syndrome yeah at the end he gives

00:29:53.399 --> 00:29:55.409
like the beginning he gives a pound to

00:29:55.409 --> 00:29:57.899
the guy yeah and then he types in his

00:29:57.899 --> 00:29:59.519
board which takes like a minute and it's

00:29:59.519 --> 00:30:02.759
like two [ __ ] brothers and legends

00:30:02.759 --> 00:30:09.179
unite writing [ __ ] the episode

00:30:09.179 --> 00:30:11.129
descriptions these two brothers in

00:30:11.129 --> 00:30:13.230
legends unite he was already cooler than

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.860
the guy conduct anyway so just I love

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.899
imagining any [ __ ] person's inner

00:30:18.899 --> 00:30:20.519
monologue being like god damn these

00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:29.340
[ __ ] I pray to God I don't get

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.169
why they hooked him up to like some sort

00:30:31.169 --> 00:30:43.470
of like like sh e what's the worst part

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:47.230
of being in this thing minute goes by

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:52.740
[Laughter]

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.519
there's another H there's another age is

00:31:02.519 --> 00:31:04.049
another there's watching like a

00:31:04.049 --> 00:31:05.290
seismograph

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.530
H e e what's he see he's trying to

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.420
commuting we bring in a cultural expert

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.400
he's like Samuel Jackson comes in he's

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:20.560
like he's saying guys are looking at

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.820
this wrong he spelling they're like

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:27.120
she'd he's trying to give us his pronoun

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.960
listening so the story of human language

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.460
and it talks about how how language

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:39.790
evolves over time right so one of the

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:43.570
examples it gives the word alone that

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.550
word doesn't really exist anywhere it's

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.930
not it's not broken down from any word

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:49.660
it didn't come from a historical word

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.640
like the word loan comes from a loan

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.650
which even exists less right yeah so

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.500
well came from is two phrasal one that's

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.940
how people used to describe being all

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.100
alone if they would say all one and over

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:04.600
time it became alone yeah like words

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.720
merge consonants drop off like those get

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.300
soft and that's how language basically

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.670
develops over time so the same thing

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.290
happens with perception so we had this

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:16.030
this thing where we would we would joke

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:18.250
about how a mr. tell me how comedy is

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.360
responsible for what's happening right

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.720
now yeah so we would joke about how

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.640
white people should feel guilty about

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.350
things and was like a funny joke but you

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:30.760
I suppose actually believe that so when

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.740
you hear that more and more the next

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.240
generation gets to take that a step

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.730
further so we here we joke around about

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:41.040
it they hear it and they're like okay

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.270
not let's do something about I think it

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.310
takes viewers lost they get the humors

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:48.250
lost and now it's it's like a trope it's

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.110
just a common thing that people know why

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:51.760
people should feel guilty or why people

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.670
are evil you know and then when you can

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.350
easily just say that without

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.600
consequences in your own ethics and

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.760
morals to say white people are evil and

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.410
not question that would you just thought

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:03.280
yeah

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.860
then we're here yes you know yeah I saw

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.140
a tweet today it's kind of its kind of

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.730
on it's not really there but it's like

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.880
there's lady tweeted out like just a PSA

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.620
remember black people can't be racist

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:18.850
and I was just like I just imagined

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:23.110
everybody like a 7-eleven like come on

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:26.039
[ __ ] yeah dot head [ __ ]

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:28.090
remember little kids were coming in the

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.769
one corner store and be like what's up

00:33:29.769 --> 00:33:33.940
Osama looking mother and that's the

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.799
funny thing about it too is everybody's

00:33:35.799 --> 00:33:38.529
complaining about Trump that send her

00:33:38.529 --> 00:33:40.090
back send them back to their own country

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.100
tweet and people are out there saying I

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.840
think people say no black teenagers are

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:50.789
out there saying how aspect of China

00:33:53.429 --> 00:33:56.980
yeah that's uh also to people just

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.019
becoming like uncomfortably aware of

00:33:59.019 --> 00:34:01.330
everything like that would that was like

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.149
never the there was there was always

00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:05.950
like don't be mean don't be racist and

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:09.190
now there's like by your existence you

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:11.139
are like a sheer oppressive force so be

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:16.419
mindful of that it's like okay [ __ ]

00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:17.859
rock with that yeah I mean I also

00:34:17.859 --> 00:34:19.179
imagine the other side of that where

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:20.440
it's like by your existence you are a

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.319
complete victim yeah Jesus Christ

00:34:23.319 --> 00:34:25.899
it sucks yeah it is the weirdest thing

00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:28.270
to like be a father

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.819
yeah yeah you know what I mean i how do

00:34:30.819 --> 00:34:33.790
i how do I tell my son to like well mom

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.560
I said hello tell my daughters yeah my

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.030
son has white skin yeah your honky

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:42.129
deathlike I mean you remember like that

00:34:42.129 --> 00:34:43.149
was one of the things that kind of

00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:44.649
flipped me even harder like holy [ __ ]

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:46.599
let's pump the brakes here yeah because

00:34:46.599 --> 00:34:49.359
you're gonna look at my son and just

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:52.240
automatically call him an oppressor yeah

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.220
you know and it's like he doesn't have

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.220
oppressor lineage technically yeah you

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.170
know like Ansley's family they were poor

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:10.420
you know and then was like well yeah my

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.460
family did own slaves which yeah it was

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.690
basically I think someone's saying like

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:14.859
you know how we gonna rectify that he's

00:35:14.859 --> 00:35:16.780
like well there's a generations of

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.790
spread quite a bit I don't see this is

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.500
why I should be president because I know

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.480
directly what slavery can do and so yeah

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.940
make you rich and be the [ __ ] out of

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.880
every politician had them oh yeah Omar

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.010
had him she had some Somalis stop

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:32.310
believe me you think so come on bro

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:38.070
what come on brother that what you're

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.320
saying makes sense because it's like if

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.330
my kid will be half black so am I like

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.390
if my kids like having a problem as his

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.910
father do I have to be like I have some

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:49.530
points to make when I got to stand down

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.180
and respect your experience right now

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.920
because I just don't understand oh you

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.720
got a stand the [ __ ] that's crazy it's

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.300
like it'd be like well I don't I can't

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.740
speak on this right now come on you

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.060
can't give any fatherly advice

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.580
yes your son's gonna be raised in the

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.080
house with two parents by a single

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.780
mother but you can't say anything you

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.910
can't help I could yeah technically I

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.350
would have been sit back and while I go

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.150
to the grocery store yeah you know

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:15.210
supply rations basically like nothing no

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:15.990
heart-to-hearts

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.820
yeah if I were to be like listen son

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.560
yeah you could teach him the cross or

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.620
some [ __ ] actually that'll be a sick

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.210
tactic if he's just like oh I'm excuse

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:28.560
me Dad I'm like [ __ ] yeah oh yeah that

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.000
is a weird all that stuff breaks down

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.910
when you start getting into like buy

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.730
reishi allottee and it's like oh no then

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.200

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.010
uh ya know Bama yeah Morocco BAM Obama

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:42.600
he's never been oppressed a day in his

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.160
life

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:49.560
that's a CIA family that's the - dude we

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.270

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:53.490
he'll our new [ __ ] queen there was

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:56.100
that lady Sheree Murray no absolute

00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:00.660
Queen she's what she came out with the

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.300
[ __ ] fire tweet this was like last

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.470
week

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.720
Sheree Murray tweeted there's a crisis

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.270
in Queens and it's called AOC she isn't

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.440
worried about us she's worried about

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.240
being famous that's why I'm running for

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.790
Congress join our movement oh damn

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:18.060
what's he doing now how is she fitting

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.620
in amongst the media narrative and like

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.170
the persecution of the squad I feel like

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.740
right now she's a known strange space

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.790
squad's under fire right now

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.890
Wow dude she's conservative she's a

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:30.360
Republican she's a Republican I love

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.470
this country it's been a land of

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.780
opportunity for me and my family we must

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.190
get back to positive dialogue in

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.660
solutions a or C and the radical left

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.270
want to divide us oh god bless the gonna

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:40.530
build bridges instead of burning them

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:41.910
down goddamn

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.740
history Murray dude well that's color

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.940
white she's committing what's called

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.970
colorblind racism

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:48.280
so if you're in this context and you're

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.230
like yeah there's some [ __ ] that's

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:51.730
obviously gone down well that's like

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.980
kind of focus on like our similarities

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.780
and try to build like mutuality and

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.760
people like huh easy for you to say

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.020
because you're white and you're

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.580
committing colorblind racism which was

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.680
just as bad it's like what what should i

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.220
do then

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.349
I can't be regular right it's like your

00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:08.680
options are like regular racism far left

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.109
like as a white person it's time to

00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:12.520
remove it and then the middle ground is

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.170
just demonized it being like right we're

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:15.460
all human beings let's [ __ ] try to

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.530
establish some sort of normalcy here and

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:18.820
not be weird around each other it's like

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:22.060
oh yeah easy for you to say I'm just

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.310
looking at Twitter she tweeted thank you

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.619
Donald Trump about his he said just had

00:38:26.619 --> 00:38:27.940
a very good call with Swedish prime

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:29.920
minister who assured me that American

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.720
citizen ASAP rocky will be treated

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.849
fairly likewise I assured him that ASAP

00:38:33.849 --> 00:38:35.770
was not a flight risk and offered to

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:37.840
personally vouch for his bail I saw that

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.290
yes Trump dogs putting up bail for ASAP

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:43.090
what a world see I get into it where I'm

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.390
like I think 90% of the stuff staged and

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.830
there was just a salve Rock he was just

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.900
like or maybe you did get arrested and

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.250
they're like perfect perfectly you've

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:54.630
got a sense of you thought he was in on

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:57.730
come on for enough money or he got a rep

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.140
but it's imagine like you're a rapper

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.460
you got arrested now you hear a bunch of

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.020
politicians are trying to spring you and

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.599
you're like what obviously it looks

00:39:04.599 --> 00:39:05.170
great

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.900
they said rocky like he took a break

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.460
he's like my favorite rapper woods now

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.050
he's good but it's funny to think of

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.580
like Trump's doing his thing which at

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.260
whatever you people think it is but it's

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.630
like say he's Aries like making the

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.420
tough he's like basically like not

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.130
granting asylum for people in Central

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.930
America and then he's like President

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:25.780
ASAP Rocky's in jail he's like what get

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:32.740
him out bring him back yeah also no one

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.380
no one on earth believes that this is a

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:41.530
genuine hilarious it is funny it is very

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.810
it's a funny that someone was like put

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:45.130
up his [ __ ] bail dude people think

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.859
you're cool as [ __ ] yeah but he I think

00:39:47.859 --> 00:39:50.170
he is everything I have to say something

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.380
so I think he enjoys doing these types

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.599
of things because we're lazy liberals

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:57.849
can't say that's true a thing about or

00:39:57.849 --> 00:39:59.349
sure you know he's strong you're saying

00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.710
he's

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.450
with that with the sanctuary cities

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:02.650
rather than fighting them he was a guy

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:02.920
right

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.630
and he started directing like tons of

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:07.000
immigrants to them that's like puts you

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:07.780
in a tough spot

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.220
that's my thing with immigration it's

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:12.280
like I have like I have no beef with

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.490
immigrants as like seeing them but if to

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:18.010
be like I think it's cool if it was up

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:19.690
to me we wouldn't have like borders in a

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:21.250
country but that's why I'm not in charge

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.660
because that would probably spell

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.580
disaster some you know what I'm saying

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.560
like I don't like it just because I I'm

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.970
like yeah dude [ __ ] it let's get rid of

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.190
them that's as far as my get rid of

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:32.290
borders and countries that's as far as

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.720
my brain takes it I imagine there's like

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.609
its consequence beyond that that I'm too

00:40:36.609 --> 00:40:40.030
dumb to understand no borders yeah crazy

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.040
consequences total borderless just like

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.450
I think you could understand some of

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:45.880
this guy yeah like okay now our

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.160
government like how do you decide who's

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.900
making the rules well that's what I'm

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.460
saying so it's like when you're if

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.320
you're like look man I have no problem

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.619
with immigrants it's just if you totally

00:40:56.619 --> 00:40:59.589
just like let everyone come in that

00:40:59.589 --> 00:41:02.470
might spell a very like practical

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.180
problem you know what I mean and to

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.420
bring that up they're like racist no no

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.119
like some Ukrainians Italy shoot their

00:41:10.119 --> 00:41:14.710
guns that we thumb the Eagles go against

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.020
my nature being like well we should

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.150
probably have some sort of like having

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.859
some sort of countries and boundary it

00:41:20.859 --> 00:41:22.420
bothers me that I need a passport I'm

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.650
like I can't just [ __ ] fly in this

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.450
place this is annoying oh yeah Americans

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:27.250
should be able to go anywhere they used

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.359
to be able to but then a lot of

00:41:28.359 --> 00:41:30.099
countries started being like Brazil did

00:41:30.099 --> 00:41:31.570
it Brazil was just like oh you made us

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.190
get [ __ ] now this is you have to give

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.930
visas and only we feel like I'm being

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:36.510
nationalists about that I just feel like

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:38.230
true we're good

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:40.950
yeah we're not gonna yeah yeah you are

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:43.450
pretty cool what I mean like what yet

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.099
how many how many incidents have there

00:41:45.099 --> 00:41:46.780
been of Americans like flying to another

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:50.910
country and it's like [ __ ] it up

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.580
true but although the guys to go under

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:06.460
the guise of Bergdahl yeah no you're

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.530
right that is a totally those guys are

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:09.940
coming here on vacation like hey we're

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.860
CIA

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.050
at customs fair point and this is why I

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.430
shouldn't be establishing like

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.380
immigration or power tools like wait a

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:20.080
second I got coming here on vacation

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.940
some guy wasn't just like there wasn't

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.470
just like I know suits listen a Beach

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:26.380
2020 gentleman on the flight 97 it's

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:30.640
like they're like okay this is wrong

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.620
good don't say yeah you're right

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.760
that's one three ninety three there's no

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.190
yeah they're like look at these [ __ ]

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.840
fields in central Pennsylvania

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.180
these fields [ __ ] this [ __ ] do you think

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.040
that's what they were targeting just

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.970
feels they haven't seen grass before how

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.410
I flying over and Ike what the [ __ ] is

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:55.120
that what's going on abomination yeah

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.640
that's that's my thing it's like dude we

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.930
can't just come I can't be able to come

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:00.700
up with the same immigration policy just

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.980
to be like look it's like obviously you

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.540
can't like when they're like because the

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.770
way they presented is like there's

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:07.240
people coming here who need to get in

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.730
here we can't do anything it's like

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.870
again that's a slippery slope dude

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.460
there's [ __ ] billions of people in

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.350
like just utter starvation so if we're

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:17.020
like hey everybody let's go if we could

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.640
do that awesome I do that just don't

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.050
think that's possible right now we I

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.900
mean you you if you would except people

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.790
would appeal to their better nature sure

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.530
well yeah that's what it is it appeal to

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:27.670
the better nature yeah but that's not

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:29.260
what people saying your better nature

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.210
does not necessarily comprehend

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.610
comprehend reality but even even like

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:34.990
directly you're like you're you're

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:37.540
you're mild you're mildly okay nature

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.730
right so I mean of course I was joking

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:41.170
around I don't think Americans should be

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:42.190
able to go anywhere they want to

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:45.340
although we should but but you can't

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.630
have that because then you'd have people

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.850
in China like just doing all sorts of

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:50.380
disrespectful [ __ ] because Americans can

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.580
go anywhere they'll have that attitude

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.500
they'll be mad yeah yeah it's me walking

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:59.410
in place up two shoes on and I wonder if

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.970
that is like Asian rebellion like you

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.830
keep the [ __ ] BK Knight strapped up

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.710
don't go to the parents house hell yeah

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:07.690
although I think there's like you would

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:09.130
catch them it would probably turn into

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:12.010
like like a Kill Bill scene of like jam

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.420
boobers like if they're hitting me with

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.730
like a disciplinary bamboo as a kid you

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:17.230
pull it up and you start post effin

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:19.450
probably too many martial arts skills

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:21.160
people for their own good over there I

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.110
mean if you're beating your imaginary

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:24.670
dad was just like beating you but it was

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:25.190
like a

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:31.640
and punches of death of udders kids have

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:41.030
been karate chops by their pastor for

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.280
nine seconds

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.329
what if there's any like poison like

00:44:44.329 --> 00:44:47.210
like mildly poisoned darts you're just

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:50.349
like [ __ ] around your brothers your

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.150
that's what early discipline was for

00:44:53.150 --> 00:45:01.310
Asian Tony that's what that's what some

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:03.109
comedians talk about that yeah white

00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:04.220
people don't know about that Asian

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:05.630
parents like beat us up pretty bad but

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:07.880
it's like Asian dad's probably [ __ ]

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.150
their kids oh yeah yeah you carry those

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:16.760
in the house flip-flops yeah dude I'm

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.410
wondering ever explored that like the

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.750
the link of like like when Miyagi

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.099
strokes his beard that must have been

00:45:22.099 --> 00:45:23.810
like a lot of Asian American kids are

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:25.940
probably like a little bit yeah yeah

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.319
we're in the Kill Bill when he throws

00:45:27.319 --> 00:45:29.450
his [ __ ] beard to the side imagine

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:30.710
that your dad sitting there he's [ __ ]

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:35.569
strokes is super long goatee bring home

00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:41.630
that a - duty basically because the

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:42.859
beatings you would need to be beat for a

00:45:42.859 --> 00:45:46.460
lot more yeah I mean a lot of like Asian

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.290
Americans a lot of Eastern Americans say

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:49.940
say they get like disciplined like ace

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.410
the whole thing is that like their

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:53.030
parents don't except us

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.500
yeah they got a B+ are in serious

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.390
trouble and they're also saying they get

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:58.520
beat a lot so I was like are you getting

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.130
beat for a b-plus I donno it's an

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:02.500
interesting thing because I do feel like

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:06.109
China dads are definitely docile he

00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:08.240
thinks that hostile men so but yeah

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.859
you're but there's Tallis and there's

00:46:09.859 --> 00:46:12.920
Confucianists true that's that's true

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.069
two-fifty about a 50/50 split true so I

00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:17.599
think your dad's a Tallis he would just

00:46:17.599 --> 00:46:18.710
kind of go to the top of the mountain

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:22.240
you wouldn't see him for like 65 years

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:26.380
like what is a pack of cigarettes

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.849
outside yeah I was thinking who don't

00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:31.540
love his family

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:35.309
[Music]

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:38.460
it's it iliyan Omar like anybody that

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.810
like sneaks into the country illegally

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:42.540
or like I don't know if I don't have any

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:43.950
borders I want to get to but like if

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:45.870
they were like you can never go to a

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:49.080
Notre Dame game the only way you can get

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.940
in that Stadium as if you marry your

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.000
sister you would do it I gotta do

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:54.510
something

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.250
yeah but then which again we I got to

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:58.290
find out she had kids or not and at this

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.060
point I don't know honestly you like at

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.790
a gut level am I really like I mean

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:04.320
that's kind of problematic there like

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.840
she had kids I'm like okay but I wasn't

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.010
like blown out of the water

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:09.900
sneaking into the country and getting

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.000
away with it it's pretty American I [ __ ]

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.240
with that yeah you get in long enough to

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.620
become a [ __ ] US congressman she made

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.240
it better or at that point we have to

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.800
okay you got us yeah I think we should

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.450
have like strict boundaries but if you

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.580
get past them you're in it were like

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.470
nice definitely good job

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:29.730
they're pretty much that's kind of the

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.890
rule to that is rule like most people

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:33.300
are just like once you get in it's like

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.530
what do you want to be dreamers dude

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:37.170
that's true if you have you know if you

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:38.880
have a child he's in that's kind of the

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.560
rule if you get in people are like

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:43.290
alright nice it's kind of a it's like

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:44.730
survival of the fittest I think what

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:47.040
what better way do you make sure you're

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.900
getting the best from the country is say

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.610
well we'll set up a really difficult

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:55.530
obstacle course well apparently we like

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:57.900
50% of the immigrants come like flying

00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.370
in and going like working like

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:01.830
specialized fields okay it might even be

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:03.600
like 60 or 70 it's like a large portion

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.360
come in from like Asia India other

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.680
countries and like going like the

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.480
medical field but then if you haven't

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.280
people come up from Central America a

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.990
lot of times not all the times a lot of

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:15.840
times are kind of like lacking

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.790
educational skills you do want to make

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:19.680
some like rugged physical obstacle

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.970
courses to ensure that when they get

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:21.390
here

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:23.700
you know yeah they're gonna be able to

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.620
work we're not just getting lazy lads

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.170

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:30.750

like must be a chill ass town it must be

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.270

let's just kill these going through the

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:58.070
process of talking this out yeah that's

00:48:58.070 --> 00:48:59.660
that's so weird to me that's like a

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.190
thing where it's like Oh what you don't

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:02.900

education behind front everyone pushing

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.390

even an activity no one never talks

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:17.420

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:43.670
beards now are different beards now are

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:45.799
like yeah but there is that like I was

00:58:45.799 --> 00:58:47.299
you know if you're in Fishtown and go

00:58:47.299 --> 00:58:50.299
through there it's just like stop well

00:58:50.299 --> 00:58:53.029
nobody's short shorts with a beard well

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:54.980
people failed and I watched this from

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:57.109
way on there was in high school there

00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:59.749
was kids that were like in the emo scene

00:58:59.749 --> 00:59:02.450
and then I watched them all all the kids

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:04.160
I knew who like bought into like the

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.200
apparel associated with being like in

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:09.230
the emo scene I watched them all switch

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:11.029
as they got a little older into the

00:59:11.029 --> 00:59:12.920
hipster scene oh yeah that's something

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.269
no one ever talked about this is just a

00:59:14.269 --> 00:59:16.609
person just slowly buying into every

00:59:16.609 --> 00:59:18.650
single fad that emerged absolutely so

00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:20.569
it's like you know and now in times

00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:22.309
exactly so it's like but the either was

00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:25.460
the emo to hipster switch what you know

00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:26.839
I hate talking in these kind of terms

00:59:26.839 --> 00:59:28.190
but it was just like I remember being

00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:29.509
like kids that were these weird

00:59:29.509 --> 00:59:31.009
rubberband looking bracelets and had

00:59:31.009 --> 00:59:33.170
like punky looked buttons on their

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:35.509
schoolbags traded it in for like just a

00:59:35.509 --> 00:59:37.190
new set of game or watching kids I

00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:38.450
haven't seen for years I'd see him again

00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:40.369
they'd just be dressed in the way of

00:59:40.369 --> 00:59:42.230
like what I was like yeah I remember

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:43.730
when hipsters were coming around I was

00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:45.739
like why is everyone dressing like this

00:59:45.739 --> 00:59:46.999
I didn't understand what it was and like

00:59:46.999 --> 00:59:49.239
it became a thing you could say and now

00:59:49.239 --> 00:59:51.619
you know it's norm and now hipsters kind

00:59:51.619 --> 00:59:53.190
of evolved in the man

00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:55.680
again tough guy with a beard yeah and a

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.329
tattooed sleeve and like but like

00:59:57.329 --> 00:59:58.920
conscious and aware of the fact that

00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.329
their masculinity could pose a problem

01:00:00.329 --> 01:00:02.609
so like they have to all very yeah it's

01:00:02.609 --> 01:00:04.890
really weird yeah they do that question

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:06.780
talk that the women did all the year the

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.310
NPR I was like I'm not trying to be

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:13.079
offensive you just did yeah yeah that's

01:00:13.079 --> 01:00:14.490
weird that's a weird thing nobody ever

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:15.960
talked about how they just all switch

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:21.390
they talk and that and so I get to like

01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:23.250
I'm around all these I'm a stay-at-home

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:24.690
dad I'm with my kids during the day so I

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:27.569
go to do these things and it's like

01:00:27.569 --> 01:00:29.430
trying to by the way I keep bringing up

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:32.540
your podcast to see if they're cool yeah

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:37.170
oh and I did [ __ ] in roomers name I did

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:39.510
bump into one guy that did listen to

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:41.579
your podcast reminds me I got a shout

01:00:41.579 --> 01:00:44.790
out a carpi and booty dude the Bulls

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:47.130
something late I was on I was walking to

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:48.839
my car today this guy he pulled over I

01:00:48.839 --> 01:00:50.819
was like he heard his window down was

01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:52.260
like look at this [ __ ] shirt dude

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.180
look at this shirt he was wearing a man

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:59.190
change shirt yeah dogs so you're saying

01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:01.619
you see dads getting there they're just

01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:03.869
like how are they hanging out with the

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:06.200
so what they do is they try they try to

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.339
not really I don't want say relate to

01:01:08.339 --> 01:01:10.200
the women but they try to make it seem

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.310
like oh yeah we're like moms too well

01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:16.260
yeah cause being Abby knows mom is

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.750
powerful exactly so now men are like I'm

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:21.869
you know I'm that said you can't you

01:01:21.869 --> 01:01:23.910
also can parent your child as a father

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:25.980
right yeah but it's like they're trying

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:29.640
to parent their kids as male moms whoa

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.069
it's really is that because it like I

01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:33.329
don't understand it are they like do you

01:01:33.329 --> 01:01:34.619
think these guys are jammed up about the

01:01:34.619 --> 01:01:35.730
fact that they're staying home and

01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:38.460
they're not like bread winner don't

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:41.130
pause because nobody nobody really knows

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.930
what anything means right so you have

01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:46.140
little boys who are naturally like

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.150
aggressive they want to jump on things

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:50.369
climb on things yeah be aggressive bump

01:01:50.369 --> 01:01:51.599
into each other throw each other down

01:01:51.599 --> 01:01:54.000
and stuff and that is a great release

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.800
for little boys yeah they go do that

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.599
like little girls they go in a corner

01:01:57.599 --> 01:01:58.859
and talk [ __ ] about each other even

01:01:58.859 --> 01:02:00.329
better really early ages yeah

01:02:00.329 --> 01:02:02.190
isolating this a good release for little

01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:05.160
girls you've wanted yes like my like at

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.410
three four years old

01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:08.780
that already happens they'll get in

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:11.089
little groups and they'll be like well

01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:13.369
these girls like this toy and these

01:02:13.369 --> 01:02:15.020
girls like this and it's like they start

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:19.250
separating people know they really early

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:21.619
on you see girls they like name their

01:02:21.619 --> 01:02:22.250
group

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:24.710
yeah I've said this before I think the

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:27.109
female he goes aggression is rooted in

01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:29.780
exclusivity 100% of its that's the

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:31.910
female aggressive move is to like find

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:33.710
someone and exclude them and they play

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:35.420
with it because this is this is

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:36.589
something they're gonna be using for the

01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:38.059
rest of their life so they have to learn

01:02:38.059 --> 01:02:41.780
how to use it as them so because each

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.160
person doesn't get to use it the same

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.410
way like the fat tall girl doesn't get

01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:48.260
to use it the same way the petite pretty

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:49.910
girl you're exclusionary powers are

01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:52.490
limited different well they have to use

01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:54.980
different tactics right so they could

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.990
probably reach the same heights of power

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:59.180
but the methodology behind them are

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.569
gonna be vastly different yeah dude tell

01:03:02.569 --> 01:03:04.190
my little girls excluding each other on

01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:29.839
the head when you said that I know I did

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:30.890
notice when you're telling that story

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:32.750
I'm like you don't when people hate you

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:35.029
with fat it [ __ ] pisses you off well

01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:36.470
alright

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:38.569
it's tough to show vulnerability on here

01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:44.990
but yeah it's just a thing where it's

01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:47.150
like if you're saying that like it's any

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:48.799
any it doesn't hurt my feelings yeah it

01:03:48.799 --> 01:03:50.390
hurts my feelings to know someone thinks

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:52.160
they're hurting me that's when it

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.140
bothers do it then like if you call me

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.869
that yeah if I I would come I thought I

01:03:56.869 --> 01:03:58.819
was genuinely bring down the hammer yeah

01:03:58.819 --> 01:04:03.859
yeah I'm not going to I was very good to

01:04:03.859 --> 01:04:06.410
you I've lingering fat insecurities yeah

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.839
but yeah I got teased viciously for

01:04:08.839 --> 01:04:11.210
being fat but they didn't really like I

01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:13.849
don't know yeah I just used it to my my

01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:15.829
powers yeah I just wrote a man elite

01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:17.960
offensive lineman weird literally just

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.910
talking about how he was saying watching

01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:20.180
young

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:22.339
girls and how all their power is kind of

01:04:22.339 --> 01:04:23.599
like any isolated from the patent

01:04:23.599 --> 01:04:26.809
podcasts being being [ __ ] but except

01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:28.220
within intergroup between them it's

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:31.010
being like exclusive like women are

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:33.200
aggressive through exclusion of others

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.819
mmm so like they'll cut they'll be like

01:04:34.819 --> 01:04:36.260
not invite someone someone he was saying

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:38.619
he's watching like three-year-olds like

01:04:38.619 --> 01:04:41.000
click up and like push people out like

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.319
we like this and like kind of like

01:04:42.319 --> 01:04:44.300
edging people out yeah like like

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.050
preference of toys or like colors yeah

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.780
they can find different we're this llll

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.099
girls watching them do that different ya

01:04:52.099 --> 01:04:54.589
know and when men do men do that now and

01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:57.290
it's a real feminine [ __ ] move like I

01:04:57.290 --> 01:04:59.000
you seen like like when clicks like

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.460
especially in comedy yeah somebody will

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:02.750
walk over to a table and like we don't

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:06.200
talk to them what man just get dumped I

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.960
see I think that was older okay I think

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.270
that was an old thing only place but yes

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:14.869
so far would man another Philly comic he

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:17.390
had they had to break up because the

01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:19.099
other comic was like I can't hang out

01:05:19.099 --> 01:05:20.329

if they're like going over there and

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:53.960
directly doing with the boys

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.339

trying to impress Shane and like you

01:05:57.049 --> 01:05:58.190

no look it's like you're not you're not

01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:04.369
doing that for your kid because you're

01:06:04.369 --> 01:06:06.920
that's bad which normal kid and you're

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.750
teaching him to like acquiesce to

01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:10.960
strangers for no reason at all

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.069
kids pick up here's a really perceptive

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:16.910
- yes very perceptive and in you know I

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:19.040
think because I was I was super

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.869
perceptive kid and I grew up with a mom

01:06:20.869 --> 01:06:22.670
who was like on drugs and [ __ ] so you

01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:25.130
you're hyper aware of the fact that

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:28.280
you're hyper aware yeah more stuff to be

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.809
aware so like one of the things as a

01:06:29.809 --> 01:06:31.280
parent I was always making sure I'd

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.720
never convince myself

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.910
the kid doesn't understand what's going

01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:37.460
on because they have to they meet like

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:40.190
little babies are more tuned in to like

01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:44.210
social cues than us because that's their

01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:46.160
only method of communication in survival

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.869
at the time so they're learning they're

01:06:47.869 --> 01:06:49.309
picking up really quickly like happy

01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:51.980

01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:33.920
level of like context and it's like

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.579

these women outside of the the social

01:08:25.489 --> 01:08:26.989

I'm just like looking at them like do

01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:40.000
you see how hard I stuck to my tell me

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.929
I've learned something really

01:12:41.929 --> 01:12:43.699
interesting so after doing jujitsu and

01:12:43.699 --> 01:12:45.889
watching women in you know like sports

01:12:45.889 --> 01:12:48.020
bras like tiny shorts grappling each

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:50.750
other I know nothing that doesn't

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:52.070
seriously it does nothing fun when

01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:53.449
they're trying to kill each other but

01:12:53.449 --> 01:12:56.060
like any time women are in unison or

01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:06.409
cooperating it's sexy so let me I'm

01:13:06.409 --> 01:13:11.510
saying he's allowed to be sexist so like

01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:12.830
you know when

01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:15.170
all doing the same like wearing wearing

01:13:15.170 --> 01:13:16.520
tiny clothes you're like walking

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.200
sporadically or like being caddy to each

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.880
other nothing yeah but if they're

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.140
wearing tiny clothes all doing the same

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.750
moves at the same time it's kind of nice

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:30.790
talking about cheerleading bro yes

01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:32.930
that's a good point because there's

01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:34.730
cheerleading for some reason is like

01:13:34.730 --> 01:13:35.960
it's one of those things like

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.530
cheerleader yeah you kind of pre come

01:13:39.530 --> 01:13:41.450
whenever a cheerleader you like but

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:43.160
here's the deal when they're not doing

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.750
their routines and they're just like

like go half and half but like I gotta

01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:10.640
try to kill this [ __ ] I don't like

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.740
rolling with women I don't like that

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.960
yeah you know men and women shouldn't be

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.420
doing just each other yeah what are your

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:20.180
thoughts huh again I only I only roll

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.860
with the type of women that have the

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.950
skill to kill me so I'm okay with it

01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:26.610
because I'm trying to survive go entire

01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:29.909
yeah but I have a friend that was at a

01:15:29.909 --> 01:15:32.400
gym in Pittsburgh and she was said she

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.139
was wrong with somebody and they clearly

01:15:34.139 --> 01:15:41.610
had a boner yeah that's that's

01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:44.159
definitely you get away from that that's

01:15:44.159 --> 01:15:46.889
what I get out of a rape get a boner tap

01:15:46.889 --> 01:15:49.679
you can begin tap out no I think if like

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:51.510
her rapist is like into jujitsu he's

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:52.110
like all right

01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:54.389
you think you'd respect oh yeah I don't

01:15:54.389 --> 01:15:56.610
know is that how many rapists jujitsu is

01:15:56.610 --> 01:15:58.619
are there they get discovered pretty

01:15:58.619 --> 01:15:59.429
quickly

01:15:59.429 --> 01:16:01.880
I think jujitsu is a form of ahsoka

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.889
arena jujitsu getting into jujitsu would

01:16:04.889 --> 01:16:07.139
be be pretty crazy little bit of

01:16:07.139 --> 01:16:09.360
overkill in terms of skill it's like you

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.409
know I think it's like the exact skill

01:16:12.409 --> 01:16:14.850
it's also for women the exact skill you

01:16:14.850 --> 01:16:16.380
need to not get raped oh yeah every

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.119

01:16:18.119 --> 01:16:20.460
skills yeah every woman should have you

01:18:16.530 --> 01:18:17.999
just think in them in a way only if

01:18:17.999 --> 01:18:19.619
they're bothering me in some sort of way

01:18:19.619 --> 01:18:21.599

01:18:21.599 --> 01:18:22.920
make that their automatic thing and if

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.499
you people can break out of those little

01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:26.940
molds it's like it's a ripple effect or

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.469
then it starts rippling out so yeah I

01:18:28.469 --> 01:18:30.059

01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:02.350
not trying to stereotype anybody please

01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:04.390

01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:09.280
looking at you to go squash it well I

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.800
mean I as soon as they settled right in

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.100
my area I just walked right over to them

01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:16.420
they were they were they were ramping up

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:18.340
but it didn't just so we got there to

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.450
the park and they were already hanging

01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:21.310
out and we were already cramping her

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:24.340
style because they had like some it was

01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:25.810
a some black boys some black chicks in

01:21:25.810 --> 01:21:27.640
like that two or three fat white chicks

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.530
at the head you know they were sworn in

01:21:29.530 --> 01:21:32.500
yeah they were trying to do all the

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:36.460
stereotype so we got there we kind of

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:38.950
disrupted that and the top squad to

01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:43.570
break up not really because so young

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:46.330
white chicks see parental authority and

01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:47.940
they start to acquiesce immediately

01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:51.490
young black boys see Authority and they

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:54.730
start ramping up yeah so the more they

01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:56.080
ramped up to

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.640
parental authority the more the white

01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.500
girls like this doesn't feel right you

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.120
know but then they want to keep their

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.520
fat White's in check so and then why the

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.170
whites get disturbed they're like

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:08.260
chill so couple girls a couple of black

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:11.080

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:17.230
out of here let's get out here so that

01:22:17.230 --> 01:22:20.590
the alpha the Alpha [ __ ] was like yo

01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:23.469
let's go roll up and they walked to the

01:22:23.469 --> 01:22:24.940
dugout which was away from where we were

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.500
it was a baseball field at the park we

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.660
go to and they rolled up and I was like

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.310
as long as he's staying there we're cool

01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:34.270
yeah they walked back out to cross where

01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:35.410
we were on the playground to go to the

01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:36.730
basketball court but they all walk

01:22:36.730 --> 01:22:38.580
through the playground like pass to me

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:42.280
like in an Z my wife is just playing

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.870
with the kids like Jack that's [ __ ]

01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:47.170
completely care she just she walks

01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:48.550
around with this mentality is like I

01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:50.830
don't care cuz if it goes down I'll [ __ ]

01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:53.500
[ __ ] up you know so me I'm like always

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:55.300
like this happening is this happening so

01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:57.010
they walked past me how old are they I

01:22:57.010 --> 01:23:01.590
would say like 14 - late 1780s you know

01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:03.850
like I was saying to anslee's like I

01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:05.500
guarantee you they're not in school and

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.880
should be and all of them have learning

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:09.340
disabilities they were like those black

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:11.290
with that like the S posture but they're

01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:14.800
always Jackie they don't work out way in

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:17.440
their back [ __ ] really there's no

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:24.300
shirt on yeah it was wearing like a

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:27.250
tight wife beater but with the holes cut

01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:27.880

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.219
he was like wearing no shirt you know

01:23:30.219 --> 01:23:33.730

01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:41.199
a dog and they they weren't wearing him

01:23:41.199 --> 01:23:43.870

01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:46.630
with do-rags on but they weren't so they

01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:48.880
go light up when and then he come back

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:51.550
to the playground and stop right where

01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:54.670

01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:56.949

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:09.460
benches do all the other [ __ ] parents

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:12.219
they got distance enough from the

01:24:12.219 --> 01:24:13.870
situation so that they couldn't hear or

01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:15.760
smell what was happening but left their

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.770

worldstar video waiting to happen

01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:50.020

01:25:04.990 --> 01:25:06.940
soon as they like as soon as they sat

01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:10.030

be their dad yeah and as soon as I said

01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:25.860

he went and put the blonde out and then

01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:30.070
they walked back to the basketball court

01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:32.470

what's it I know you're not that brave

01:27:47.739 --> 01:27:49.020
as a passenger in the car what happened

01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:52.690
what uh Shane made me give up a spot to

01:27:52.690 --> 01:27:55.660

01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:58.989
Philly I don't drive like a con no no

01:27:58.989 --> 01:28:01.060
we're coming into Philly and knows his

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.140
parking spot we were trying to go to an

01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:04.540
open mic and it was a parking spot on a

01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:06.010
night when it's difficult to get parking

01:28:06.010 --> 01:28:12.670
spots or even Shane who can't parallel

01:28:12.670 --> 01:28:13.690
park could have parked in this parking

01:28:13.690 --> 01:28:15.820
spot right so I go to park and there's

01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:17.770
just this guy standing there he's

01:28:17.770 --> 01:28:19.480
wearing like like brown loafers tight

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:22.750
skinny jeans like a cool like athletic

01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:24.610
jacket but for fashion you know a little

01:28:24.610 --> 01:28:26.770
wealth like a wealthy white guy and he's

01:28:26.770 --> 01:28:27.790
got this look on his face he's just

01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:30.070
shaking his head looking at me like yeah

01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:32.800
I like the way he was doing it it was

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.750
like there was an old woman in the

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:36.370
restaurant and they were trying to park

01:28:36.370 --> 01:28:38.710
the car in front of the risk that the

01:28:38.710 --> 01:28:40.660
elderly know that get in the car did not

01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:41.960
did know that

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:44.480
he said it and when he said I was a ok

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.790
when he said it I said okay I've been

01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:49.640
what I wanna know I wanted him to like

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.590
because he was such a dick about he was

01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:53.420
looking I won him sweat here and he was

01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:57.410
going like no absolutely not yeah one

01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:58.730
way to look at it or he was just like

01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:04.250
you can't park you know okay tell me was

01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:05.810
he staying in a peaceful way or with you

01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:10.880
don't do not recall I do not recall he

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:13.160
admitted it in the car so not a car I

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:14.780
did not admit I he was belligerent

01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:20.240
so is about sanity well we didn't do we

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.220
didn't get stickers we ended up okay

01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:27.050

to get like a lower price on something

01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:49.510

actually kind of nice yeah Bernie old

01:32:57.670 --> 01:33:00.130
she'll get like she gets real hung up on

01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:00.940
customer service

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:04.030
so like she'll scold like you know you

01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:05.469
had a bit about being scared of the

01:33:05.469 --> 01:33:06.190
young black

01:33:06.190 --> 01:33:08.739
here's a doorman yeah so like they're

01:33:08.739 --> 01:33:10.630
kind of intimidating yeah Bernie will go

01:33:10.630 --> 01:33:12.550
up to them and be like like if they just

01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:13.690
start ringing up her stuffs like my

01:33:13.690 --> 01:33:15.370
day's going pretty well how about yours

01:33:15.370 --> 01:33:17.320
and she'll start like antagonizing like

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:19.239
that yeah yeah like like teaching them

01:33:19.239 --> 01:33:21.010
customer service I'll just sit there

01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:27.670
like I do when I see them like typing on

01:33:27.670 --> 01:33:30.100
their phone when I walk up to cash

01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:31.690
like I just like I'm hoping that the

01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:33.280
interaction goes well enough for them to

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:37.930
say something nice about me fighting

01:33:37.930 --> 01:33:40.030
yeah this guy just came up and checked

01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:42.550
out he's pretty cool yeah [ __ ] he had

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:46.750
his white son yeah yeah I'm just trying

01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:50.020
not to have them like flip on me yeah

01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:51.430
you know what I mean that's something me

01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:52.690
and Brittany fight about a lot where

01:33:52.690 --> 01:33:55.630
she'll she will proceed in her like day

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:57.880
to day interactions the big a big

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:00.130
trigger for her is perceived disrespect

01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:02.320
or I'll be like look you're in your work

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.520
environment you gotta chill out just

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.290
like learn how let people do their weird

01:34:05.290 --> 01:34:06.760
[ __ ] and his fault but she's like as

01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:07.719
soon as I feel like someone's

01:34:07.719 --> 01:34:10.510
disrespecting me I [ __ ] flip so it's

01:34:10.510 --> 01:34:12.640
like I'm fair enough then it will my

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.140
that's my point looks like a good fella

01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:20.620
okay spider yeah my point is I'll do the

01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.880
opposite we're all just let things

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:23.320
happen haven't happen to happen at and

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:25.330
that's a whole different problem I don't

01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:26.650
know if that's a problem cuz it's like

01:34:26.650 --> 01:34:29.560
if someone disrespects you like not

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:31.570
disrespect but just like this is my

01:34:31.570 --> 01:34:33.580
whole point of the internet interaction

01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:35.980
grid is you just like slowly you put up

01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.480
with stuff at of like an incremental

01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:39.489
level so we're next thing you know you

01:34:39.489 --> 01:34:41.710
know you're married at 26 you're living

01:34:41.710 --> 01:34:43.690
in New Jersey all this happens through

01:34:43.690 --> 01:34:47.680
like very little like concessions yeah

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:50.260
it's tough though like I I I get through

01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:51.820
that I do that a lot and stand up like

01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:53.110
forever I would just put up with

01:34:53.110 --> 01:34:55.090
anything yeah yeah sure I'll do it I'll

01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:56.949
do it for [ __ ] a hundred bucks yeah

01:34:56.949 --> 01:34:58.540
I'll do it like I'll do that and then

01:34:58.540 --> 01:34:59.860
once you start standing up for yourself

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:02.199
and get it people do hate you yes yeah

01:35:02.199 --> 01:35:03.880
that's true people tell me like he's a

01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:06.610
[ __ ] [ __ ] and it's like no well

01:35:06.610 --> 01:35:08.590
you're interacting the flow of all that

01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:10.150
interaction yeah there's been this clear

01:35:10.150 --> 01:35:12.070
pattern as soon as you break it it just

01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:13.390
drops the whole grid and then you just

01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:14.949
born back around you know whatever you

01:35:14.949 --> 01:35:17.199
lose and shake office like yeah it's

01:35:17.199 --> 01:35:19.510
weird because you there is a way that

01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:20.110
people

01:35:20.110 --> 01:35:22.840
- like treat you as you are and to them

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.989
that you kind of have to let them have

01:35:24.989 --> 01:35:27.219
well you can't you know you can't you

01:35:27.219 --> 01:35:29.110
can't fight every battle of every

01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:31.810
person's perception about you so you

01:35:31.810 --> 01:35:33.670
just like let them have that because for

01:35:33.670 --> 01:35:35.560
me I feel like a lot of people like I

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:37.540
come off as like an authority figure as

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:44.860
like overly intense or I get in those

01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:46.239
situations with the people like so the

01:35:46.239 --> 01:35:47.860
reason why I come off as autistic in

01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:48.880
those situations because I don't

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.820
escalate if if someone approaches me be

01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:53.980
like no no absolutely no I flip out well

01:35:53.980 --> 01:36:01.869
if there are stories present you with

01:36:01.869 --> 01:36:05.320
the white guy [ __ ] we just that what

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:05.830
do you look like

01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:08.230
let me see shades I'm gonna tell you

01:36:08.230 --> 01:36:10.330
this was he's three we were three years

01:36:10.330 --> 01:36:12.460
ago when we were pulling off yeah the

01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:14.440
first thing Shane Santa was sorry I was

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.750
a [ __ ] in that situation now in

01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:18.190
hindsight do you think maybe I was

01:36:18.190 --> 01:36:24.670
trying to appease a this is meaningless

01:36:24.670 --> 01:36:26.800
I'll just say this to him did you feel

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.780
like I was hostile afterwards you feel

01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:32.170
like I was exactly exactly the we were

01:36:32.170 --> 01:36:41.650
right back to normal because for me it's

01:36:41.650 --> 01:36:43.630
like okay now we're back to normal and I

01:36:43.630 --> 01:36:44.980
can start making fun of Shane but he was

01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:50.350
still like two days before I could bring

01:36:50.350 --> 01:37:04.150
that happens yeah I mean I was okay I

01:37:04.150 --> 01:37:09.909
just dude nothing changed yeah

01:37:09.909 --> 01:37:11.560
no it's fun it was fun it was a it was

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:14.560
just a funny situation to see yeah cuz

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:15.790
it was like I just felt like that would

01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:17.320
have been exactly to do Shane would have

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:19.389
been bullying in the comedy show he was

01:37:19.389 --> 01:37:21.969
such in a comedy show a million percent

01:37:21.969 --> 01:37:25.679
you know I'm always on stage dog

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:29.699
[Laughter]

01:37:29.699 --> 01:37:32.320
interaction grid you know that's the

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.590
strange stranger interaction

01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:36.179
a whole separate grid that's coming at

01:37:36.179 --> 01:37:37.500
you at random you can't really help that

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.210
but then as you were you they slowly

01:37:39.210 --> 01:37:40.949
kind of a mass into your little like

01:37:40.949 --> 01:37:42.300
center of gravity that's kind of like

01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:43.770
your everyday interaction if you

01:37:43.770 --> 01:37:44.969
interacted the stranger enough that

01:37:44.969 --> 01:37:46.469
becomes part of the interaction grid

01:37:46.469 --> 01:37:46.920
yeah

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:49.050
like the lady yet that makes my I see

01:37:49.050 --> 01:37:50.909
Asahi bowls I have a heart I have a hard

01:37:50.909 --> 01:37:54.690
time accepting like the stranger

01:37:54.690 --> 01:37:56.699
etiquette I think or we have to act like

01:37:56.699 --> 01:37:58.409
we don't know we're both people right

01:37:58.409 --> 01:38:00.270
now you know I was at the I was at a

01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:02.460
cupcake shop and I'm getting my cupcake

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:10.650

hard period of sweet treat indulge me

01:38:17.670 --> 01:38:19.010

store does that happen to me hard dude

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.820
if I do anything physical I definitely

01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:28.800
treat myself so like I'm I'll scale it

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:32.070
down and then see what weight I can be

01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:34.349

it's like Paul could have been at West

01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:21.530
Point yeah that's that's the same thing

01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:23.599
again I remember somebody was like Dan

01:41:30.170 --> 01:41:31.849
yogge five miles do it everyday

01:41:31.849 --> 01:41:33.590
there's recruitment on you'll be a cadet

01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:35.059
yeah that's a funny thing to put on

01:41:35.059 --> 01:41:37.099
someone else yeah yeah people love doing

01:41:37.099 --> 01:41:43.639
that yeah I mean I think about it with

01:41:43.639 --> 01:41:46.130
football a lot yeah I could have been

01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:48.230
pretty good do you find it hard to go

01:41:48.230 --> 01:41:49.489
back to your hometown because that

01:41:49.489 --> 01:41:52.719
sometimes not wrong yeah

01:41:55.219 --> 01:41:57.860
oh yeah quitter holder no no no now I'm

01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:01.430
happy to go back yeah are you guys up to

01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:05.150
that's pretty tight uh no it's no I have

01:42:05.150 --> 01:42:06.949
no shame in quitting football or West

01:42:06.949 --> 01:42:08.150
Point no care at all

01:42:08.150 --> 01:42:10.489
yeah no no I mean well unless you're

01:42:10.489 --> 01:42:13.040
gonna go pro it's like all you can be is

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:14.630
slightly like wow he played it a

01:42:14.630 --> 01:42:16.340
slightly better college I know I mean I

01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:18.650
was like I have friends that sacrificed

01:42:18.650 --> 01:42:20.930
their [ __ ] entire bodies to be like

01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:23.840
yeah I played at Elon yeah let's go

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:25.250
probably get be like why could've been a

01:42:25.250 --> 01:42:27.530
bigger I could have been in like had a

01:42:27.530 --> 01:42:29.780
better college football not just saying

01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:31.040
is a good college football story but

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.449
like yeah it would have been slightly

01:42:32.449 --> 01:42:34.370
more impressive it had more pride in

01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:38.540
myself you know more deeply frustrated

01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:40.460
if you gave your body to a thing that

01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:42.080
you just can't do in the later part of

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.940
your life it must be getting a football

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:46.670
coach you would've been in mesh into

01:42:46.670 --> 01:42:47.870
college scandal right now for like

01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:49.670
abusing I wanted to be a football coach

01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:50.930
that would have been something I would

01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:52.370
have done that might have ended really

01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:55.040
badly though probably I mean that could

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:58.210
have been like it all ends badly

01:42:58.390 --> 01:43:00.830
ya know but that's something you do

01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:04.280
later in life sure in a couple um back

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:07.850
doors there may be more of a outlet

01:43:07.850 --> 01:43:09.560
built into it but like footballs very

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.239
win lose win lose actually stand up

01:43:11.239 --> 01:43:12.469
might be worse for you because like you

01:43:12.469 --> 01:43:13.730
don't even think you win when you want

01:43:13.730 --> 01:43:16.550
stand up is if I lose I'm like I am the

01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:18.350
big sometimes you think you lost and you

01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:20.449
did it of course so it is only be worse

01:43:20.449 --> 01:43:22.640
but I'm seeing a bunch of kids like like

01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:23.960
alright now drink your Gatorades get out

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.340
there and they're just swallowing longer

01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:36.070
as you like losers you made me look yeah

01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:38.120
there's a coat you'd have been very

01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:39.710
intense if you became how I would've

01:43:39.710 --> 01:43:44.090
been a player's coach yeah yeah I used

01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:46.280
to stay you I mean all of your reality

01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:48.590
to go to your version of you but I was a

01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:50.449
real into business so like if I stayed

01:43:50.449 --> 01:43:52.190
in the business yeah I you say you were

01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:53.480
in the business the way now you're in

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:55.040
the mushrooms like it was the same guy

01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:56.870
like I was into football the way I'm

01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:59.600
into stand-up now the same attitude yeah

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.070
but I feel like what you get into can

01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:03.949
definitely like more for your output it

01:44:03.949 --> 01:44:05.449
like I was into business and I was like

01:44:05.449 --> 01:44:08.570
I would have gotten wrapped up in like a

01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:09.070
Bernie man

01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:10.780

an area you got told me it was an ex-nfl

01:49:58.990 --> 01:50:01.180
player why I usually I'm thinking about

01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:03.610
