00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.520
thousand feet or something but no but I

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.700
I know when I was in Hawaii above the

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.290
clouds I think was like eighteen sixteen

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.330
thousand feet maybe that's just the

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.400
terminology for like yeah like they say

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.400
it's like the highest grow up a mountain

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.750
that was literally above the cloud so I

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.460
know Vermont was [ __ ] ballin like

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.500
that amount n' that was on was like you

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.270
could see the snow going like off the

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.950
peak because of the wind it was like

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.170

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.020

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.450

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.170
I've never even I don't think I've ever

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.960

that one thing it's like rollerblading

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:03.680
of skis oh I think I think this smaller

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.520
the ski the harder this naturally a

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.590
longer ski is easier I don't know if I

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.940
wasn't the guy said I would think

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.010
smaller skis what I would think but

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.110
apparently it's no skis are tough

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.820
oh you should probably stop easier yeah

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.310

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.570

sample so the the show in question gives

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.750

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.860
defend democratic women or female

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.770
minorities from Republican attacks so

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.649
the joke's on this supposed comedy show

00:24:57.649 --> 00:25:00.260
was political it was only defend women

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.870

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.909
literally I mean it's not busy at all

00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:25.010
but the directions specifically had

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.110
Democratic women yeah that's who you're

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.760
supposed to defend Democrats yeah yeah

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.340
only Democrats well that how aligned

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.529
with a political party can you be suck

00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:35.450
when you literally in the directions for

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.460
your future writers I like only defend

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.500
Democrats what sucks is rage you just

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:44.929
got out of that thing that got some

00:25:44.929 --> 00:25:46.669
Democrats like duty I got out of a super

00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:48.320
Republican thing that would that still

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.990
might kind of [ __ ] my career up yeah

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.220
being associated with you could also

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.350
denounced which would be cool and then

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.230
you did the the mainstream like this is

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.270
a really popular show yes this left-wing

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:02.510
[ __ ] blatant in the directions like

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.419
be Pro Democrat sucks so what the [ __ ]

00:26:05.419 --> 00:26:08.570
yeah talk about our operation [ __ ]

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.880
Mockingjay dude you can't tell me

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.230
someone's that why that's so weird that

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.700
is weird right it's [ __ ] bizarre a

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.980
comedy show yeah well I mean that's also

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.200
the only other logical explanation is

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.450
that they did the focus groups and found

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.100
that like whoever's digesting that show

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.720
lean primarily left and they want to

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.950
alienate that all they want to do is

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.640
keep keep the [ __ ] group thing going

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.660

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.410
Leo done since that [ __ ] I always watch

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.390
his stuff vice just did a thing on black

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.030
conservatives which is half our thing on

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:20.120
it yesterday you know what they [ __ ]

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.650
did and that's what it was really

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.510
oh I think somebody posted on the reddit

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.610
I think that's really they did this

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:27.860
thing studying black conservatives and

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.350
of course they sent a [ __ ] black

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.940
reporter for sure yeah they couldn't

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.160
imagine sending one of those white dorks

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:40.640
that they have oh my god black

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.990

shaved the [ __ ] with the bullets that

01:00:31.459 --> 01:00:34.039
made him untraceable or like the caliber

01:00:34.039 --> 01:00:37.519
or at war wrong size shoes yeah so when

01:00:37.519 --> 01:00:38.779

as far as the break-in and murder goes

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:56.109
