as a child president there was a baby in

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.140
there there's a baby there so I'd hope

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.310
they're at least treating that baby with

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.720

how spook to the event I bought a

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.100
pumpkin you bought a prompt you a lot of

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.660
pumpkin dude I'm gonna carve a really

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.330
spooky what are you gonna do it there's

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.250
a real jagged eyes and crooked teeth

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.100
it's gonna be so spooky what are you

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.800
gonna make it Asian no well you know

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.030
what's funny though about your set is

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.050
that I just read a study that begs to

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:54.640
differ and well you had a nice little

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.890
sample size in terms of the crowd but

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.290
it's like who's cart compartmentalizing

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.310
who's sitting in the crowd and being

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.310
like there's like like I can't say

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.330
there's a lot of people who won't say

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.360
that they did a study recently if I

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.740
meant to look at this sample size but it

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.990
was like tens of thousands of people and

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.390
they had from all races genders all this

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.870
stuff and they asked like his PC culture

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.570
can it be problematic and is hate speech

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.780
problematic and like looked like sixty

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.640
five seventy percent of people were like

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.320
PC culture can be just from that dorm

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.690
Peterson debate no this was everyone

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.210
they brought that up why the durham

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.539
peterson verse the black did the

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.520
beginning they had a poll who michael

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.140
art no no no that's what i wasn't sure

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.610
if it was that no this was like a

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.479
scientific I guess qualitative study no

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:44.920
they just asked people stuff I did

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.160
notice like first off after the show

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.120
almost everyone I talked it was like

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.209
that was Hawaii's that joke was raised

00:08:51.209 --> 00:08:53.040
there were people holding back laughter

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.199
yeah but there were also three hot

00:08:55.199 --> 00:08:56.610
chicks in the very front row that were

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.490
they were like none too pleased oh yeah

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.139

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:02.699
hot chicks that were like I can't

straight up [ __ ] not easy dude

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.860
straight out for naughty book it might

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.269
be the original what's that one book

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:12.149
everyone reads the game what is that

00:10:12.149 --> 00:10:13.470
like that was like a pick-up artist book

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.089
it's called the game a lot of people

00:10:15.089 --> 00:10:16.799
read it yeah it's pretty much next

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:21.949
Tucker Max is it might be Tucker max

00:10:22.369 --> 00:10:25.170
yeah well do my [ __ ] this chicken she

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.490
[ __ ] her so he's such a liar that onna

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.410
is like one of the best oh yeah when

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.639
they call it a mountain when Tucker max

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:34.319
in the studio and he starts said they're

00:10:34.319 --> 00:10:35.670
like tell us a story and then while he's

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.829
telling it they start to be like did you

00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:40.559
oh is that what happened he's such a

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:42.449
[ __ ] loser he keeps telling it yeah

00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:42.929
he sucks

00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:45.420
oh but so they study they found that

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.879
like 60% of people they asked like from

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:50.189
all races they even broke it down like

00:10:50.189 --> 00:10:51.929
racial groups wise like maybe it's just

00:10:51.929 --> 00:10:52.949
like all white people think it's not

00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:54.809
problematic but it came out to her like

00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:56.759
again like 65% of people thought it was

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:59.040
problematic from all race groups except

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.470
for black people who was like 63%

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.579
thought it was problematic so it was

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.920
slightly less and then they asked if

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.010
speech is problematic in like 83 85

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.209
percent of people were like yeah

00:11:09.209 --> 00:11:11.550
definitely problematic still a [ __ ]

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:16.980
15 kicking around like well but what was

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.110
interesting it's the people who were

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.990
like like PC culture is super super

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.810
important overwhelmingly are white women

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.360
with master's degrees and above who make

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.000
over $100,000 a year and then on the

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.829
flip side people were like [ __ ] PC

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:34.680
cultures ruin it's typically white

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.320
people on just like another economic

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.459
spectrum there's stuff like different

00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:40.680
values so this is basically a battle of

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.120
white people that's what the study came

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.920
up with us like of course it is

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.600
most people don't give a [ __ ] this is

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.820
just white factions of white people

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.070
arguing and like the rest of course it

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.600
is called like the tired majority or

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.560
whatever and there's just like all right

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.389
guys two thirds of the country is just

00:11:57.389 --> 00:12:00.149
like you guys done with this [ __ ] yeah

00:12:00.149 --> 00:12:01.620
yeah dude it's pretty that was crazy

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.269
that's what I was trying to tell Dweck

00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:04.410
the whole time we were making that

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.600
[ __ ] series I was like dude just we

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.040

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.750
just right down the middle yeah cuz

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.730
everyone's tired of all this make fun of

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.470

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.699
[ __ ] yeah for sure

00:12:14.699 --> 00:12:16.740
speaking of dude my friend hit me up and

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.300

they're like in the shower well that's

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.830
pretty much exactly what Navy SEALs

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.020
basic training is - for sure you know I

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:16.680

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.170

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.960
like well actually mom she tried to hit

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.150
me with the [ __ ] it's so funny to

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.550
hear like a younger person's the

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.900
information that they're all receiving

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.850
she's like Abraham Lincoln was part

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.670
black like I don't know why people are

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.650
trying to tell you that we're know he

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.560
was wrong there's also like Abraham

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.170
Lincoln was like gay Native American

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.200
black and white it's like dude what is

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.630

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.600

guy from the woods

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.260
yeah but it's just funny the way people

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.840
are trying to modernize history because

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.850

are they doing they have they're like in

00:39:06.049 --> 00:39:08.269
the process of having a military

00:39:08.269 --> 00:39:10.729
dictator win the election hell yeah yeah

00:39:10.729 --> 00:39:12.319
he's like people are like he says

00:39:12.319 --> 00:39:14.929
Brazil's Trump and this guy's like he's

00:39:14.929 --> 00:39:17.779

military dictator he's the one

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.040
he's what they are afraid Trump is

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.900

could yeah if he was in Brazil

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.890
yes but the read what they're saying is

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:40.460
is that people are doing this because

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.140
they're like sticking it to the system

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.370
which is like if you think about it it's

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:46.130
like Hilary Bush claimed all those

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.260
people that's a system and people like

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.670
to Trump was there like [ __ ] those guys

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.110
this guy's not a politician

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.060
[ __ ] and that's happening in a bunch of

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.230
other countries and he's like but

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:55.310
they're putting in like right-wing

00:39:55.310 --> 00:40:00.590

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:02.720
how much people don't like you to wear

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.040

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:15.200
a profound effect yeah I mean the

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.120

Barcelona's independence and [ __ ] and

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.410
they would like argue back and forth you

do like fake news but yeah it's pretty

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:30.410

it's like the fuel on the fire for

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.920
right-wing dictatorships I hope not

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.260
because that's if we get if we hit if we

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.060
actually get hit with World War 3 and we

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:41.339
act

00:41:41.339 --> 00:41:42.509
you have to worry about the apocalypse

00:41:42.509 --> 00:41:45.599
and our factions well right now I'm now

00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:47.309
my greatest fear in the apocalypse is

00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:50.099
your brother [ __ ] me up please gonna

00:41:50.099 --> 00:41:52.410
call them as soon as soon as nukes start

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:53.880
flying I have a feeling Billy's gonna

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.499
kick down my door and just beat the [ __ ]

00:41:57.739 --> 00:42:00.809
what if though it just is some weird

00:42:00.809 --> 00:42:02.579
thing we're like all the right-wing

00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:05.700
dictators just [ __ ] meet in jail

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:10.469
they're like oh so you think the New

00:42:10.469 --> 00:42:13.079
World Order and peace in the world is

00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:14.729
gonna be a bunch of sick ass right-wing

00:42:14.729 --> 00:42:17.489
dictators like Trombley Joong Geun Kim

00:42:17.489 --> 00:42:21.239
jong-un duarte from the Philippines it's

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:23.579
Brazilian baller dude the black dude I

[ __ ] sick I'm so tough on crime

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:28.859
they're just back and forth they'll be

00:42:28.859 --> 00:42:32.789
so funny yeah I mean hopefully

00:42:32.789 --> 00:42:35.249
right-wing dictators save the world I

00:42:35.249 --> 00:42:38.910
got a feeling they won't yeah that's

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.039

nice and then all these people a lot of

00:42:43.319 --> 00:42:45.799
it too is like is the reason these guys

00:42:45.799 --> 00:42:48.690
part of it they can propel themselves to

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.849
power so hard is because like the hard

00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:53.130

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:38.670
thing with movies like the dialog and

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:41.280
movies like when it's corny yeah like me

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.450
like you people don't talk like that

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:45.119
yeah I think that's going away yeah and

00:48:45.119 --> 00:48:47.940
then I think like like the same way it

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.920
used to when a class a man yeah like

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.540
people like no one talks like this yeah

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.730
and then it stills like dialogue and

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.109
movies is improving to the point where

00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:56.640
it's like this is what this is a real

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.930
conversation yeah for sure

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:59.369
nobody has a witty response every

00:48:59.369 --> 00:49:01.470
[ __ ] time yeah nobody's charming

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:03.390
constantly like see cops gonna dick a

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:06.720
crime scene like whoa somebody was

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.670
hungry yeah it's like now did they show

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:10.590
up in that call Jesus Christ there's a

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:12.570
whole group of people who love that [ __ ]

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:15.570
man like yeah idiots yeah but they were

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:17.670
a guy like every [ __ ] dude in every

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:19.410
movie is like at some point like a

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:21.599
certain type of movie hits his walk-in

00:49:21.599 --> 00:49:23.760
closet there's like 16 watches 50

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.930
button-down shirts and she's a whole

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:26.280
scene of this guy getting dressed and

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.050
it's like it's the rock that's really

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.450
exactly the [ __ ] rock look I have so

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:31.800
many let's check out my wards with it on

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.420
my cuff links all I have are suits in my

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.280
claws I love cuff links and working out

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.730
and I disrupt you're in Jumanji you

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:41.580
don't disrupt you [ __ ] loser [ __ ] the

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.560
rock all right back to this point so

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.849
like I think that's changing I think

00:49:44.849 --> 00:49:47.070
it's like news correspondents mm-hmm

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:49.050
like local news that [ __ ] cadence

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.700
they use that's got to change

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.200
yeah look you've got to keep it on it

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.790
and I think politicians are gonna have

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:55.530
to change too well they know they're

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:57.450
doing it because they saw Trump came out

00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:59.700
and it was just rather than they well he

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:01.680
was just like I pay you I pay you photo

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.560
yeah dude they all were like [ __ ] cuz

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.300
now I'm noticing all of them doing it

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.099
they're like he's a jerk they'll say

00:50:08.099 --> 00:50:10.320
like Jay and they know it's like a

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.060
political strategy yeah but even that

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.700
will become a thing people do because

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:15.750
that's becoming me I'm watching

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:17.849
politicians now they they're like oh we

00:50:17.849 --> 00:50:19.170
can talk through this now like oh it

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:21.030
works really well they all do yet when

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:22.710
they fake it you can tell like someone

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:24.390
fakes really I'll try to do it when

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:26.970
someone dares to swear mm-hmm like I'll

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:28.380
never forget Kellen Winslow

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.970
he played tight end

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:32.220
was at Miami yeah this is while he was

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.680
still in Miami he like leveled some dude

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.780
from Tennessee yeah and they're like it

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.280
a reporter was like it looked like he

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.020
tried to hurt him and he was like hell

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.000
yeah I tried to hurt him I'm a [ __ ]

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.020
soldier and it just came out like dude

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.700
why'd you try to swear well that's like

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.560
me if I were to try to be like what's up

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.420
dawg if I hope people like that we can

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:53.490
tell by like you're gonna master those

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:55.800
whatever those my new like tongue vessel

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.090
so like not sound like you're just kind

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:59.340
of putting on an act when people curse

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.050
who don't usually curse and they try to

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:02.760
be cool with it it's like yeah they

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.080
always hesitate for a second to like

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.900
he's just some yeah I think that'll

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.119
change I think hopefully we can get past

00:51:12.119 --> 00:51:15.890
all the all the BS man and just really

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:19.250
honest unless we come into like a try

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.510
there's a ton of right-wing dictators

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:23.130
dude right-wing dictators I knows a

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:25.410
little bit one is a left-wing they're

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:27.570
full communism right yeah that's that's

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:29.160
that's what happens when the left goes

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:29.580
wild

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:31.260
yeah China you'll get yeah and they'll

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:32.250

Pakistan and I can see someone's

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.180
overflow in there

you're like a Pakistani Muslim that

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:55.440
needs to get out it's like so I go the

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.849

got triggered horn I got on and it

00:55:05.119 --> 00:55:06.829
wasn't the rock this time that triggered

00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:11.799
me it was just like a meme that was like

00:55:11.799 --> 00:55:14.719
there's a ongoing joke that white people

00:55:14.719 --> 00:55:16.880
don't have culture mmm that has become

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.400
like ingrained yeah in like that's a

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:19.940
fact

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:21.799
that white people don't have culture

00:55:21.799 --> 00:55:25.219
okay which is lame as [ __ ] for that to

00:55:25.219 --> 00:55:26.930
annoy me but it annoys it's like well

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:30.739
yeah our culture is everything yeah but

00:55:30.739 --> 00:55:34.640
uh then it's like I read that joke about

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.140
white people not having culture it and

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:37.910
then I looked at this black chicks

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:40.009
Instagram story that was like white

00:55:40.009 --> 00:55:41.569

take it but I don't know I don't know

00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:51.289
it's just it's funny to hear people

00:55:51.289 --> 00:55:52.489
constantly be like white people don't

00:55:52.489 --> 00:55:54.170
have culture well what do you mean by

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:56.150

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.719
dancing

00:55:56.719 --> 00:55:59.890
yeah we're probably number two though

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:01.940
dancing that's true a lot of the people

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:03.799
who like like a lot of those like Indian

everything [ __ ] then because in the

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:25.160
flipside if people like people did

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.440
ideation centers is tight where you just

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.089

00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:53.029
than easy no you can't say and Kanye

00:57:53.029 --> 00:57:55.279

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:16.489
have is love in my heart I mean that's

00:58:16.489 --> 00:58:20.089

00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:27.019
well you can see you can have an easy to

00:58:27.019 --> 00:58:29.660
heart from doing too much gym drinking

00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:31.819
too much jack3d oh dude here's my idea

00:58:31.819 --> 00:58:35.119
though I want to take put little lights

00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:37.460
in the ceiling like figure this right I

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:39.470
don't know how the lights in the soon no

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:41.329
no check this out so they're right on

00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:42.650
the corner where the ceiling meets the

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:44.239
wall and I don't know how to engineer so

00:58:44.239 --> 00:58:46.039
the light distributes pop properly but

00:58:46.039 --> 00:58:47.450
you could just come in and hit a switch

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:49.210
and then change the color of your room

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:52.880
boom or Halloween time you upload the

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.249
colors or images and those will all like

00:58:55.249 --> 00:58:57.170
the wallpaper yeah being a projector

00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:59.299
it'll change the paint of the wall yes

00:58:59.299 --> 00:59:00.829
you'd you'd have like a white wall and

00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:02.390
then you hit it and then that boom you

00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:03.890
have a perfectly green room flip the

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:05.960
dial boom the rooms purple upload a

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.759
creepy Halloween image you have spooky

00:59:07.759 --> 00:59:09.280
spiders

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:11.560
yeah you know if people want study rooms

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:12.640
for Halloween

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.680
even have a towel where you just put

00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.180
like a beautiful fresco on your wall

00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.400
just upload the thing it's projects onto

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:22.420
your wall pretty tight pretty stick idea

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:23.980
I think is pretty tight yeah I think

00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:28.540
that's easily done Dylan does it why you

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:29.680
could paint you could change the whole

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.330
color if you did it properly with the

00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:32.350
lights you could change the whole color

00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:35.530
room and incident pretty tight all right

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:37.420
I think it's good I think it's what do

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.340
you want to call it if you had to if you

00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:40.630
had to think of a name for it what would

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.930
it be

00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:44.020

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:30.280
the the Kanye Drake thing it's like dude

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:34.270
if the two scenarios if Kanye did here

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:35.350
you know what the whole thing was that

01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:37.270
like he invited him to record yeah in

01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:39.790
Wyoming and Drake for some reason opened

01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:41.080
up to him even though he's had beef with

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.540
Pusha T and made fun of Kid Cudi's

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.580
depression and for some reason was like

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.870
let me tell you about my secret son

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:49.090
Kanye and I opened up to Kanye and then

01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:51.550
Kanye was like he gave him that beat for

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:53.800
lift yourself whatever and that was one

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.810
he did ask you pity poop so in this

01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:56.320
story

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.230
Kanye lured him Drake to the Lord drag

01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:01.330
the Wyoming and was like I got a beat

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:01.810
for you

01:01:01.810 --> 01:01:03.550
gave him one and then put it out with

01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:05.940
him saying scoop it he poop all over it

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:09.910
Pusha T on Drake's personal secrets and

01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:11.530
then they trashed him on a diss record

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:14.260
that's Drake's version it also could be

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.600
he got trashed on a diss record and then

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.950
was waiting waiting waiting he's like

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:19.750
all everyone's mad at Kanye now all sick

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:20.950
and someone was like you had to say this

01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:21.880
and he's like

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.370
I hate when he's talking he's like and

01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:26.980
then so we go the studio my man's right

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.110

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:31.360
so we fly down there I'm like I cool and

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.130
then we go down and I'm like what it's

01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:36.220
like I [ __ ] love Drake such a lamest

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:36.970

01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:38.710
I like Drake though these musics great

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:40.870
you don't have a problem with them when

01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:42.250
they get on and we're in the barbershop

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:43.630

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.320
like rap is like the only real music

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.880
that kind of influences our culture

little on the drive after the show and

01:23:20.699 --> 01:23:23.499
it was fun until I smoked and I smoked

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:24.579
and I'm sitting there looking out the

01:23:24.579 --> 01:23:26.199
window thinking about who's gonna be at

01:23:26.199 --> 01:23:27.559
my funeral

01:23:27.559 --> 01:23:30.980

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:32.630
much of an Irish brain to smoke weed you

01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:34.309
instantly just think of your bad news

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:35.960
and just like fit you go instantly go to

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.179
Finnegan's Wake instantly I was just

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:43.460
like what's it gonna be like I thought

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:46.520
of how human history has been nothing

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.309
but absolute misery for everyone no I'm

01:23:49.309 --> 01:23:52.369
lucky to live in where I am now but how

01:23:52.369 --> 01:23:54.409
it's fragile true and how if it ever

01:23:54.409 --> 01:23:57.139
revert back to just pure chaos I'm like

01:23:57.139 --> 01:23:58.610
people just watched their family die

01:23:58.610 --> 01:24:01.250
back in the day yeah it's like I can't

01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:02.119
yeah

01:24:02.119 --> 01:24:04.489
too soft well that would [ __ ] note

01:24:04.489 --> 01:24:06.409
shaving you up real quick and so ders

01:24:06.409 --> 01:24:08.000
like yeah Ronald Reagan said if any

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.440
generation is gonna experience the

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:16.280
apocalypse it's this one I know of

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.000
course forever yeah but like the you

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.369

01:24:22.369 --> 01:24:24.500
dictators coming in yeah Hasan I'm

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:25.909
sitting there with one hit of a vape pen

01:24:25.909 --> 01:24:34.969
just like the apocalypse is nigh talked

01:24:34.969 --> 01:24:36.320
about side effect that we need is

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.239
thinking about the apocalypse it's got

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:40.340
me I think on the I kind of own some

01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:42.730
perverse level you look forward to it I

01:24:42.730 --> 01:24:45.889
will die and then I was like nobody just

01:24:45.889 --> 01:24:49.130
had to kill yourself no need I thought

01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:50.090
of me and my family

01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:51.920
committing suicide together know

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.420
yourself it was a horrible time see I

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:58.039
don't feel fit for this particular mode

01:24:58.039 --> 01:25:00.409
of life yeah I you are not I don't think

01:25:00.409 --> 01:25:02.389
so I'm always fantasizing about

01:25:02.389 --> 01:25:04.789
humungous societal changes to where it's

01:25:04.789 --> 01:25:06.590
like alright now like like we could live

01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:08.239
in villages or do like vertical farm

01:25:08.239 --> 01:25:09.500
villages where everyone lives in like

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:11.270
skyscrapers and like lives in like a

01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:13.520
jungle environment [ __ ] you know they're

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.889
talking about doing that building like

01:25:14.889 --> 01:25:17.809

01:25:17.809 --> 01:25:19.520
back to that dude give me a [ __ ]

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.800
village but you know that's right that's

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.989
kinda what I fantasize about yeah I was

01:25:23.989 --> 01:25:26.510
just in my mind again this was me hi

01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:28.460
yeah it's like if there's some sort of a

01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:33.050
pot like a nuclear holocaust like me and

01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:34.940
my family are just in I was envisioning

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.610

01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:38.889
our Intel's yeah I mean like we're stuck

01:25:38.889 --> 01:25:40.030

01:25:42.159 --> 01:25:43.840
family shooting ourselves it was [ __ ]

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.460
up you might actually go out and be able

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:48.820
to like deal with the nuclear fallout my

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:50.619
family your eyebrows might fall off yeah

01:25:50.619 --> 01:25:56.920

01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:02.260

there's always like a stray hair that's

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:17.170
long 2525 yeah so I can call it we're

01:26:17.170 --> 01:26:23.020

Tommy Pope that'll be a fun show yeah

01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:35.679
that's actually what maybe bees are on

01:26:35.679 --> 01:26:38.800
the couch I have to tell you this

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.480
morning that's I was just walking my dog

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.550
just sober as a [ __ ] judge thinking

01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:45.790
about an alternate setup for people once

01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:47.320
people can't like work or like if

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.790
technology takes over or like you just

01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:50.590
everyone's even like disability or some

01:26:50.590 --> 01:26:52.360
sort of income and you just develop

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.889
these areas people to live that are like

01:26:53.889 --> 01:26:55.869
villages and then you give people like

01:26:55.869 --> 01:26:57.969
Foam swords Laser Tag guns and you just

01:26:57.969 --> 01:27:01.090
get to like reenact like old-school or

01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:03.010
avatar warfare and then you just get all

01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:04.420
your basic needs met and like if you get

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:06.250
laser tag three times or hit with a foam

01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:08.139
so you're just a larper and then you

01:27:08.139 --> 01:27:09.489
could just live for all day long and

01:27:09.489 --> 01:27:12.070
then you live in a society where you can

01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:14.170
LARP all day long that's all there is to

01:27:14.170 --> 01:27:17.949

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.410
Jurassic Park of

01:27:50.410 --> 01:27:52.720

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:09.760
happen is people would start really

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.860
fighting I think a [ __ ] guy will

01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:15.310
fall out of where someone would rape

01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:18.100
someone in the village it would just

01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:20.620
turn into a medieval people would get

01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:24.700
beheaded the real the second you build a

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:26.970
village for [ __ ] people to fight

01:28:26.970 --> 01:28:34.810

01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:46.000
three-foot ditch and get raped having a

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.070
