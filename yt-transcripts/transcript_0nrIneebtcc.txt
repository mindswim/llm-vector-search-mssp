there's that there's a whole thing i

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.200
think a lot of people worry about like

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.600
what's going to happen it's like

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.119
at the grocery store and you'll try to

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.640
use a coupon and like i'm sorry that

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.080
expired

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.200
you're like dude i'm telling you i've

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.800
i've gotten into like lego spirals

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.760
before where i'm like

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.520
[ __ ] i don't know what's gonna happen

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.040
when i die [ __ ]

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.599

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.879
soul one time so i'm like

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.040
that's pretty cool so yeah i was just

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.400
wondering if it was it was one of those

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.440
things where it was like

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.920
like a tragic couple of seconds where it

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.720
was like oh

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.400
i'm aware of myself but then it feels

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.319
like you spend an infinite amount of

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.599
time just like

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.680
taking yourself apart you're like oh no

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.720
dude and you just get

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.920
locked up that's you're talking about

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.040
deep level you're talking about peak

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.120
experiences that's

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.519
i mean is that like a clinical term yeah

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.200
one pig experience can retroactively

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.599
fill a person's entire life of meaning

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.000
so i i've i'm deep into logo therapy

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.360
right i'm a survivor

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.200
is that is it good or bad you're a peak

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.159
experience survivor

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.959
i don't know if it's good you need peak

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.360
this is a peak experience i think i'm

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.040
having a peak experience you definitely

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.200
yeah good or bad yeah sydney you know

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.080
it's all mushrooms

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.280

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.879
not a problem but you are almost i mean

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.400
just being honest i am allegedly on

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.879
mushrooms

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.920
that was a really strong move yeah that

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.080
i will say that was a very strong

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.959
move to say like i'm just going to do

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.480
mushrooms and head on down there and see

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.680
what's up that's awesome

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.560
that's almost like giving some

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.319
appreciation sending yourself somewhere

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.000
on a big dose of mushrooms that's a gift

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.519
to whoever you're sending yourself to

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.040
yeah it's kind of like sending a puppy

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.720
but you're the puppy yeah it's like

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.319
gifting someone a puppy in a box

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.000
you're like hey guys all right don't let

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.640
this kill itself

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.080
hey guys i'm very excited right now

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.959
but you can laugh at it no one's ever

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:59.680
been more

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.439
to the thing you're doing than me right

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:01.690
now

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.920
[Laughter]

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.799
let's go outside guys come on that would

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.560
be a sick [ __ ] gift to get the

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.480
industry of human puppies

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.920
right like you don't have a dog we have

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.000
a human who just completely dogs out for

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.400
like three months i mean i'm not trying

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.840
to get a step on dog girl's toes i'm

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.600
talking more non-sexual

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.680
yeah sending a human puppy to somebody

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.720
emotional puppy

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.160
yeah just someone like he will just do

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.840
nothing but stare at you eat from the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.639
floor and then

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.320
if you lay down they lay on you that

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.919
would be [ __ ] up i mean i think

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.919
people like to have kids live in nannies

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.360
you could get a live-in

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.520
wait what were we calling him uh human

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.199
puppies but i think i might regret this

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.960
terminology because i think i'm now like

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.800
no people did used to have human puppies

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.759
they were called slaves

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.080
but in terms of getting a living nanny

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.919
then slowly like bending your mind into

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.120
like the legacy

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.160
puppies in america

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.250
what if they never invented the word

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.430
[Laughter]

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.639
you imagine thomas jefferson with his

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.840
wife like out in his fields like oh

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.520

person's house thing is

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.360
a old person's house is like they should

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.720
have like instead of like a

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.160
like terror behind the walls you should

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.440
just let you in like an 80 year old

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.399
who's been living by themselves yeah

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.040

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.320
conditioner

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.399
well it's terrifying dude i have one

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.760
grandmother uh

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.760
she's no longer with this she her house

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.240
when i was a kid smelled

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.640
like i guess a different there was two

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.079
different kinds of old people house i

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:25.440
smelled one where it was like

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.360
this is old very old furniture but it's

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.800
been well maintained and cleaned

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.720
nice and my other grandmother you like

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.760
it didn't stink but you could definitely

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.600
you had clues that someone smoked and

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.680
owned a dog yeah it's not like they [ __ ]

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.519
themselves it's just like the smell of

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:39.920
the

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.720
old house typically stinks dude yeah not

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.279
like

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:46.079
like poop it just stinks like just like

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:47.040
[ __ ] weird

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.920
[ __ ] it's just it's just time dude yeah

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.760
yeah there's a there's a living person

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.720
dying in here oh

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.160
yeah they're cleaner that they smell

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.519
that in the air they don't make that

00:10:55.519 --> 00:11:01.839
scent anymore so it's unfamiliar to you

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.000
there's a lot of chemicals floating

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.240
around the house yeah also too if you

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.519
think about it dude i mean

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:12.800
all right so you're born in 1903

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.079
that was what like pre like

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:17.920
computerized car that was like driving

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.440
in like a 1920

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.800
1920s cars looked [ __ ] like advanced

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.320
compared to 1903 cars

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.640
so when was the model t invented i have

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.360
no idea

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.560
probably like that yeah i feel like the

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.399
50s the 1900s yeah right

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.880
so what i'm saying is you're born and

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.000
this has been throughout history you're

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.480
born

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.560
and by the time you're dead well i would

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.920
say recent history because like some

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.200
people could go like five thousand years

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.880
of things being the same but now

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.959
it's like you know we're born in the 80s

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:44.560
dude when we're [ __ ] 90 the world is

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.120
going to be

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.720
crazy because imagine your grandparents

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.480
coming into a pre-digital world

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.000
yeah and then like having the internet

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
explained to them at like 80.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
yeah just like pretty [ __ ] up what

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
well i mean 1908 was the model

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.720
t i cannot believe i said 1950 and i

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.760
told you

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.839
both i am on the most mushrooms i've

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:03.519
ever been on and you were like he's got

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:04.399
it

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:05.680
oh you might have access when the

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.800
corvette was unleashed

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:15.200
that's sick dude i was dude just like

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.040
[ __ ] getting a sick ass car

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.440
and having that be like do you think

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.200
that do you think it instantly got you

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.000
[ __ ]

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.839
or did the dad have to like model t

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:25.200
you're talking about yeah we're like

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.560
it was there a chance that like you were

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.639
kind of like a [ __ ] if you were

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.839
getting a car in the beginning and then

00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:30.800
it had to catch on

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.839
big time dude it would have been like

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:34.320
having a robot now

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.560
[ __ ] you you could back then you could

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.680
have drive a car

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.519
into a girl and then get in she's like

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:41.120
oh whoa

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.120
that's awesome yeah that knocked me like

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.600
five feet sir

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.600
there were women who [ __ ] dudes who

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.959
got all around on horses

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:51.040
and then also dudes who drove cars in

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.000
their lifetime that's what i'm saying

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.959
dude wow

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:54.800
yeah some guy had to like they got in

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.160
the car and like wait where's this car

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.440
[ __ ] like it doesn't they're like what

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.200
this car doesn't [ __ ] we found out later

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.079
it's actually the sky

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:07.839
dude and then it's like you know they're

00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:09.440
like well how does it run it's like

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.000
gasoline why are you saying kerosene for

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.560
a while

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.160
you're probably probably like riding

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.000
around and bombs drilled out of crude

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
oil out of the middle of the earth yeah

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.079
now it blasts us across the [ __ ]

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:21.120
roads

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.680
terrifying no maybe not that's a no

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.519
that's a that's a leap that it's just

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:26.959
uncomfortable to care about

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:28.880
yeah man i guess that's the kind of

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.079
thing that you know every day you just

00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:31.600
ignore it well dude

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.880
i was reading this thing about an

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.800
anthropologist and he was talking about

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.639
he went to like another island he was a

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:38.399
french anthropologist went to another

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:39.040
island

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.160
and brought like the ideas of

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.320
christianity these people never even

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.440
heard of christianity didn't know what

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.399
it was

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:46.399
and uh i think like associated with

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:47.760
christianity is the idea that like your

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.440
soul is trapped in your body

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.880
so they never thought they they just

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.839
thought like their body and soul was

00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:53.199
like one thing so these guys brought

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.639
them christianity

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:56.880
and uh they're telling the guys like you

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.320
know how much did i definitely change

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.519
your [ __ ] up i told you about the soul

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:00.959
right the guy was like

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:02.800
no you actually just made me you [ __ ]

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.079
me up now because i think my soul's

00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:05.279
trapped in my body like i didn't realize

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:06.959
that a physical [ __ ] body dude

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:08.800
whoa i thought i was just soul material

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.160
and now i'm like this weird split and

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:10.800
half thing and

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.399
dude people were like kind of [ __ ] up

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:14.800
dude i don't

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.839
really like that you laid that

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:18.399
technology on me it's always silly

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.000
some white guys showed up to a bunch of

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.240
brown people and were like yo

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.279
did you know you have a soul inside your

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:26.720
body the basic properties and he was

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.040
like

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.320
we're [ __ ] bodies

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.839
christianity and all this stuff and they

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:33.600
were just like [ __ ]

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.320
dude yeah they were like he had like a

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.680
conversation with a guy who like was

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.199
there before it and then learned

00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:40.480
it was just kind of like yeah i mean it

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.680
was kind of it kind of [ __ ] me up to

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.279
think about it still but like

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:45.680
whoa yeah that's terrible it's pretty

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.959
crazy that is it's also

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:49.519
i mean i think like the the the the

00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:50.800
white guy at least like kind of about

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.120
like if you if you talk to somebody

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.040
you you introduce to them in your mind

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.800
you're introducing to them the idea of a

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.360
soul

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.600
being trapped inside a body and then you

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.839
find out like no no

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:03.360
we've been living as souls this whole

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.600
entire time you just

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.680
brought up the [ __ ] body idea exactly

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.040
like we weren't even thinking about the

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.480
body dude i would want to know more

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.199
about

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:13.360
like okay so all right my bad my bad

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.240
okay so

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.920
you tell me about the soul you know what

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.440
i mean it's like they know it's real

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.560
but then they say it you're like yeah i

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.560
want to watch a mumbo jumbo

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.760
it's like you [ __ ] retards

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.199
what's crazy is that it's not like

00:15:27.199 --> 00:15:29.120
that's not right what like there's no

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.480
way to quantify that you had a soul

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.440
stuck inside but

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.839
so what i'm saying is that like it's

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:35.519
crazy that that's like the point of view

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:36.240
that was like

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.079
oh this is the real one the other guy

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:39.759
was just like is that right

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:41.920
instead of like arguing like nah dude

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.440
that's not i don't have a soul stuck in

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.160
that you know what yeah

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.600
yeah but i think they hit him with some

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.440
science i think he's like grown-ups

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.480
he's like dude i think they did like

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.320
good thing he showed up what we did i

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.600
think they showed him like a

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.639
soda soda bottle volcano with like

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:56.560
thumbs up and they were like all right

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.800
well [ __ ] that's fine

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.240
yeah a little baking soda they got

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.399
dazzled i think so

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:03.519
i don't know i should have there was

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:05.120
like a thing that explained better how

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.050
they went about with their uh

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.560
[Laughter]

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:23.330
but yeah dude um

sucked into uh

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.440
a conversation on the way here by a

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.519
light-skinned latino fellow oh yeah

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:48.000
and uh so we're driving over here and i

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.120
was like you know let me

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.920
let me watch the news i was watching a

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.880
show i was actually

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.079
looking at like a little news story it's

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:55.680
not gonna lie i wanted some topics but

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.240
all i saw

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.399
shia labeouf was uh accused of beating

00:16:58.399 --> 00:17:00.320
his girlfriend pretty viciously

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.560
um you know which apparently he's beaten

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.799
allegedly a lot of his girlfriends

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:07.919
very viciously even like

00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:09.199
the one thing she complained about him

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:11.679
doing was like driving fast as [ __ ] and

00:17:11.679 --> 00:17:12.480
be like say you love

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.240
me or i'll kill us classic dudes

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.400
i mean it's old fashioned and it's like

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.000
i feel like there's a threshold you can

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.679
cross beating women where it's just like

00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:25.039
yeah that's just me

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:27.120
yeah this guy's retro from the 50s a lot

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.319
of his girls it was like i read the

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:28.960
fourth

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.559
case and was just like oh so this guy

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:31.760
just beats his girlfriend that's just

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.000
yeah

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.600
that's what this guy does i mean he

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.520
[ __ ] threatens normal like

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.160
60 70 years ago yeah well in some

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.360
cultures there's still trouble today i

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.320
don't think i don't think it's

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.760
good i don't think it's good but i think

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.520
it was normal i think in

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.320
latin x culture it's very acceptable to

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:46.880
beat

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.760
no to to uh at least um have your woman

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.640

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.840
sneaks through a small dagger

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.039

to know about it

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.440
um thank you but no so

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.799
yeah also i mean i was curious to how

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:38.720
that starts of just like just a little

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.440
like

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.720
i could start with like an elbow it's

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.240
just all out the box one night you just

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.400
wake up and you're just like

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.240
yeah you got to go out the box one night

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.600
and just see if they stay

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.799
i think i think you're like you

00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:54.320
slow cook them yeah you got to step them

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.360
down dude

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.400
i think you're right though because the

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.840
other shock could just be like that

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.640
didn't happen

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.400

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.280
kill his wife with one punch

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.880
you ever see what happens to a woman

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.640
when she gets contacted she's

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.640
blows off content definitely women

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.280
explode

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.280
every girl that gets knocked out in a

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.200
fight she hits the crown and gets right

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.600
back up like when you push a cat over it

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.120
i've never seen a woman get knocked out

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.480
in a fight and do like the fencing

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.919
response with their arms stuck out

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:26.080
true what they're trying to do is go

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.520
back to a time before they were knocked

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.760
down

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.919
[ __ ] but that that's why you got it

00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:38.799
that's why you got to go

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:41.760
full blast one day because then you can

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.679
like then in her mind it was like

00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:46.640
oh well i [ __ ] up like that i got it i

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.520

he likes spaghetti heated up in the pan

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.960
not the microwave

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.320
you know what i mean it could be like a

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.799
one one thing in her mind she's like oh

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:55.440
yeah i

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.080
i messed up i totally well i'm i'm

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.360
imagining something completely different

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.080
right now i'm sorry

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.840
yeah you're saying her rationalizing

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.200
getting [ __ ] like if you

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:07.360
one day like just like instead of like

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.320
building up to it

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.720
yeah you just like snap one day okay

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.159

00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:14.159
oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] up oh if you're just

00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:15.279
[ __ ] spazzed yeah if you just

00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:16.799
powerbombed her into a table one day

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:18.159

00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:19.360
use it one time

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.120
yeah you got to cash it in on something

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.480
like it's a genuine mistake

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.240
not to get like super sick but you have

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.520
to like wait for till she makes like a

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.240
genuinely

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.159
bad mistake and be like look look

00:24:30.159 --> 00:24:32.159

there

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.080
that's a that's dangerous because then

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.000
you have to like who that's who makes

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.039
the decision

00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:40.480
then you have to plead your case like

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.840
listen i think you just love the

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.200
threshold you need a team

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.960
yeah this alone you have the guy like

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.600
it's go time

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.240
just a light shot

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.640
you need like a panic button like

00:24:54.799 --> 00:24:57.200
oh man wait are you are you saying that

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.360
he would be like getting like

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.600
told how to hit his wife for sure i mean

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.720
you have a team dude if you're going to

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.039
plan

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:04.480
out if you're at ocean's eleven you're

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.679
talking about coaches do you have

00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:06.400
coaches like

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.600
sure go to the body yeah all right we

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.480
got her she's in the bed

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.640
we measured out you're about 57 feet

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.000
from the living room if you ran full

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.360
speed with your weight

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.720
184 pounds that's about uh 2 000 pounds

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.320
force

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.320
yeah you need a whole team dude these

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.760
scientists

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.679
you could not kill your wife one punch

00:25:27.679 --> 00:25:29.039
no i trust the scientists

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:30.640
it could be done it can be done it could

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.880
be done there was a guy one person died

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.679
in the uh

00:25:33.679 --> 00:25:35.200
in south philly he was like complaining

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.559
about someone else's dog and guy punched

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:37.679
him and he fell and hit his head and

00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:39.039
died

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:40.320
so you might have to install but that's

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.679
like it's not it was the probably the

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:42.480
fall that killed him

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.600
all right so maybe you got to get you

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.000
know tile floors concrete countertops

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.480
it's also he probably like he realized

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.039
that he was dude

00:25:53.679 --> 00:25:55.919
some of the bayonet going to uppercut

00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:57.840
her she's going to go through the floor

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.360
down into a room if you establish like a

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.480
mortal combat floor

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.640
or like just somebody falling from the

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.679
speed of an uppercut would break through

00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:10.240
[ __ ] dude that's how you'd have to do it

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.919
establish a mortal combat floor on the

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:12.640
third floor

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.320

around the car and went

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:01.760
and he was like he said something some

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.880
word in spanish

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.240
i remember it was something i remember

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.360
my brain going is one of the worst ones

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:35.840
you're like a racial slur sketch artist

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.039
and that's when he said it said what

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:03.120

though it was it was it was a muddled

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.159
the dude was a man

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:16.480
yeah so obviously he's in a traffic

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.440
situation

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.360
it's obviously everybody else's fault so

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.039
i'm like driving as

00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:22.720

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.279
dealing with and i was down today when i

00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:28.720
had to pick up these three black lights

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.080
down to south philly for 20 bucks

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.799
off that guy that's the only way you can

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:34.159
buy they don't sell black lights in

00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:35.919
stores you have to buy them from someone

00:28:35.919 --> 00:28:37.279
for 20 bucks yeah

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:42.559
for sure for sure you got to know

00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:44.960
you got to go

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:50.960
i was when i was picking up the black

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.360
lights i go i pull up the house in south

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.159
philly

00:28:54.159 --> 00:28:56.480
and there was a there was a sinus that

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.600
black lives matter so i started trying

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.559
to racially profile

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.919
brother has this [ __ ]

00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:51.760
and this is exactly how the condition

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.880
his would be in if he

00:30:04.559 --> 00:30:05.840
excavate them there's probably more

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.919
light underneath this layer of teeth

00:30:07.919 --> 00:30:09.760
there's just like a film of just like

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.080
fallen dabs of just like the

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.320

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.520
type of dude that like

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.760
friends older sisters are always dating

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.559

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.080
of dudes yeah

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.159
when you're a kid yeah yeah yeah this

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:30.399
guy always for sure 100 i can verify

00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:31.200
that i knew somebody

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.120
they act like he like acts cool around

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.720
kids yeah i mean i was

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.840
open the door to a white guy with

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.159
dreadlocks and was like

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:40.480
i can't stop thinking about how like

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.440
systemic

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.640
when you were like wondering if he was a

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.320
black guy yeah like the idea of it being

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.320
systemic and that black people can only

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.279
use black lights and sell black lights

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:50.240
that'd be pretty sick

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.000
oh if they were oh dude because like it

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.840
kind of tracks things around people like

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.960
hey that's unfair yeah

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.240
because they're like white people use it

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.679
to seem cool you know what i mean it's

00:30:57.679 --> 00:30:58.000
still

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.240
so tragic well there's like uh you don't

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.200
know this but

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.240
there are like different uh light bands

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.080
on the spectrum that only human puppies

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.480
can see

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:11.760
a little history that's why human

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.480
puppies

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.960
make so much club music they love the

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.679
club

00:31:15.679 --> 00:31:18.000
cuban puppies love the club there's dog

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.120
whistling and human puppy lighting

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.640
that'd be funny to do a uh like a

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.600
diversity talk somewhere and just like

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.840
set up like a bunch of crazy stereotypes

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.799
about black people strictly use black

00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:31.760
light like

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.440

because you know how you guys feel about

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:34.880
that

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.919
you guys will judge us but yeah we're

00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:37.279
strictly black lightning strictly black

00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:38.240
light strictly black

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.919

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.079
listen the worst drivers on the planet

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:01.520
but that was the thing i'm like oh [ __ ]

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.200
i'm in a racist conversation like [ __ ]

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.440
but then i was also in a car with a

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.839
black woman just before i got done

00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:09.599
yeah and i was like but i was more so

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:12.079
suffering a black woman passenger which

00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:13.680
i think is just a woman passenger

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.680
yo uh black black women driving

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.200
aggressively driving in the passenger

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.800
seat i'm like dude i'm not passing it

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.200
yet

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.240
dude just [ __ ] go i'll go around this

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.680

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.280
oh yeah you can i'm like dude shut the

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.839
[ __ ] up

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.520
black women drive the same way black

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.040
women work at fast food places

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.200
police elaborate uh

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.640
here here we go here we go right

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.119
so again let me restate my thesis

00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:49.680
black women drive the same way black

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.240
women work at fast food places which is

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.359
[ __ ] all the white people at this job

00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:57.599
[ __ ] these white people [ __ ] all these

00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:59.040
white people on this road

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.480
that would make sense why every time i

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.800
order [ __ ] i go to fast food

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.079

unearthed the jewel i think so i thought

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.720
that you unearthed the jewel man it was

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.440
like that was

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.040
let's welcome the stoner dads welcome

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.839

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.320
eyes this whole entire time

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.720
that was nice that was the uh that was

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.160
the conversation i was like

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.480
[ __ ] dude this guy's being racist right

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.599
now and i was like i don't want to be

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:46.880
rude

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.119

00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:50.000

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:54.560
anything bad he was like man black women

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.599

00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:58.640
and i was like yeah yeah they do i can

00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.520
attest to that

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.839
and they always go like um excuse me

00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:05.839
jose

00:38:05.839 --> 00:38:07.839
more black women i was like okay jose

00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:08.960
this is a crazy

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.480
crazy thing that's happening has nothing

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.280
to do another okay you know what

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.839
jose yeah you should have stopped them

00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:16.720
immediately

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.920
like i'm not gonna let you talk about my

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.079
black queens like that true

00:38:20.079 --> 00:38:23.040
even though they all have a dent in the

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.480
front driver side of the car from

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.079
aggressive driving

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:27.839
that was not their fault somebody

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:29.680
stopped jose

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.480
yeah the um it was funny it was funny to

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.000
get caught up in that and then to try to

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.440
rationalize it be like well technically

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.800
we're having like more of a conversation

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.240
about physics

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.040
like speed distance it's like black

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.930
women time speed

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:44.640
[Laughter]

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.119
just another

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.040
[Laughter]

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.720
divided by black women squared oh [ __ ]

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.760
true that is a factor yeah you need to

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.599
do like a die like a davinci diagram of

00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:09.840
like the angle of the seat it's like

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.680
[Laughter]

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.640
although i feel like black women don't

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.920
typically very very good posture

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.079
right in 90 dude yeah that's something i

00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:22.079
punch that's like that's why black men

00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:23.359
we tilt our seats back because we're

00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:24.960
trying to differentiate ourselves true

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.000
you guys because

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.839
yeah right now we're not then i want it

00:39:27.839 --> 00:39:29.520
dude i want it so hard to be comfortable

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.280
with my seat super far back but it just

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.800
feels like a strain on my stomach when i

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.079
do it

00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:35.520
because you're not fully relaxed those

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.760
are true relax your core

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.119
you don't have the extra muscles

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.680
because you're like you're like if i

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.440
lean back too far i won't be able to see

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:47.760
the

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.599
road but you can if you just get it to

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:51.280
the correct angle and fully relax your

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.160
core yeah

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.040
he's trying to not slip out of the seat

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:55.440
dude

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.800
that's been something i've been like no

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.880
i can lean back and i lean back and i'm

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.000
like i'm not comfortable

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.320
i'm not comfortable like this oh man i

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.359
just sit i'm like

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:04.640
let me go back another notch and i'm

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.160
like nah man i like to be up high and

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.359
tight on the seat dude

00:40:07.359 --> 00:40:08.880
so it's so funny to imagine everyone

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.880
you've ever seen drive slow lean back

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.599
their whole time they're

00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:12.800
just thinking about how uncomfortable it

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.880
is and they hate it that guy looks so

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.400
[ __ ] cool he's just like [ __ ] man

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:24.640
[ __ ] dude my stomach's on fire

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.880
i mean you a lot of black people always

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.720
have sick abs skinny black people sure

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.560
they lean back in their cars

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.680
they always have abs for no reason

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.440
abs i can bring this mic up to me

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.040
but yeah no i i've tried that's

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.160
something i've been like that'd be

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.359
something i can incorporate and be like

00:40:41.359 --> 00:40:42.800
no it's just i just leaned back a little

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.839
guys what the hell yeah

00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:45.280
don't judge me yeah leaning back i

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.599
always drove like that move yeah

00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:50.960
i think if almost any definitely you two

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.040
almost any grown man in my life if they

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.319
suddenly started bleeding back in their

00:40:54.319 --> 00:40:57.520
car be like what are you doing

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.040
who do you think you are well as a white

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.480
male what what what is the like

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.920
acceptable degree would you say

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:15.040
[Laughter]

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.319
i don't want you [ __ ] in a neutral or

00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:19.920
weak position while you're driving the

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.520
cops pull you over you're just going

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:27.440
to do that set your airbags off

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.599
are you leaning back like no no i could

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:33.200
have sworn you at 130 degrees there

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.599
yeah i wonder how i can get like i think

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:41.200
two clicks before someone is like

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.280
what the [ __ ] you doing what are you

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.280
doing yeah i'd be like are you injured

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.760
in some way

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.720
yeah you would definitely need to be

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.079
like if you had if you would have to

00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:55.839
have a do-rag on to be able to pass

00:41:55.839 --> 00:41:58.000
true as a white guy with the ceiling

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.880
back

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.000
true i could start sagging too something

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.680
if i started sagging you that would be

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.119
so [ __ ] cool

00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:06.400
but you'd have to up your box as a

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.319
fashion statement i could say i can make

00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:09.680
no i just you know that'd be cool to be

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.160
known for all your your funny boxers

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.000
right now i've seen i've seen people

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.520
like say i

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.800
this is something i was talking about

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.079
funny i'm talking about this on romas

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:18.560
it's like

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.440
as a as a dude you have to stop being

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.400
cool

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.800
in order to be cool as you get older

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.680
totally agree

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.800
you know what i mean if you try to be

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.520
too cool for too long it inverts on you

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.000
but if you

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.400
like let go of coolness it you just you

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.760
lose it for like five years or so and it

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.480
goes

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.400
it fly flies back onto you they're

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.920
giving away the secret right now

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.920
true well they still won't be able to do

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.680
it what like

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.839
it's just hard to let go true it's hard

00:42:43.839 --> 00:42:45.280
it's hard to let go if you've never had

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.079
the cool

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:47.599
then you just turn into an old nerd

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:49.680
which must be like

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.160
yeah i actually you know i don't i would

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.119
never even

00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:55.359
i don't even think in those terms you

00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:56.800
know what i mean what

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.440

cost you 37

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.520
at acme that's a big move for dudes who

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.599
were like all about motorcycles when

00:44:59.599 --> 00:45:00.640
like

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.400
uh orange county choppers and [ __ ] came

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.079
out but never owned a motorcycle like

00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:06.000
they wore motorcycle t-shirts and [ __ ]

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
rules but never had a bike that's who

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.920
those dudes are now

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.880
ah [ __ ] yeah you're saying who went too

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.680
cool

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.880
yeah yeah yeah they took a shortcut and

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.839
that's where that's the

00:45:17.839 --> 00:45:20.079
that's like the pitfall like when you

00:45:20.079 --> 00:45:21.599
take the shortcut to just being the

00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:25.440
the t-shirt motorcycle guy without like

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.119
owning the bike or like ever riding one

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:28.079
you know what i mean that's like the

00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:29.280
ultimate

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.960
the dude just identified something cool

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.480
and attached himself to it so you

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.040
overshoot that and then you end up in

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.720
[ __ ] territory but you gotta cop a

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.160
bike at some point dude

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.200
i'm talking about two different things

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.240
i'm talking about people well yeah i

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.680
guess you're right i'm thinking about

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.839
being fashion cool

00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:46.160
because if you're fashion cool that that

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.359
is certain same thing

00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:48.960
yeah that's fashion cool and uh yeah

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.960
it's just twister directions instead of

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.560
fashion you're like i'm gonna motor i'm

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.400
into the idea of motorcycles

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.839
yeah that would be pretty sick though if

00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:57.280
someone could just own that dude i'm

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.200
really into the idea of motorcycles

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.000
yeah but i love the gear also too with

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.680
the right people that's fashion cool

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.839
you know like right oh harley shirt yeah

00:46:05.839 --> 00:46:06.800
people went on a harley shirt and

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.000
they're like let's go

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.599
my step my stepmom's in a biker game

00:46:11.599 --> 00:46:14.000
that was like when i was 14 and if i got

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.240
a bud light shirt i'm like

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.280
people don't know what the [ __ ] i'm

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.359
about dude yeah yeah bud light come on

00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:20.640
how'd i even get my hands on this dude

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.160
i'm 14.

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.240
yeah they just ride they just ride sick

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.680
bikes around

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.599
know about beer yeah i have a beard

00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:29.119
t-shirt

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:31.359
i have four beers under my bed that i've

00:46:31.359 --> 00:46:32.960
been saving

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.560
so you're talking about she's in a

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.640
motorcycle gang yeah they got like

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.800
leather vests and [ __ ] that all match

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.040
like their logo on it

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.440
i think it is i think it's kind of uh is

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.240
it disappointing

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.880
is it a black chick bike gang nah it's

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.720
like uh

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.359
i guess it's ethnically mixed and uh

00:46:51.359 --> 00:46:52.160
that's not good

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.920
it's also co-ed it's a co-ed it's a code

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.200
yeah it's a co-ed

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.720
it's a co-ed bike game yeah what that's

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.480
a bad sign

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.359
it's just just sons of unity basically

00:47:01.359 --> 00:47:02.640
it's basically just like

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.839
like people over 50 that like [ __ ]

00:47:05.839 --> 00:47:08.000
hot rods and bikes

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.920
and they just ride around loving bikes

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.280
no that seems too obvious i think

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.720
they're at they're probably act like

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.000
that and they're probably

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.839
secretly the most they're all that guy

00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:17.200
who owns the chicken place from breaking

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:17.710
bad

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:21.760
[Laughter]

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.760
it's wild as [ __ ] dude i mean i could

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.599
see it my stepmom she was she was wild

00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:26.319
back in the day

00:47:26.319 --> 00:47:28.800
my stepmom and my mom are like two sides

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.400
of the same coin like the black side of

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.720
the noise

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.720
really yeah they're very similar uh very

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:37.920
very similar and very different at the

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.079
same time but they're both wild

00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:43.040
they were both wild women huh that would

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:43.280
be

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.200
they'd be great like i don't know

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.839
i i had a so stupid i was just imagining

00:47:50.839 --> 00:47:52.000
cartoons

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.200
like that's that's always like the

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.040
classic like

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.480
you haven't having two moms like a black

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.839
lives matter siblings and one of them's

00:47:57.839 --> 00:47:58.880
like ultimate

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.240
powerful in one direction you know what

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.680
i mean yeah god i love that kind of [ __ ]

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.960
i'm lost you're talking about like an

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.440
archetypal like mom who's a good

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.680
what well he's he's breaking down a lot

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.559
of things yeah what the hell are you

00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:11.359
talking about

00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:13.760
yeah so your mom and your mom and your

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.200
sister being like

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.319
my mom hurt yeah

00:48:18.319 --> 00:48:20.000
yeah said there are two sides of the

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.440
same coin

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.119
yeah like the they're like the good guy

00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:24.480
in the bad guy and like the cartoon that

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.400
like have the opposite powers and

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.079
yeah they got a showdown really yeah

00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:29.599
yeah they were they weren't they weren't

00:48:29.599 --> 00:48:30.480
showdown though

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.640
they would like show up with each other

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.880
and then like get banned from places

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.480
really oh they team they with their

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.400
powers combined yes their power is

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.520
understand what i'm saying though like

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.319
the whole

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:44.240
the whole [ __ ] cartoon is us trying

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.520
to keep them away from each other

00:48:53.119 --> 00:48:56.240
yeah it's awesome it is it is they they

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.119
do they're

00:48:57.119 --> 00:48:58.240
because they used to when they were

00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.760
young they used to grow like they came

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.559
up

00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:02.480
as friends they were they would jump

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.319
people together nice

00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:06.880

you'll never change imagine dude that'd

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.720
be wild if you're a dude

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.400
like it's like like they just show up

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.760
like on either side

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.920
fighting a guy didn't even know you were

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.160

i'm also thinking i'm just thinking

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.839
about the dude to have to be like

00:49:53.839 --> 00:49:55.040
imagine if your

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.800

current bay

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.040

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.920
a movie dude

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.359
yeah it was more like i think it was

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:25.359
more like um my mom

00:50:25.359 --> 00:50:26.720
so then they like split apart because of

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.040
moving and [ __ ] my mom and my stepmom

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:29.680
talking about

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.960
but then like my mom got with my dad

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.880
and then stopping with my dad and my

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.079
stepmom got with my dad

00:50:36.079 --> 00:50:38.400
so it was more like if you didn't tell

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.000
me not to be with him more than like you

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:40.559

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.680
how did you let me get with this

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:44.720
[ __ ] i wonder what that

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.559

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.040
just like every time so

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.160
every time i would get dropped off

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.440
like they would like hang out and talk

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.200
for a little while beforehand and they

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:57.680

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.000
talk [ __ ] on my dad that's all they did

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.119
was just like he does

00:51:01.119 --> 00:51:03.520
like this he still does this phone call

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.119

yeah handling multi i don't know how

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.760
people did that man when they would have

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.240
like like

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.839
mormons have like multiple wives that

00:51:17.839 --> 00:51:19.280
would just be turned into like a [ __ ]

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.880
hall of mirrors after a while

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.240
let's go into one room going to another

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.839
one get your head warped again being

00:51:23.839 --> 00:51:24.480
like

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.400
wait what but i mean you got to keep

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.000
them separated you got to keep the women

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.119
separated or they will [ __ ]

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:32.000
like women cannot not try to rise up

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:32.880
against

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.520
the man so if you put if they start

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.280
talking to each other

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.040

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.160
they'll kill you they'll murder they'll

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.359
do something

00:51:41.359 --> 00:51:42.559
they'll start plotting against you

00:51:42.559 --> 00:51:44.240
immediately like the more women in one

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.760
space the more evil the plan is

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.319

definitely that's uh

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.480
i've definitely gotten some battles with

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.400
especially um

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.200
muslim black ladies driving i've got bad

i'm not gonna like chase on kelly drive

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.799
high speeds

00:55:48.799 --> 00:55:51.359
yeah we exchanged taunts and then she

00:55:51.359 --> 00:55:51.839
[ __ ]

00:55:51.839 --> 00:55:53.440
i was like [ __ ] this and she like was

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.359
coming up on me so i [ __ ] gunned it

00:55:55.359 --> 00:55:56.960
we like raced down kelly drive

00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.480
once we got into center city we got that

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.559
light uh right where it pours off onto

00:56:00.559 --> 00:56:02.480
the parkway we both just looked at each

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.680
other and we're like

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.200
and just drove away that's the only time

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.440
a woman is scary because she has a

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:07.920
vehicle

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.359
it's like it's like back fighting and

00:56:09.359 --> 00:56:12.319
veil yeah it was like ford explorer

00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:13.839
dude i had a little my little you know

00:56:13.839 --> 00:56:15.680
so you can't even get a read on her like

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:16.960
you can't even kind of like make out

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.920
what kind of person she called me a

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.119
white piece of [ __ ]

00:56:19.119 --> 00:56:20.960
weird like you [ __ ] white piece of

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:22.799
[ __ ] right [ __ ] you [ __ ] and she was

00:56:22.799 --> 00:56:23.680
like

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.200
she was fast she's like how dare you

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.680
[ __ ] yeah and then you like mutually

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.520
part of ways like when you both realize

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:30.720
that you know

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.720
from a distance nobody can really tell

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.079
who the owner is

00:56:34.079 --> 00:56:37.200
true true in a uh

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.960
you know my answer to she was like

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.480
[ __ ] up uh i was like well i'm gonna

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.000
drive as fast as i can right now

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.079
and she was like well so am i so i'm not

00:56:44.079 --> 00:56:45.040
going to let you win and

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.040
[ __ ] beat me in this race so we just

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.880
[ __ ] raced out of anger

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.720
yeah it was tight dude what car did you

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.160
have back then i had honda civics

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.920
it was the one that got totaled by

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.200
somebody hitting your own car

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.640
yeah this is actually this is what this

00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.000
is controversial and you're not even

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.040
supposed to say this

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.280
right because it's like i i'm not saying

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:02.400
something racist i'm saying something

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.079
like against racism but they still don't

00:57:04.079 --> 00:57:04.960
like it but

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.040
i think goomba owns come in every color

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.400
100

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.640
100 they they hate it when you say that

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.160
but it's one of those things that's true

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:12.720
anyway

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.319
that might be the cure to invent new

00:57:14.319 --> 00:57:15.839
slurs that like trans

00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:17.599
like more inclusive slurs

00:57:17.599 --> 00:57:19.599
trans-inclusive slurs yes

00:57:19.599 --> 00:57:21.760
that's a good idea that's all i've been

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:22.640
trying to do

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.720
dude that's all we like like anthony and

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.960
i have

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.359
economists like we can't have one world

00:57:37.359 --> 00:57:41.839
of government dude yeah

i want to say one of the bachelors

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.520

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.040
race has some guy like that and then i

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.240
say goomba round

00:58:15.119 --> 00:58:15.760
mentos

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.359
rather than like screaming out your car

00:58:17.359 --> 00:58:18.559
a slur while someone does something

00:58:18.559 --> 00:58:20.799
you're like

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.799
like the freeze frame was like yeah

this commercial no no no no no

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.760
jim if everyone in memphis commercials

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:32.640
was interrupting

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:37.839
saying the n word

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.640
oh [ __ ] that would be weird if that was

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:42.160
what happened i mean it'd be

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.079
that wouldn't be good i tell you what i

00:58:44.079 --> 00:58:47.040
wouldn't buy any more goddamn mentos

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.720
whoa this advertising campaign doesn't

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.720
appeal to me at all

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.799
i'm shutting this off they're exploiting

00:58:52.799 --> 00:58:55.359
a [ __ ] underrepresented community

00:58:55.359 --> 00:58:58.079
you want white inward sayers the

00:58:58.079 --> 00:58:59.920
community of whitehead

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.440
i don't agree with those mentos brother

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.880
when they meet each other they're like

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.680
oh sweet

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:09.680
nobody says it anymore brother

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.160
yeah not all white people that's like

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.599
the joke right that all white people

00:59:13.599 --> 00:59:14.079
like

00:59:14.079 --> 00:59:16.240
they check to see if you can say n word

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.520
with each other

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.280
that's very funny that's not true but

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.040
there are definitely dudes who are like

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.400
trying to see who's good with the end

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.760
of it i've had people on construction

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.440
sites hit me up for sure or like they

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:26.880
would corner me because i was in the

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.640
union so like it was for the most part

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.839
is meet a bunch of black dudes and then

00:59:29.839 --> 00:59:31.440
like there would be a white laborer not

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:32.799
all the times but like

00:59:32.799 --> 00:59:34.079
a couple times they come up and they get

00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:35.520
you and them alone they're like you

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:36.400
believe you're working with all these

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.520
[ __ ] and they start like going

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.280
on these hard and you're just like

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.839
whoa and every every time the first time

00:59:41.839 --> 00:59:44.000
uh one of those dudes says the n-word to

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:44.799
you

00:59:44.799 --> 00:59:47.440
they they kind of pause for a second

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.480
almost like

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.640
it's not long but they're like they they

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.640
drop it and then you know

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.720
they're reading you they're waiting and

00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.160
it's like they just gave you a gift and

00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.440
they want to see a reaction

00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.799
like did you open it

01:00:00.799 --> 01:00:02.319
what do you think of me give it a listen

01:00:02.319 --> 01:00:04.000
let me know what you think oh dude

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.520
it's very quick they condensed that

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.119
feeling into like a very brief

01:00:07.119 --> 01:00:10.079
yeah there is a uh this guy actually i

01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:11.440
didn't like this guy at all and i

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.200
definitely uh i made him i was like i

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.240
used to [ __ ] with him all the time

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.760
because he he said the first time he was

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.400
like

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.760
he didn't hit me with the n word but he

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.760
hit me with like a i forget what the

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.359
word was but he was like

01:00:21.359 --> 01:00:22.799
very not pleased with working with a

01:00:22.799 --> 01:00:24.480
bunch of black dudes and the guy i would

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.200
work with

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.040
i know what the word was that's

01:00:32.559 --> 01:00:34.880
i don't know what it was but like on

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.079
construction sites uh

01:00:36.079 --> 01:00:38.160
like construction workers are a big fan

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.079
of the porch monkey

01:00:40.079 --> 01:00:41.839
something like that yeah he was italian

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:43.119
too so yeah

01:00:43.119 --> 01:00:45.520
yeah like when they say him like one of

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.240
those like

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.480
words in cursive like a bunch of monk no

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.240
yeah they still say like

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.480
yeah sure yeah but yeah he came up and

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.680
there the one guy uh

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.640
wait can you say that no dude you can't

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.839
say that all right unless you're a

01:00:57.839 --> 01:00:58.960
talent like even

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.079
you know just you know if you're italian

01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:03.119
i think you can but

01:01:03.119 --> 01:01:04.720
the point of the story was the guy

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.240
trapped me in kind of like a

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.839
brother how will you handle this and

01:01:07.839 --> 01:01:09.280
there's

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.200
the dude that i was cool with uh me and

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.640
him had a sick business arrangement at

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.920
the time where like

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.440
he would like whatever he would say the

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.160
n word and i would play him

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.200
i had like i had this like little

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.040
construction site midi operation going

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:26.400

01:01:44.559 --> 01:01:48.319
in the front man

01:01:48.319 --> 01:01:49.839

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:52.400
guys i had the opportunity to alert a

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.920

among us dude i was just among us

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.240

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.039
before pc culture so

01:03:19.039 --> 01:03:20.240

it on each other in class me and my

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.359
friends were telling each other in class

01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:25.039
and it was so [ __ ] fun

01:03:25.039 --> 01:03:27.760
like pat's leaning back in his chair

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.359
yeah but you guys would have still been

01:03:29.359 --> 01:03:30.000
mad if someone

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.480
you doing to each other like all right

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.480
it is fun it is funny i always have

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.000
thought it was funny when people corner

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.200
you and they're like

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.839
wanna be racist

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.280

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.880
just waiting he was like oh sweet

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.799
yo let's do that thing i think i got

01:03:52.799 --> 01:03:54.640
what it takes wow let's do that

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.000
let's do that thing yeah

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.359

01:03:59.359 --> 01:04:01.200
talk thing you're just kind of feeling

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.240
down you're like

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.839
that's how white people get up for the

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:05.440
morning to work no

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.799
i think that's why i think it comes from

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:09.359
i think it's one thing we just go like

01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:10.880
you know where you just you're feeling

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.160
kind of down on yourself and then you're

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.280
just like

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.839
i think i'm better than all black people

01:04:15.839 --> 01:04:17.280
all latinos jews

or is it cause he's in like a digital

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.960
afterlife so he's like his his like

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.400

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:28.719
like

he was such a sweet lady to this this

01:08:37.199 --> 01:08:38.000
lady who was actually

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.159
still in the living life she was like

01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:41.440
his customer service representative that

like rotating the letters

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.199
yeah that's true i think about it it's

01:09:13.199 --> 01:09:14.799
all code you think you would

01:09:14.799 --> 01:09:16.640

yeah you get here to do what's best for

01:10:53.199 --> 01:10:54.800
the group true that makes the cult

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.520
stronger though

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.000
if when it's a prohibitive cult that's

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.600
when things start to turn

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.360
like a conscious call yeah that's almost

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.880

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.320
story he's like i mean i've been in the

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.080
pyramids probably like nine times

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.719
in the secret chamber of mana houth and

01:18:56.719 --> 01:18:58.000
not a lot of people have been down there

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.199

01:18:59.199 --> 01:19:00.800
the guy was like wait did you guys slide

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.640
down that's a pretty easy i mean i climb

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.760
when i go to they're like

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.120
one up in each other on like secret

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.560
chambers oh they're definitely both

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.360
making it up

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.040
oh dude i mean maybe i don't know if it

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.480
exists or not but they're just they're

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.920

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:12.400
like

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.840
i mean i've been down that hill i guess

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.120
i guess that was steep the first time i

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.320
went down there but yeah i just kind of

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.840

01:19:19.679 --> 01:19:20.640
only one that's not real you're an

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.520
outsider the rest of them are

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:22.159
role-playing

01:19:22.159 --> 01:19:23.840
it's like a universe they've built where

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.760
they're all like explorers

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.960

it wasn't going to happen that might be

01:19:43.679 --> 01:19:46.719
why they built the pyramids

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.800

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.920
irreparable schism for the rest of my

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.120
grades how faulty are

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.800
memories dude that whole thing probably

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.000
didn't even happen that i was talking

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.250
about that was super embarrassing

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.719
way no matter what you do it's like i

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:05.040

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.800
the human memory is super unreliable

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.639
fragile constructs if you ask those guys

01:22:08.639 --> 01:22:09.840
they'd all have different versions of

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.639

were you wearing the referee stripes

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.320
when you put the dick out

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.920
i have the power you just blew a whistle

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.679
i might as well been i might as i mean

01:25:37.679 --> 01:25:40.159
it was definitely yeah two jobs

01:25:40.159 --> 01:25:41.520
it was two but it was just i just didn't

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.960
like who i was and where i was at the

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:43.520
time

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:46.000
yeah and it was just like well let me

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.080

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.199
you know my dick whoa yeah life's not my

01:25:51.199 --> 01:25:53.280

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.639
let's see what you know let's see what's

01:25:54.639 --> 01:25:55.840
up with my dick yeah cause it was like

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.199

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.880
world yeah you know what

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:01.840
it makes sense i think that's a thought

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:02.880
that goes to everyone said before they

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.320
expose their genitals yeah if you could

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.600
go like no i think i rule

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.760
yeah you don't need to see this what

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.199
you're saying makes sense because when

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:12.960
you whenever you see like uh

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.719
like latinx and egyptian like mall kiosk

01:26:16.719 --> 01:26:18.560

you know forwardly but like gently

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.000
asking to touch women's wrists and

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.199
elbows and stuff like that

01:26:29.199 --> 01:26:30.560
yeah that's crazy like they're just like

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.080
yeah this is who i am i mean that's like

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.520
a skill like being an electrician or a

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.239
plumber

01:26:34.239 --> 01:26:35.679
there's years of apprenticeship that go

01:26:35.679 --> 01:26:36.960
into like excuse me i'm just getting

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:37.920
yeah

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:39.040

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.520
the [ __ ] off yeah the [ __ ] are you doing

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.880
people are like oh i'm sorry you can't

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:44.880
touch my arm right now yeah they spend

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.480
weeks with their faces just in like a

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:48.000
vice and they're learning how to do that

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.560
first eye contact

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.840
where it's like you're not you're not

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:54.080
alarmed but you're also not compelled

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.760
but all they needed was for you to let

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:57.120
your guard down for a second and then

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:57.920
they pull

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:00.239
yeah i mean it takes them years to

01:27:00.239 --> 01:27:01.440
master that [ __ ] man

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.040

that's where i was

01:28:50.239 --> 01:28:52.239

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.280
it was okay while i'm down here i might

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.120
as well be the [ __ ] man true you know

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.639
but basically that's what it was and it

01:29:06.639 --> 01:29:08.159
was like kicked out of college rules

01:29:08.159 --> 01:29:09.440
dude

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.120
i mean it was the way i got kicked out

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.800
of college what kind of metric were you

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.159
using to declare yourself in the middle

01:29:14.159 --> 01:29:15.040
do you think you're better than

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.159
better than bodily dude better you

01:29:16.159 --> 01:29:18.320
didn't go to college yeah i mean well he

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.280
also didn't get kicked out

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:24.239
true yeah

01:29:24.239 --> 01:29:27.199
uh again just in what way were you like

01:29:27.199 --> 01:29:28.480
what warped part

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:30.000
way did you think you were killing it

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.520
like dude i'm getting so much [ __ ]

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.400
right now

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.800
you know what i mean basically yeah get

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.320
get getting a lot of [ __ ]

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:40.159
that's really i mean it was like

01:29:40.159 --> 01:29:42.239
if if i'm gonna be this i might as well

01:29:42.239 --> 01:29:44.000
be getting [ __ ] like if i'm gonna be a

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.760
dude that gets kicked out of college and

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.840
and has to come back to his hometown

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.800
and work two jobs you know like i might

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.080
as well be watching this might be the

01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:53.120
coolest thing i've ever heard that's

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:56.639
real waterbed energy by the way

01:29:58.639 --> 01:30:01.440
like look i need this yeah i almost got

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:02.560
a lava lamp

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.840
i was at that point almost got to be

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.480
fair to be fair at 19

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:09.120
i was like getting [ __ ] so that i

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:09.840
didn't die

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:11.760
if that made sense like i was the same

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.280
way like i had to justify myself you

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.560
need to know you were alive by getting

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.800
[ __ ] yeah

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.719
that was all i would be like i cannot

01:30:18.719 --> 01:30:20.080
wait to tell everyone i got [ __ ]

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:22.320
yeah it was awesome but in my head i was

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:23.360
like was that the part that you liked

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.560
the most was telling them about it

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.080
pretty much [ __ ] rules but telling

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:28.000
people about getting [ __ ] when i was 19

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.440
you'd be like what did you last night i

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.840

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.960
and stuff that like come with oxytocin

01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:41.120
from like touching another human being

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.440
but like dude i was like so if it felt

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.719

so we were like breaking it out on

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.280
holidays

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:31.119
a nice sweater but you opened a very

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:33.679
nice cupboard to let it out

01:36:33.679 --> 01:36:36.239
my mom definitely made it clear that we

01:36:36.239 --> 01:36:36.719
were

01:36:36.719 --> 01:36:39.600
we were not going to be tossing that

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.560
word around

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.719
in our house yeah but we were the type

01:36:42.719 --> 01:36:45.040
of people to be tossing that word around

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.800
really yeah like that that was like our

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.360
family we were definitely inwards

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:52.800
you know she toppled like an empire

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.560

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:04.000
yeah i think it is like it's almost

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.440
because i feel like it stifles so much

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.040

just not saying it but

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:24.800

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:27.119
around it yeah i see i see those

01:37:27.119 --> 01:37:29.119

the treasure tracks

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:15.600

[Laughter]

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:35.840

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.040
are you saying that's what native

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:38.960
american scouts were back then it worked

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:40.960
for them

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:42.239
yeah they shortened it actually it was

01:44:42.239 --> 01:44:44.180
originally sacks

01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:47.440
[Laughter]

01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:59.679

01:45:25.199 --> 01:45:26.560
popular part apocalypto

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:27.840
you know they sneak into the village

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.140
rather than lighting on fire like

01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:37.840
[Laughter]

there had to obey the tribe that was

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.480
like look if we just go for their dicks

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:08.480

01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.560
against that

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.320
yeah what's it called there's another

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:15.280
really because you can grab someone's

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:17.280
ankle so you technically

01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.800
there's no below the belt and just here

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.920
you grab their ankle technically you can

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:21.280
grab their dick is that a foul

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:23.280
i think they they specify genitals in

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:24.880
the rules do they really yeah you also

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:26.480
can't grab the visual finger

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.760
do you know that what happened you can't

01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:30.159
grab an individual finger really

01:46:30.159 --> 01:46:31.520
yeah you just break the finger really

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:33.520
quick yeah that's that's in competition

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:34.960
which like in a real fight you could

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.560
fight through a broken finger

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.639
true yeah but in a competition it's

01:46:38.639 --> 01:46:40.000
almost like all right well now

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.159
the game's over because you [ __ ] just

01:46:42.159 --> 01:46:43.520
easily snap someone's finger

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.040

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:11.920
said

01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:13.520
this has probably happened tons of times

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:14.960
people actually touching his dick

01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:16.080
i guess he thought i'd realize my

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.159
mistake and let go i didn't i try and

01:48:18.159 --> 01:48:20.080

as handhold

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:24.639
whoa his reaction was as you'd expect

01:48:24.639 --> 01:48:26.560
rolling after that was rather subdued he

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.719
was holding back a smile after class

01:48:28.719 --> 01:48:30.080
what the [ __ ]

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:32.480
yeah that's i don't know that was a

01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:34.080
weird amount of detail for a story that

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.400
didn't need to be told

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:39.440
yeah yeah yeah dude that's erotica that

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:40.320

like he didn't realize he pulled him

01:48:44.639 --> 01:48:47.280
he pulled himself he like got positioned

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:49.040
definitely

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:51.440
he dragged him dude and then he said the

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.280
match was subdued after that like what

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:54.239

he felt about the encounter

01:48:58.719 --> 01:49:01.679
did he like it time would tell but in

01:49:01.679 --> 01:49:03.360
the moment he was mostly confused

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:06.000
oh my god dude that would be the most

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.760
heinous type of like serial killer if

01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:08.960
you're just like you joined a jiu jitsu

01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:09.840
place you chilled

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.119
it's like my plan from before like

01:49:11.119 --> 01:49:13.040
pretending to sleepwalk so you just like

01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:14.719
[ __ ] rail just beat your wife or

01:49:14.719 --> 01:49:17.199

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.719
oh man but yeah so wow dude this is

01:49:34.719 --> 01:49:36.800
we caught a nice little pocket here yeah

01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:38.239
there's a few pockets

01:49:38.239 --> 01:49:39.840
a few pockets yeah we should start soon

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.840
yeah let's start this up

01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:47.040
um this is actually so this is an idea i

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:47.599
want to

01:49:47.599 --> 01:49:49.840
have you guys here it's an idea i want

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:51.119
to work out on you

01:49:51.119 --> 01:49:54.719
um so right now i'm doing the uh

01:49:54.719 --> 01:49:57.679
logo therapy modules for psychnol i'm

01:49:57.679 --> 01:49:59.599
deep in my studies right now

01:49:59.599 --> 01:50:01.440
i sit down in my basement just crack

01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:03.840
books dude for like a couple hours a day

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:06.639
i take extensive notes it's very serious

01:50:06.639 --> 01:50:07.760
it's crazy that you

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:09.280
you got a master's degree and then

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:11.599
turned it into the most stoner [ __ ] in

01:50:11.599 --> 01:50:12.960
the world pretty sick

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:14.800
yeah yeah i thought i mean i'm not gonna

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.239
lie i'm not i'm not bragging i talked

01:50:16.239 --> 01:50:17.360
about some reason i talk about smoking

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:17.920
weed on my

01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:20.639
professional website

01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:24.800
my professional website

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:27.920
but yeah the uh dude there's a logo

01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:28.560
therapy

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:30.080
has decided the whole idea is that like

01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:32.080
the people have an inherent drive for

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:32.800
meaning

01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:34.719
so it's like you know people have like

01:50:34.719 --> 01:50:35.840
the pleasure principle like they have

01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:37.280
like your instincts driving you

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:38.560
but you also have this like you know you

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:39.840
can get driven to being like you know

01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:40.800
instinctually

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.560
like the top of everybody or have like

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:44.480
you know quote unquote like nicest car

01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:45.920
ton of money but then people still have

01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:47.119
all that stuff and feel empty and this

01:50:47.119 --> 01:50:48.239
guy's like well why

01:50:48.239 --> 01:50:49.520
like what is it that doesn't add up

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:50.960
about your situation where you could typ

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:52.159
would have the things

01:50:52.159 --> 01:50:53.440
that are supposed to be the things

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.239
associated with like a status drive

01:50:56.239 --> 01:50:58.000
but why does that feel empty and he's

01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.679
this is like one of the big questions

01:50:59.679 --> 01:51:01.440
this is a big it's a big question yeah

01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:03.360
it's it's like i assume actually i don't

01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:07.840
have any educational

01:51:11.119 --> 01:51:12.400
people can go to college for four years

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.080
and literally learn nothing i have a lot

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:15.520
of things like that assume you learn in

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:16.719
college and that was one of them i can't

01:51:16.719 --> 01:51:17.119
believe

01:51:17.119 --> 01:51:20.159
dude no dude not at all behind the back

01:51:20.159 --> 01:51:21.520
shot oh it's a business school dude they

01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:22.320
just like be like

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.480
hey check out what uh japan or mcdonald

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:26.080
sells in japan you know they do like eel

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:28.800
nuggets and you're like yeah

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:32.239
this is [ __ ] i want my money back

01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:35.520
you know coca-cola in japan it's like

01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:36.320
has like

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.159
green bottles like whatever man what the

01:51:38.159 --> 01:51:40.320
[ __ ] that's marketing

01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.400
all right um business school [ __ ]

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:43.760
sucks yeah

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:46.239
so you know i do feel bad about uh you

01:51:46.239 --> 01:51:48.320
know trashing hot topic man well not

01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.760
really cause i don't know any but

01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:51.920
i feel bad if you're out there you're

01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:53.599
doing well

01:51:53.599 --> 01:51:55.040
i don't like the i don't like that idea

01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:56.960
of being like i was like

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:59.119
in my head like thinking like you know

01:51:59.119 --> 01:52:00.400
what what would me

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:03.360
downgrading in terms of like

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:04.400
professional

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:06.320
stuff be you know if that makes sense

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:08.080
yeah it would be weird if i went and

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:09.760
worked at the mall that would be weird

01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:11.920
at 35 i was like you know so it's like

01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:13.199
there is a reason it'd be disturbing

01:52:13.199 --> 01:52:14.560
there's a reality to that but you know

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.320
it's like but

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:19.199
so this is what i was saying so the uh

01:52:19.199 --> 01:52:19.380
the

01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:20.719
[Music]

01:52:20.719 --> 01:52:23.119
so the guy was kind of uh exploring the

01:52:23.119 --> 01:52:24.639
idea of like what like what is it that

01:52:24.639 --> 01:52:25.440
makes things

01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:27.360
add up in a way that people find sad is

01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:28.960
overtly satisfying and that's like the

01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:30.400
idea of meaning like it has to like kind

01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:31.520
of mean something

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:34.639
and uh he talks about like what he calls

01:52:34.639 --> 01:52:36.800
like overarching meaning where it's like

01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.800
there's like you kind of think about it

01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:40.560
like everything that's ever happened

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:41.599
before

01:52:41.599 --> 01:52:42.960
everything that's happening currently

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:44.560
and everything that possibly could

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:45.040
happen

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:46.480
and that's people try to make sense of

01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.840
all of that at once and he's like it's

01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:49.040
impossible the only thing you can do is

01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:49.760
make

01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:52.159
uh your own life mean something

01:52:52.159 --> 01:52:53.440
depending on but you're also not

01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:54.560
interacting in a vacuum you're

01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:55.760
interacting with

01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.360
forces really of all the stuff that's

01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:58.960
ever happened before and the way it's

01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:00.400
affected other people and how they now

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.080
in turn kind of act towards you

01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:04.320
and uh dude i came up with the a cool

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:05.520
visual where it's kind of like the

01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:06.800
atmosphere where like

01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:08.400
you do you're doing actions you're doing

01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:10.000
a bunch of stuff but then things are

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.239
rising up into a sort of kind of like

01:53:12.239 --> 01:53:14.239
karmic weather where like that's when

01:53:14.239 --> 01:53:15.679
you become born you're born into

01:53:15.679 --> 01:53:17.360
circumstances that have kind of happened

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:18.880
before you even did anything so they do

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:20.000
kind of shape you but you have it's

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.360
ultimately up to you

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.639
how what you're going to do with those

01:53:22.639 --> 01:53:24.560
circumstances so it's like there is a

01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:25.679
force against you

01:53:25.679 --> 01:53:27.760
that's why if a guy is like you know oh

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:29.199
i just wanted to be rich blah blah blah

01:53:29.199 --> 01:53:29.840
but like

01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:31.280
gets all that stuff but say like his

01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:33.040
family is kind of poor he might still

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:34.400
feel bad that his family so it's not

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.159
you know i think that i think that that

01:53:36.159 --> 01:53:37.679
is what cripples me

01:53:37.679 --> 01:53:40.800
what that concept of like uh

01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:43.440
i can't i can't go like through any one

01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:45.040
experience without

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.840
trying to insert it into like the

01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:50.080
infinite space of my entire life

01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:52.320
exactly exactly well yeah that's kind of

01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.840
exactly what he's talking about now yeah

01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:56.719
you have to like master master your own

01:53:56.719 --> 01:53:58.320
self or at least like

01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:01.520
kind of come to an acceptance of what

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:02.800
you are

01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:05.679
so that you can use what you are to get

01:54:05.679 --> 01:54:06.560
what you want

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.639
like because so one of the one of the

01:54:08.639 --> 01:54:10.560
things that we we fail to realize is

01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:11.520
that

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:14.000
as humans we're like we're a tool we're

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.280
a tool for the world

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:17.440
that's basically what we are we're a

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:18.400
social tool

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:20.560
so every limit like every um weird

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:22.719
limitation that you see

01:54:22.719 --> 01:54:24.880
is like a skill if you flip it on the

01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:26.480
other side it's like well how do you how

01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:27.920
can you use that

01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:30.080
to your advantage you know yeah that's

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:31.920
what they talk about in uh

01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:33.199
[ __ ] i think it's neuro-linguistic

01:54:33.199 --> 01:54:34.639
programming if you have say like people

01:54:34.639 --> 01:54:36.239
have panic attacks they're like

01:54:36.239 --> 01:54:37.599
okay you have panic attacks but that

01:54:37.599 --> 01:54:39.280
does mean you have extremely you have an

01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:40.639
extremely strong imagination

01:54:40.639 --> 01:54:43.599
and you have um you know extremely vivid

01:54:43.599 --> 01:54:44.560
self-talk

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:46.080
yeah they're like that's [ __ ] that

01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:47.679
rules if you can channel that yeah so

01:54:47.679 --> 01:54:49.360
how do you how do you use that

01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:52.159
to to now achieve your goals and move

01:54:52.159 --> 01:54:53.040
away

01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:56.080
like move that away from

01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:58.239
being idle so that it's giving you panic

01:54:58.239 --> 01:54:59.679
attacks like put that

01:54:59.679 --> 01:55:01.679
put those things to good use yeah yeah

01:55:01.679 --> 01:55:03.520
no that's well that was the uh

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:05.360
because the book is basically about the

01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:06.719
book i'm one of them that i was reading

01:55:06.719 --> 01:55:07.440
was like

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:09.840
people now have like no meaning at all

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.119
they just are like what the [ __ ] am i

01:55:11.119 --> 01:55:12.480
doing with my life this is a waste the

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:13.599
things i'm doing sucks i don't really

01:55:13.599 --> 01:55:14.719
believe in anything

01:55:14.719 --> 01:55:16.560
and that was kind of the idea of like

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:18.080
once you can get into it where like your

01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:20.639
daily actions and decisions become like

01:55:20.639 --> 01:55:22.400
you're like oh [ __ ] i'm making a

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:23.840
decision today and you get real into the

01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:24.960
fact that you're like

01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:26.159
within you're kind of thrown into a

01:55:26.159 --> 01:55:27.520
stream of like chaos and all this stuff

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.040
that's constantly going on but like

01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:30.320
if you look at circles it's like you

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:32.159
know there's like the overarching circle

01:55:32.159 --> 01:55:33.520
that contains almost like everything and

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:34.639
then there's like you know just like

01:55:34.639 --> 01:55:36.719
the world your country society your

01:55:36.719 --> 01:55:37.920
family there's all these forces that are

01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:38.400
but you

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:39.760
always have this little circle around

01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:41.280
you that's like your own free will and

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:42.400
your choices

01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:43.760
like people forget that you know

01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:45.760
whatever but i do like the idea like

01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:47.119
people do all these actions and it just

01:55:47.119 --> 01:55:48.560
kind of evaporates up and then it kind

01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:50.639
of precipitates down in like another

01:55:50.639 --> 01:55:51.599
realm and then you're just like some

01:55:51.599 --> 01:55:52.880
guy's coming up to you like out of

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:54.480
nowhere with like no shirt screaming at

01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:56.400
you and you're like well what the [ __ ]

01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:57.920
that was a whole chain of actions that

01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:59.280
happened over the course of years and

01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:00.639
it's now presenting and then like

01:56:00.639 --> 01:56:01.920
people find their meaning and how they

01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:03.679
interact with that kind of force of

01:56:03.679 --> 01:56:04.719
things that had happened and they're

01:56:04.719 --> 01:56:06.960
happening now yeah and how you're also

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:08.159
pushing that you know

01:56:08.159 --> 01:56:09.360
depending on what you're doing you're

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:11.360
also adding or you know

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:13.119
rectifying stuff like that i mean really

01:56:13.119 --> 01:56:15.119
just that's your real superpower

01:56:15.119 --> 01:56:17.920
is is uh digesting all that and then

01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:20.320
breaking it down in that way

01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:21.520
that's like i think that's where you

01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:22.880
really accept like explaining that kind

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:24.080
of [ __ ]

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.080
dude every time i say stuff i'm like i

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:27.280
[ __ ] i don't think it makes sense that

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:28.000
ruled

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.760
yeah dude i was trying to draw the

01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:31.119
graphic the other day i was trying to

01:56:31.119 --> 01:56:32.560
suck at drawing but i was like i have to

01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:34.000
i have to commute i have to figure out

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.199
this out i feel like that's the kind of

01:56:35.199 --> 01:56:36.239
concept where people have to like

01:56:36.239 --> 01:56:38.000
memorize [ __ ] and then like stand behind

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.040
a podium and say it

01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:42.560
diagram extremely high but yeah

01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:44.000
you know what i mean like there's like

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.440
some guy trying to explain that same

01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.239
concept

01:56:46.239 --> 01:56:48.159
at the same level would be like

01:56:48.159 --> 01:56:49.920
nervously shuffling index cards behind a

01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:52.080
podium

01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:53.840
um which brings us a figure just like

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.360
you just make this to a slide that's not

01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:56.560
responding

01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:01.840
um move the mouse

01:57:03.530 --> 01:57:06.320
[Laughter]

01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:08.239
those guys too they're not like um

01:57:08.239 --> 01:57:09.599
they're just like reading this stuff and

01:57:09.599 --> 01:57:10.960
trying to regurgitate it they're not

01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:12.639
living it they're not applying it

01:57:12.639 --> 01:57:16.239
or actually seeing how they're within

01:57:16.239 --> 01:57:17.199
this as well

01:57:17.199 --> 01:57:18.880
like a lot of times these people like if

01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:20.719
they read this stuff they go oh

01:57:20.719 --> 01:57:22.480
that's how people are and they kind of

01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:24.000
separate themselves

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.800
from it as well so if you can actually

01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:28.000
see where you fall

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.440
that's what you're saying yeah not

01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:30.960
dealing with it just in like theory but

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:31.280
like

01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:32.639
yeah dude i've gotten real into that

01:57:32.639 --> 01:57:34.159
where i started now like when i do

01:57:34.159 --> 01:57:36.560
anything or make decisions being like

01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:38.159
the idea is that every it's not like you

01:57:38.159 --> 01:57:39.679
say like what's the overarching meaning

01:57:39.679 --> 01:57:40.800
of life you're like what's the meaning

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:41.520
of the moment

01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:42.719
and you're constantly fulfilling the

01:57:42.719 --> 01:57:44.000
meaning of the moment by making small

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:44.960
little decisions

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:46.480
that do add up to big things but while

01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:47.440
you're making them they don't really

01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:48.800
feel like anything unless you start to

01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:49.520
like

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:51.679
really get into the fact of like what am

01:57:51.679 --> 01:57:52.960
i going to do when i go home and like

01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:54.080
you know why am i going to do that

01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:55.360
you're not like in like a psychotic way

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:57.840
but you're always trying to

01:57:57.840 --> 01:57:59.040
first of all you're trying to like go

01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:00.800
through like preconceived values but

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:02.159
then they even say in the thing

01:58:02.159 --> 01:58:03.199
you have a lot of times you have

01:58:03.199 --> 01:58:04.960
conflicting values where you're like i

01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:06.400
want to work really hard and want to be

01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:06.880
like you know

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:08.400
professionally successful but also want

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:10.159
to be a good parent

01:58:10.159 --> 01:58:11.280
and then like people get [ __ ] up

01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:12.320
because they overlap because they're

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:13.679
like am i spending too much time

01:58:13.679 --> 01:58:14.960
parenting or should i be working a

01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:15.920
little more

01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:18.000
but the only time your values can

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.520
overlap this is really cool from the

01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:20.239
book

01:58:20.239 --> 01:58:21.920
um is when you're dealing in just the

01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:23.920
two dimensions so like if you deal if

01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:24.159
you

01:58:24.159 --> 01:58:27.040
zoom out into the human spiritual realm

01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:28.320
if you see the two circles that are

01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:29.520
overlapping

01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.199
really they're just like the shadow from

01:58:31.199 --> 01:58:32.960
the third dimension because like a rod

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:35.119
and a cone will just produce circles

01:58:35.119 --> 01:58:36.400
that will overlap but if you go up

01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.920
you'll see that one is on top one

01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:38.960
staggered higher than the other so

01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.000
that's why you have to like

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.280
rank order what you actually think is

01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:42.960
the most important and then just so it's

01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:44.880
like kind of like those slides like one

01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:46.239
like i don't know which colors make

01:58:46.239 --> 01:58:47.840
colors but like you put them together

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:49.119
and they make green and you pull them

01:58:49.119 --> 01:58:50.400
apart and it's like blue and yellow yeah

01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:51.679
it's like if it was a shadow it would

01:58:51.679 --> 01:58:52.960
look like two things would look just

01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:54.480
like overlapping on each other but if

01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:56.159
you looked at their actual thing in 3d

01:58:56.159 --> 01:58:57.679
you'd see that like one was higher than

01:58:57.679 --> 01:58:58.239
the other one

01:58:58.239 --> 01:58:59.440
yeah so that's not really happening so

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:00.880
for me it's like the light the light

01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:02.480
hitting it a certain like at a certain

01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:04.159
angle you see green but if you

01:59:04.159 --> 01:59:06.639
pull it's like the same thing

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:07.760
perspective i'm using color

01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:08.960
they're saying like you can't have you

01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:10.480
can't have clashes of values you just

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.840
have to zoom out and see like just be

01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:13.119
like which one is actually more

01:59:13.119 --> 01:59:13.679
important

01:59:13.679 --> 01:59:14.880
you know that's kind of like once you

01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:16.560
rank order them you're like oh i do

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:18.480
value this one over that one blah blah

01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:19.840
yeah i don't know that that was kind of

01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:21.440
but it was cool when he when i saw like

01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:22.560
three dimensional things they're talking

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:25.360
about shadows i was like oh [ __ ]

01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:26.800
[ __ ] wait was this from school or

01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:28.639
independent research independent

01:59:28.639 --> 01:59:30.159
research dude i didn't like

01:59:30.159 --> 01:59:32.159
[ __ ] in [ __ ] school yeah i was

01:59:32.159 --> 01:59:33.920
picturing you like taking notes like oh

01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:36.159
hell yeah no that's what pisses me off

01:59:36.159 --> 01:59:37.040
about they didn't tell us

01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:39.040
like they would just go into like really

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:40.159
basic

01:59:40.159 --> 01:59:42.560
uh like theory and then be like and he

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:44.239
was a [ __ ] remember that guy who came

01:59:44.239 --> 01:59:46.239
up with all that stuff in like 1912

01:59:46.239 --> 01:59:47.920
he was also a [ __ ] [ __ ] and it's

01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:49.599
like yeah dude no way

01:59:49.599 --> 01:59:52.000
obviously oh dude they're like should we

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.199
even learn freud

01:59:53.199 --> 01:59:56.480
i'm like i don't know he invented

01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:59.440
psychology

01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:00.480
he wrote like 40 books and

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:01.920
revolutionized the way we think about

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:04.239
our minds but yeah okay

02:00:04.239 --> 02:00:07.440
sure sure

02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:10.480
dude are you told on them i used to get

02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:11.119
mad

02:00:11.119 --> 02:00:12.639
in class when people would come at freud

02:00:12.639 --> 02:00:14.560
i'd be like i mean dude i'm not

02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:16.000
by no means a freudian dude but in my

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.159
head i'm like married to a freudian

02:00:18.159 --> 02:00:20.480
huh you're married to a freudian that'd

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:22.000
been funny that guy was driving

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:26.239
i got a free

02:00:26.239 --> 02:00:29.760
but yeah dude um yeah no the uh

02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:31.840
the the karmic atmosphere is [ __ ] i

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:32.880
like that a lot of just

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:34.719
action just coming up and then just

02:00:34.719 --> 02:00:36.239
precipitating down and like things

02:00:36.239 --> 02:00:37.280
you're just like what the [ __ ] did this

02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:38.159
happen

02:00:38.159 --> 02:00:41.440
so that's my when i make decisions now

02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:42.159
dude i just i

02:00:42.159 --> 02:00:43.360
like we'll stop thinking about it

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:44.960
imagine like my little new agenda they

02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:46.159
call it new agent

02:00:46.159 --> 02:00:47.760
it's like you're like the specifically

02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:49.520
human realm that like is your free

02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:51.119
choice no matter what's going on

02:00:51.119 --> 02:00:52.400
i just imagine that thing spinning

02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:53.760
around me whenever i make a decision

02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:54.960
dude it's pretty tight

02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:57.360
damn it's pretty cool yeah getting deep

02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:58.719
great this is me finding out there's a

02:00:58.719 --> 02:01:02.239
spirit inside my body and it killed me

02:01:02.719 --> 02:01:05.840
wait a minute yeah it is pretty weird

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:07.199
dude walk around like i just do it

02:01:07.199 --> 02:01:08.880
forever just be like

02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:10.000
like i think what you're describing

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.440
maybe two said when you're like sitting

02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.320
at the uh

02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:13.920
you're doing two jobs you get kicked out

02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:15.360
of uh school and you're just like you

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:15.679
just

02:01:15.679 --> 02:01:16.960
hate your life like what the [ __ ] is the

02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:18.800
point of this yes i said it's a sucky

02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:19.760
feeling

02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:23.119
it is still to this day

02:01:23.119 --> 02:01:25.440
was the worst time of my life yeah dude

02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:28.000
i've spent like

02:01:28.159 --> 02:01:32.000
i would say a solid four or five year

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.920
four years like that of being like i

02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:35.760
legitimately hate my life yeah it was

02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:37.040
like for me was like two or three my

02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.639
adult part of my adult life i remember

02:01:38.639 --> 02:01:40.159
being like i legitimately hate my

02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:41.199
[ __ ] life yeah

02:01:41.199 --> 02:01:42.960
that's dude that's the worst in every

02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:44.960
situation i put myself in i

02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:46.320
[ __ ] it's not worth it dude there's

02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:47.840
people who just like casually hate their

02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:49.679
life and i'm like

02:01:49.679 --> 02:01:51.360
yeah dude but that's the thing you see

02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:52.880
so many people casually hating their

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:54.000
life it's like okay

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.320
well i guess i can like casually hate my

02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:58.880
life better than them

02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:01.040
you know so i'll just do that i guess

02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:02.400
yeah you know or just commiserate i

02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:03.679
think people get in like commiserating

02:02:03.679 --> 02:02:04.239
real hard

02:02:04.239 --> 02:02:06.159
yeah but you don't you don't you don't

02:02:06.159 --> 02:02:08.400
get taught that you can

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:10.880
you can structure your life in a way

02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:12.000
that

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.320
works for you and makes you happy you

02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:15.199
don't at all

02:02:15.199 --> 02:02:17.119
never no now you don't get taught to

02:02:17.119 --> 02:02:18.800
manage time either

02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:20.880
no which is crazy if you think about it

02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:22.239
there's no that's your most valuable

02:02:22.239 --> 02:02:22.560
that's

02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:24.639
the most like valuable asset you have

02:02:24.639 --> 02:02:26.639
yeah not to be you know

02:02:26.639 --> 02:02:28.159
like hot chicken someone say at the

02:02:28.159 --> 02:02:30.000
fundamental level it's the only answer

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.199
exactly that's what i'm saying it's a

02:02:31.199 --> 02:02:32.800
big [ __ ] deal how you smell like dude

02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:34.080
it's a bigger deal about you know

02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:34.800
because you're like you know

02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:36.639
you check on your money stuff you you

02:02:36.639 --> 02:02:37.920
know you check on you make sure you

02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:39.599
don't get like too fat with the food

02:02:39.599 --> 02:02:41.599
but you can just burn time dude like 20

02:02:41.599 --> 02:02:42.880
years goes by and you're like

02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:45.040
[ __ ] yeah i think that's the labor put

02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:46.639
themselves people put themselves through

02:02:46.639 --> 02:02:47.119
now

02:02:47.119 --> 02:02:48.880
it's like they're it's like the empty

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:50.480
calorie [ __ ] in their life talked about

02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:52.000
this somewhere before but like

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.360
people are just filling up their time

02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:55.360
with these like uh like projected

02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:56.560
feelings from the internet

02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:58.159
and they're counting that as like the

02:02:58.159 --> 02:03:00.000
labor of growing and living your

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.040
life yeah and she's like no you're just

02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:05.520

02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:06.960
any better for it like i said empty

people of color cool enough in a movie

02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:24.800
like people who spend their time

02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:26.080
right that's what i'm talking about so

02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:27.280
there there's this thing where like

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:28.320
people want

02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:30.239
the consequence of a life experience

02:03:30.239 --> 02:03:31.760
without actually living that life

02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:32.639
experience

02:03:32.639 --> 02:03:34.880
so like so like for me i grew up i grew

02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:36.880
up in a very bad neighborhood

02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:39.840
and it kind of made me uh like say like

02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.119
self-aware and tough

02:03:41.119 --> 02:03:42.800
right so it's like they want to be like

02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:44.400
cool and my wiener really big

02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:50.560
yeah i'm 40 and i can dunk it's no big

02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:56.239
deal

02:03:56.239 --> 02:04:00.320
you know maybe self-aware trouble

02:04:01.679 --> 02:04:03.520
in some ways my uh upbringing really

02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:05.280
influenced how good i eat [ __ ]

02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:07.199
uh that's not what i came here to talk

02:04:07.199 --> 02:04:09.199
about yeah dude i can't help that

02:04:09.199 --> 02:04:12.000
i can't help you you you made you aware

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:12.320
but

02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:14.639
let let's just say that i mean we're

02:04:14.639 --> 02:04:15.440
we'll go with that

02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:18.000
or whatever whatever it is whatever edge

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.520
that like it seems like

02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:21.920
i have that is at all envious at all

02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:23.040
right now i know what you mean

02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:24.320
if you went to like martha's vineyard

02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:25.920
there'd be like or really i was driving

02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:27.599
past the restaurant uh

02:04:27.599 --> 02:04:29.119
right on written house today and there's

02:04:29.119 --> 02:04:30.320
people who sit out there that i'm like

02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:32.239
damn these guys are like

02:04:32.239 --> 02:04:33.840
super faint like fancy to where you can

02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:35.760
see it from like the way they move their

02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:37.280
body you're like whoa

02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:38.480
i don't think anyone ever pushed that

02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:40.320
person yeah and dude never and they

02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:41.199
don't start

02:04:41.199 --> 02:04:43.360
at that point right they don't start at

02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:44.719
fancy they develop

02:04:44.719 --> 02:04:46.719
that yeah they develop over time and

02:04:46.719 --> 02:04:48.239
they have to develop

02:04:48.239 --> 02:04:50.639
their uh existence or their personality

02:04:50.639 --> 02:04:52.639
through all their shortcomings and that

02:04:52.639 --> 02:04:54.239
they deal with in life so

02:04:54.239 --> 02:04:56.880
it's not that you get to just be

02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:57.840
something

02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:00.719
right yeah so these people now think

02:05:00.719 --> 02:05:01.360
that they

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:03.520
they can just declare something that

02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:04.719
they identify with

02:05:04.719 --> 02:05:07.840
and now they are just that

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:11.119
right so it's like they get but with no

02:05:11.119 --> 02:05:12.320
life experience

02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:15.199
they they it's like remember when we

02:05:15.199 --> 02:05:16.079
were young

02:05:16.079 --> 02:05:17.840
and we were trying to convince the

02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:19.119
adults that we didn't need life

02:05:19.119 --> 02:05:20.400
experience we know what we're talking

02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:21.520
about yeah

02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:23.599
now we're in this world where like

02:05:23.599 --> 02:05:25.360
they're like yeah you guys are right

02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:26.639
you don't need life experience you do

02:05:26.639 --> 02:05:28.400
know what you're talking about

02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:31.599
and i think it's it's killing common

02:05:31.599 --> 02:05:32.400
sense

02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:34.400
and just general interaction between

02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:36.000
humans i know you're saying yeah

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.360
that was like again that was in school

02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:38.880
when like somebody who just got out of

02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:39.840
college

02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:42.159
would be like i think freud's it's like

02:05:42.159 --> 02:05:43.199
well there's people who've

02:05:43.199 --> 02:05:45.199
read all of his books for like 12 years

02:05:45.199 --> 02:05:46.320
so you know

02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:47.440
yeah you're basing this little i know

02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:48.400
what you're saying you're basing this

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:50.560
off of nothing and everyone's like yeah

02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:53.199
i agree with you and it's like yeah yeah

02:05:53.199 --> 02:05:54.400
kind of sucks

02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:55.840
i'm trying to think of stuff people do

02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:57.520
like internet activities brought into

02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:58.560
real life

02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.239
i know there is like uh i wish you could

02:06:00.239 --> 02:06:01.760
sock people for talking [ __ ] on freud

02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:04.239
like it was one of your boys

02:06:04.239 --> 02:06:06.079
you're talking spicy right now dude i

02:06:06.079 --> 02:06:07.760
mean i have bones to pick with something

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:09.520
but you have to you have to admire man

02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:10.880
oh dude you've you come you guys dude

02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:11.599
the guy

02:06:11.599 --> 02:06:14.719
did so much coke that he was just like i

02:06:14.719 --> 02:06:17.520
think there's another part of our mind

02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:20.800
we don't know about that he was the

02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:21.920
original stoner dad

02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:26.079
100 dude he's the coke dad

02:06:26.079 --> 02:06:27.679
he would just do coke and his family

02:06:27.679 --> 02:06:29.040
couldn't come into his office where he

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:30.560
was writing he's like dude i am

02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:32.719
on like i'm going to it would have been

02:06:32.719 --> 02:06:34.560
like he was jacked into the matrix right

02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:34.960
now

02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:36.800
he was like i mean i'm like discovering

02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.320
aliens basically he's like i have an

02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:39.840
alien in my desk that's how much he was

02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:40.320
just like

02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:42.639
i'm changing humanity's entire outlook

02:06:42.639 --> 02:06:44.079
whoa was aware of it

02:06:44.079 --> 02:06:46.079
yeah he was pretty i kind of imagined

02:06:46.079 --> 02:06:47.360
him being like kind of humble about it

02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:48.480
like yeah this is what i think is going

02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:48.800
on

02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:51.280
no he was uh from what i you know but i

02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:52.079
it was pretty

02:06:52.079 --> 02:06:54.400
like yeah dude this is going to be yeah

02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:55.440
this is going to be it he's like this is

02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:56.000
going to change

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.360
everyone's going to become aware of this

02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:58.480
other part of their brain that they

02:06:58.480 --> 02:06:59.760
don't know about that's constantly

02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.280
feeding them like thoughts and informing

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:02.480
their actions in ways that they're not

02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:03.920
like conscious it drove him insane by

02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:05.040
the end he was trying to get struck by

02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:06.320
lightning the time travel he was like

02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:07.520
i'm going to prove something again here

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:09.199
we go i don't know what the [ __ ] he did

02:07:09.199 --> 02:07:11.199
he was coke he was on coke and true yeah

02:07:11.199 --> 02:07:12.960
did he have his best years on coke

02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:14.400
yeah dude he had the other nice

02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:15.840
background job more like your own coke

02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:17.040
nice dude yeah

02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:18.400
it's like yeah yeah i like five hour

02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:20.639
energy

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.760
but yeah that is it's funny too now

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:25.280
people can like

02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:27.840
fully rage out on a completely

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.679
inconsequential medium of the internet

02:07:29.679 --> 02:07:31.040
and have people be like you know i mean

02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:32.560
i guess like when things go viral

02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:34.079
people do change a little bit but it's

02:07:34.079 --> 02:07:35.920
like

02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:36.800
i don't know i don't think it really

02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:39.040
does anything i mean net neutrality yeah

02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:40.400
you want to take that away whatever that

02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:40.960
was

02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:43.679
people were like god damn it online it's

02:07:43.679 --> 02:07:44.079
like

02:07:44.079 --> 02:07:45.280
do you remember when like a network

02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:46.800
would have like a good lineup of shows

02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:48.320
when you're a kid and like did families

02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:50.239
lock down for the entire night yeah now

02:07:50.239 --> 02:07:51.440
you can have that every night of the

02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:52.560
week just with

02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:55.040
an algorithm catered to making you mad

02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:55.840
you know what i mean

02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:56.719
there would be like there'd be like

02:07:56.719 --> 02:07:58.000
entire there'd be like three and a half

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.520
years where there wasn't a solid night

02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:01.040
of television on tv you're like

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:02.719
i watch a show here and there but like

02:08:02.719 --> 02:08:04.320
dude a solid thursday night you'd be

02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:07.040
locked down from 6 p.m to 10 p.m tgif

02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:09.199
yeah tgif was pretty reliable yeah dude

02:08:09.199 --> 02:08:10.800
that was that was the king obviously of

02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:11.440
lineups

02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:12.960
i mean dude if you put me down and watch

02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:15.520
like it was a full house urkel

02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:18.079
uh there's like five the other kind of

02:08:18.079 --> 02:08:19.119
rotated didn't they

02:08:19.119 --> 02:08:20.480
yeah i think they switched around but

02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:22.960
what was the one

02:08:25.679 --> 02:08:27.840
step by step step by step was that ever

02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:30.239
a tgif show that was a late teach i

02:08:30.239 --> 02:08:30.960
asked oh yeah

02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:32.159
i don't know it might have been that was

02:08:32.159 --> 02:08:34.000
a little racist classic step by step

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.360
i think it got moved to a different slot

02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:37.040
eventually

02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:38.639
but it kind of broke around but yeah

02:08:38.639 --> 02:08:40.079
that was dude that was foundational for

02:08:40.079 --> 02:08:40.880
sure

02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:42.480
yeah no you're right there it is funny

02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:44.000
to think like you know rather than tv

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.280
there's just like

02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:46.880
little micro shows that float through

02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:48.159
you can watch your own feelings

02:08:48.159 --> 02:08:50.000
specifically designed to like irritate

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.320
you it went from like that one from just

02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:54.400
like didn't i do that and now there's

02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:55.599
like

02:08:55.599 --> 02:08:59.360
i'm racist i should kill myself

02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:04.239
dude dude urkel's on the timeline of

02:09:04.239 --> 02:09:06.400
people coming to that conclusion

02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:08.880
for sure but i do think that's my that's

02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:10.079
my theory right now where a lot of the

02:09:10.079 --> 02:09:10.960
unrest comes from

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:13.920
people like so you have like you have

02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:15.199
rich white people

02:09:15.199 --> 02:09:16.400
who they read about like the white

02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:18.239
privilege stuff and they go like

02:09:18.239 --> 02:09:20.079
yeah my grandmom has been giving me like

02:09:20.079 --> 02:09:21.760
500 bucks a month

02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:23.360
every day every you know since i've been

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:25.920
little i guess i've had it pretty easy

02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:26.880
like all right white people here's the

02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:28.000
new deal then you have like white people

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.199
who like

02:09:29.199 --> 02:09:30.560
uh like worked in coal mines they're

02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:32.800
like no i disagree and i shut the [ __ ]

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:33.360
up yeah

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.199
no your [ __ ] life's as easy as mine

02:09:35.199 --> 02:09:37.040
and here's why but i think now there's

02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:38.159
people who are like because the internet

02:09:38.159 --> 02:09:40.159
all the exposure all the information

02:09:40.159 --> 02:09:41.840
are like because you just if you just

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:43.280
grew up in like a kentucky coal mining

02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:44.000
family

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.119
people probably just chucking around the

02:09:45.119 --> 02:09:46.639
n-word you're like where's my uncle

02:09:46.639 --> 02:09:48.079
that's how we talk and then it was all

02:09:48.079 --> 02:09:49.360
of a sudden it was like no you're

02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:49.679
actually

02:09:49.679 --> 02:09:50.880
really bad and you're like yeah they

02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:52.800
didn't even do the check yeah exactly

02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:54.639
no it was no it was you know i've been

02:09:54.639 --> 02:09:56.159
around places where it's just kind of

02:09:56.159 --> 02:09:56.719
like

02:09:56.719 --> 02:09:59.840
not even a you know yeah well so uh i

02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:01.440
think you'll realize like oh [ __ ] no

02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:02.239
yeah

02:10:02.239 --> 02:10:04.159
i shouldn't do that but then they look

02:10:04.159 --> 02:10:05.520
for a viable alternative it's just a

02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:06.560
bunch of people like

02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:08.239
[ __ ] you you they're like well i don't

02:10:08.239 --> 02:10:09.360
want to do that either so there's a lot

02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:10.960
of people in like a weird limbo in terms

02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:12.239
of like how they uh

02:10:12.239 --> 02:10:13.440
i'm not gonna make the leap because i

02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:14.639
don't like the other side there we go

02:10:14.639 --> 02:10:16.000
exactly they're like well yeah i guess

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.040
they have some points but

02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:18.960
[ __ ] i hate those guys so [ __ ] much

02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:21.040
you're like actually

02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:22.880
there's people who are like i think

02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:24.320
stuck in like a nether realm right now

02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:25.760
they know about those guys and they hate

02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:26.800
them too

02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:29.840
yeah who like the people that would

02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:30.960
bother you about

02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:32.960
opinions they know about the people who

02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:34.159
just don't like them and that's why they

02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:35.520
won't change they know that they don't

02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:37.119
really hold those values

02:10:37.119 --> 02:10:39.360
but they the idea of changing into like

02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:40.239
what the good

02:10:40.239 --> 02:10:42.320
good people are is so unappealing that

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:43.599
they're not that they're not going to go

02:10:43.599 --> 02:10:44.159
through the

02:10:44.159 --> 02:10:46.079
personal change yeah yeah it's also kind

02:10:46.079 --> 02:10:47.280
of crazy that every

02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:49.280
everybody's represented by the

02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:50.719
minorities in

02:10:50.719 --> 02:10:52.079
in the situation like even in that

02:10:52.079 --> 02:10:53.599
situation you just described where the

02:10:53.599 --> 02:10:55.280
one kid was getting 500

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:57.199
a month from his grandmom his whole

02:10:57.199 --> 02:10:58.960
entire life and then the other kid comes

02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:00.639
from like a working family

02:11:00.639 --> 02:11:02.400
like most people come from working

02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:04.239
families yeah but the representation of

02:11:04.239 --> 02:11:04.960
white people

02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:07.119
are these like over privileged white

02:11:07.119 --> 02:11:08.800
people that go out and start these

02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:10.639
[ __ ] poc protests while

02:11:10.639 --> 02:11:12.079
not protest protesting but you know what

02:11:12.079 --> 02:11:14.000
i mean it's like and then the other sign

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.520
wrong like oh [ __ ] yeah

02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:17.679
it's just a joke and then but then it's

02:11:17.679 --> 02:11:18.719
the other way around

02:11:18.719 --> 02:11:20.719
for for black people it's the exact

02:11:20.719 --> 02:11:22.560
opposite where

02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:25.840
uh we're we're represented and

02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:28.480
so for one a lot of people don't know

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:29.360
that

02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:31.280
having the idea of what it means to be

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:32.560
black be represented by

02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:35.440
like like hood culture a lot of people

02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:36.079
don't know that

02:11:36.079 --> 02:11:39.119
that was a white intervention

02:11:39.119 --> 02:11:42.159
in our in society it was like pro

02:11:42.159 --> 02:11:43.280
wrestling invented that

02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:46.159
i think yeah that was the thing it was

02:11:46.159 --> 02:11:46.719
like

02:11:46.719 --> 02:11:48.480
the great the great migration that's

02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:50.000
that's that's when it happened

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.239
and it was like all these southern like

02:11:52.239 --> 02:11:54.239
because again there were like these

02:11:54.239 --> 02:11:56.639
uh up north like stuffy black dudes that

02:11:56.639 --> 02:11:57.840
were like all about hard work and

02:11:57.840 --> 02:11:58.480
reading

02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:00.639
and then all these southerners yeah yeah

02:12:00.639 --> 02:12:01.920
these southern

02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:03.199
black dudes came up here and white

02:12:03.199 --> 02:12:04.560
people were like well these guys are way

02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:05.679
more entertaining

02:12:05.679 --> 02:12:08.560
yeah this is like this is black this is

02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:09.520
this is what i'm doing

02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:12.320
we couldn't we heard about you know so

02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:13.840
it was like that

02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:15.760
that became what was all written about

02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:17.679
so it went from like langston hughes

02:12:17.679 --> 02:12:20.960
to you know like dudes doing the [ __ ]

02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:22.639
shuffle or whatever yeah you know it's

02:12:22.639 --> 02:12:25.119
like it's like that is a crazy

02:12:25.119 --> 02:12:27.840
it's a crazy thing yeah it's gotta suck

02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:29.520
to lose like no we got this look

02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:32.480
yeah that'll pass that'll be and then so

02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:32.960
then the

02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:34.880
the here's here's the funny so then then

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.719
white people get grandfathered into like

02:12:36.719 --> 02:12:37.520
racism

02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:40.320
the same exact way where it's like you

02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:41.679
know these people these other people

02:12:41.679 --> 02:12:43.199
come up and they're doing the dances

02:12:43.199 --> 02:12:44.639
and like you know showing off for all

02:12:44.639 --> 02:12:46.880
these like high society people

02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:49.119
right

02:12:51.679 --> 02:12:53.280
impressed all of the rich white people

02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:55.920
but then you know that behavior

02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:57.679
that was happening with the black people

02:12:57.679 --> 02:12:59.679
black face like the rest of white

02:12:59.679 --> 02:13:01.520
society gets lumped in with that

02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:02.960
it's like remember how remember how we

02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:04.639
used to just like let black people dance

02:13:04.639 --> 02:13:05.760
for us and we just enjoyed that

02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:07.520
whoa whoa whoa whoa we weren't all doing

02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:08.800
that yeah yeah i know

02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:10.480
it was like you guys were doing that

02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:12.320
yeah you know but like all the white

02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:12.880
people

02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:13.920
are lumped into that you're talking

02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:16.800
about reverse racism

02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:18.480
well you'll get guys who will be like

02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:19.760
well you don't even think it's reverse

02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:22.800
racism you just think it's racism

02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:24.480
i i think reverse racism is actually

02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:26.639
closer uh but i gotta think i'm i'm like

02:13:26.639 --> 02:13:27.520
coming down all the time i know what

02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:29.119
you're saying there's like a dude uh

02:13:29.119 --> 02:13:29.760
reverse

02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:31.679
they they treat tony the distinction

02:13:31.679 --> 02:13:33.599
should be if you had slaves

02:13:33.599 --> 02:13:35.360
that should be the maximum penalty where

02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:36.400
it's like because there's people who'll

02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:37.920
be like look man

02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:39.360
we did some horrible it's like you your

02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:41.040
family has slaves dude [ __ ] you

02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:42.639
yeah like if you're if you were like

02:13:42.639 --> 02:13:44.079
super rich now

02:13:44.079 --> 02:13:45.599
currently you come from like an old

02:13:45.599 --> 02:13:47.199
generationally wealthy family

02:13:47.199 --> 02:13:49.679
there's a huge chance you had them bro

02:13:49.679 --> 02:13:50.960
so it's like

02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:55.280
you know that's pretty nuts

02:13:58.239 --> 02:14:00.159
what if what if your your family had

02:14:00.159 --> 02:14:01.760
them and you don't like

02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:03.599
that they had them that's what i think

02:14:03.599 --> 02:14:05.280
they do but they actually they're trying

02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:06.320
to lump you they're like you're just

02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:08.000
like me dude we had them we're white

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.440
we i didn't have them that's the thing i

02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:11.199
said you had them dude yeah which again

02:14:11.199 --> 02:14:12.400
it's like you know maybe we can be

02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:13.920
brothers on some realms but we didn't

02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:14.560
both have them

02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:16.320
oh are they just like they would they

02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:18.000
don't want to do what it takes to

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.760
like differentiate themselves otherwise

02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:21.520
they don't have to they don't yeah

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:22.880
they didn't do it there's a there's a

02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:24.719
heart although i guess they do like any

02:14:24.719 --> 02:14:25.440
any bonus

02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:28.719
any like uh i don't want to say the p

02:14:28.719 --> 02:14:30.159
word i'm not saying the free word here

02:14:30.159 --> 02:14:33.679
what any any like advance advantages

02:14:33.679 --> 02:14:35.040
they had growing up in life oh

02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:36.960
you do have to contribute some of it to

02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:39.280
you know having human puppies

02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:41.679
sure of course i mean dude imagine if it

02:14:41.679 --> 02:14:42.719
was just like

02:14:42.719 --> 02:14:44.880
a bunch of people threw all your [ __ ]

02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:46.320
and you're just like sweet

02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:48.159
yeah you changed my mind dude i now i

02:14:48.159 --> 02:14:49.599
don't like racism

02:14:49.599 --> 02:14:51.360
you used to love it i wouldn't say i

02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:53.280
loved it but now definitely i will say i

02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:55.119
don't like it

02:14:55.119 --> 02:14:56.480
i think it's fun it's just it's low

02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:59.040
density dude i think it's low density

02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:00.719
i see the fun in it how people are like

02:15:00.719 --> 02:15:02.560
this is awesome i just think it's it's

02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:03.199
low density

02:15:03.199 --> 02:15:05.040
there's like [ __ ] around because it's

02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:05.920
like when you work on a construction

02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:07.360
site a lot of times there is [ __ ]

02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:07.679
around

02:15:07.679 --> 02:15:09.520
what you're saying is after after like a

02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:11.679
certain point slavery is just not funny

02:15:11.679 --> 02:15:12.320
anymore

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:15.679
exactly yeah it was it got old the gag

02:15:15.679 --> 02:15:17.440
was up

02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:19.199
they played it out slavery got played

02:15:19.199 --> 02:15:21.040
out the gag was up for sure

02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:24.079
wow you're like all right enough we

02:15:24.079 --> 02:15:26.400
get it

02:15:27.599 --> 02:15:30.079
but no it uh yeah if we're gonna all

02:15:30.079 --> 02:15:30.800
stand dude

02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:32.079
it is one of the things we have to

02:15:32.079 --> 02:15:33.440
completely just yeah we're done with

02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:35.599
this this is [ __ ] so stupid

02:15:35.599 --> 02:15:37.360
this is so stupid yeah welcome to the

02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:39.760
stoner dead welcome to stone or dads

02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:41.360
it was it was the one percent only the

02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:43.119
one percent had slaves

02:15:43.119 --> 02:15:44.880
yeah i think so only the one person had

02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:47.760
all of the slaves

02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:50.960
one percent of the population oh my god

02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:52.000
do you think that people have arguments

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:53.119
about slave distribution they're like

02:15:53.119 --> 02:15:55.440
dude

02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:59.199
you hogging up all the human puppies dog

02:16:00.159 --> 02:16:01.520
it is crazy it's like you got a human

02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:03.040
puppy mill over there what is going on

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:04.159
where you getting all these human

02:16:04.159 --> 02:16:05.280
puppies

02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:08.239
well sure i'll bid on one but i thought

02:16:08.239 --> 02:16:10.639
we i thought we got him neutered

02:16:10.639 --> 02:16:12.480
it is funny how that slowly spun out of

02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:13.679
control

02:16:13.679 --> 02:16:14.880
how it was like well i think was it

02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:17.040
slavery got abolished before it got like

02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:18.639
abolished abolished in the united states

02:16:18.639 --> 02:16:20.400
it got abolished earlier on in history

02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:22.560
i think a couple times right different

02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:23.840
societies were like yeah we could you

02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:24.560
know we can't

02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:26.400
yeah and then like things would kind of

02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:29.280
slide down again and they'd be like

02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:31.840
this time guys definitely here no i'm

02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:32.319
telling you

02:16:32.319 --> 02:16:33.439
they've like there's been a couple of

02:16:33.439 --> 02:16:34.800
civilizations like yeah no this is

02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:35.840
[ __ ] we're not doing this and then it

02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:37.280
would like reset or another country

02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:37.920
would be like

02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:40.160
we're doing it they're [ __ ] doing it

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:40.960
what the [ __ ]

02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:42.559
yeah we don't want to get behind yeah

02:16:42.559 --> 02:16:44.399
like oh [ __ ]

02:16:44.399 --> 02:16:46.080
yeah we're just old school sorry we know

02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:47.519
you guys aren't raising uh

02:16:47.519 --> 02:16:49.519
slavery we're just you know we do things

02:16:49.519 --> 02:16:50.880
yeah it apparently got banished a couple

02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:52.160
times throughout like uh just please

02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:53.439
getting parts of the world and they were

02:16:53.439 --> 02:16:54.639
just kind of like

02:16:54.639 --> 02:16:56.719
you know what would be cool yeah well i

02:16:56.719 --> 02:16:58.240
mean that's that's i mean

02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:00.000
i would imagine historically i don't i

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:01.120
don't know all these cases you're

02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:02.240
talking about but i would imagine has

02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:03.519
something to do with like

02:17:03.519 --> 02:17:05.920
hey we had slaves we're crushing it now

02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:06.639
let's

02:17:06.639 --> 02:17:09.280
let's stop slavery that's like those are

02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:10.880
the people that are trying to come up

02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:13.120
yeah let's end their main source of

02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:14.160
everything well they i think they

02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:14.719
wouldn't

02:17:14.719 --> 02:17:15.760
end it but they would just set up like

02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:17.439
rigid cast systems where they were like

02:17:17.439 --> 02:17:18.719
all right nobody's a slave but

02:17:18.719 --> 02:17:21.280
you [ __ ] suck and you always suck and

02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:22.800
you kind of have to do what i want but

02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:24.000
you can live for everyone it doesn't

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:24.639
matter

02:17:24.639 --> 02:17:25.920
that's what that's how india handled it

02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:27.679
forever they just had like you were just

02:17:27.679 --> 02:17:29.200
born into a cast where like if you even

02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:30.639
i think if you got caught

02:17:30.639 --> 02:17:33.040
trying to learn about uh like there was

02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:34.399
like the brahmana was like the top dude

02:17:34.399 --> 02:17:35.280
and then there was like a

02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.200
warrior took bathrooms all the way down

02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:38.319
yeah all the way down and if you were

02:17:38.319 --> 02:17:40.000
trying to read the religious text

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
they would like burn your eyes out like

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:43.599
dude you're a [ __ ] peasant

02:17:43.599 --> 02:17:46.719
your brain can't handle this [ __ ] so

02:17:46.719 --> 02:17:47.760
i think you were just that would just be

02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:50.719
your peasants wouldn't a greater

02:17:50.719 --> 02:17:51.840
punishment let them

02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:53.519
like read the text and have their brain

02:17:53.519 --> 02:17:55.280
melt you know rather than like burn

02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:57.439
their eyes that's the punishment

02:17:57.439 --> 02:17:58.880
make a distinction between your soul and

02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:02.800
your body yeah you'll lose your mind

02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:06.240
but yeah man [ __ ] rules

02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:08.080
they were just trying to stop like the

02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:11.120
prophecy of aladdin

02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:13.679
like that one peasant that rose above

02:18:13.679 --> 02:18:15.519
and ruled them all

02:18:15.519 --> 02:18:16.800
and apparently they say that's where

02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:18.319
that's where the uh that's why they

02:18:18.319 --> 02:18:20.399
outlawed like charismatic monkeys

02:18:20.399 --> 02:18:21.920
you could never move because they were

02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:24.080
like

02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:27.519
apparently all the most successful

02:18:27.519 --> 02:18:29.280
chinese dynasties were peasant

02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:33.439
revolutions yeah han dynasty

02:18:33.439 --> 02:18:35.760
peasant revolutions pretty tight dude

02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:36.559
they're learning

02:18:36.559 --> 02:18:39.040
to use their farming tools as weapons

02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:40.000
that's probably awesome

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.599
well the first dude to just spin a rake

02:18:41.599 --> 02:18:43.359
around like because he was bored

02:18:43.359 --> 02:18:45.040
someone had to invent spinning rakes

02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:47.200
around like they were ninja toys

02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:48.719
i mean dude you would just go you would

02:18:48.719 --> 02:18:50.880
just be like getting taxed hard as [ __ ]

02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:52.880
all the time and then one day

02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:54.800
this sucks and like you talked about it

02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:56.000
you're nine-year-old and he's in the

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:56.800
field just like

02:18:56.800 --> 02:18:58.319
yeah you were just the guy hey where's

02:18:58.319 --> 02:18:59.519
that rice and you got four people

02:18:59.519 --> 02:19:00.080
waiting

02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:01.760
kill him you kill the other lord then

02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:03.200
you go to the castle like yeah you guys

02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:03.840
are dead

02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:07.040
they think oh [ __ ] god damn it

02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:08.399
we're in charge what do you want to do

02:19:08.399 --> 02:19:09.920
and they just do the same exact thing

02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:11.120
we're not allowed to own weapons

02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:12.719
like people should give us stuff

02:19:12.719 --> 02:19:14.399
actually yeah

02:19:14.399 --> 02:19:16.800
wow but that's not what i came here to

02:20:04.399 --> 02:20:05.840
that's that's something someone very

02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:07.520

order like the preferred cut

02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:43.040
