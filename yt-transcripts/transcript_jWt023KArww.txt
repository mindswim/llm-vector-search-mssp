yeah what do you think of journalists

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.840
collectively they're an important check

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.159
on power oh my god oh

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.319
yeah you should get punched in the belly

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.400
for that it's a reasonable comment it's

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.000
a reasonable comment to say about

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.280
tucker uh tucker i don't watch enough

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.000
tucker dude

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
i did see the john oliver thing on him

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.519
pretty brutal it was really

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.599
unwatchable yeah john oliver's pretty

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.120
gay it's like

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.480
it almost made me do the opposite of the

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.720
thing that john oller was trying to do

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.760
you try to hate him

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.040
yeah yeah because it's just like

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.720
i mean you already covered it but it it

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.479
basically is like

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.359
um tucker carlson you wah blah blah blah

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.639
there's the joke

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.080
and then do moldy piece of wonder bread

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.000
tucker it's like every single time yeah

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.560
yeah whoever writes for him bro

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.120
like must have watched rose battles four

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.639
years ago

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.360
that's how you start a sentence yeah you

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.560
know what i mean before you tell your

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.080
joke you're like

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.759
you say something yeah like you

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.280
pedophile

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.080
yeah yeah and it's all one note it's

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.560
just like

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.520
ah yeah there's worse is the one joke he

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.880
only does which is like

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.080
no sharon you can't take that it's this

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.520
you cannot do that okay now

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.759
like i mean that's it every single time

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.680
anyway yeah man he had that one and i

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.400
don't remember

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.280
exactly what he said on that but because

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.880
the move that he was accusing tucker

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.240
making which i guess tucker does make is

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.360
there's like what does that mean what

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.360
does white supremacy even mean

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.600
and so then john allison defines it yeah

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.120
that's a tough one

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.199
but then we talked about we're the best

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.240
oh i'm sorry yeah i watched him recently

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.520
talk about the vaccine and how

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.880
vaccinated people still have to wear the

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.720
mask i had to turn it off

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.320

me dude he was fine they're being like

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.800
yeah why do we have

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.680
oh oliver no no no tucker was watching

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.800
and talking about a thing he was like

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.240
and if the vaccines work

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.960

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.160

i'm getting the raw deal they're [ __ ]

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.560
bullying ted cruz about not wearing a

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.560
mask he's been vaccinated he's a hoax

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.960
though

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.280
was it it might have been rubio he's a

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.400
hoax yeah it's true

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.919
no now they're cool now they're cool

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.000
anybody that trump murdered embodied

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.600
yeah that's true gone dude i don't want

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.120
to hear you how is there not another

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.960
person who can come out and just

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.360
like trump again like the one guy tried

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.479
it there was that one senator from

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.759
florida who was like i'll step on your

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.120
[ __ ] head with golf cleats and

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.840
everything's like

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.680
yeah that's not how he did it that's not

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.840
how he did it it was more funny

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.520

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:39.600
that though because then

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.160
oliver comes off of that comment when

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.800
then he defines white supremacy

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.880
in a way that if i remember right i only

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.800

and then there's a

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.320
app that just disconnects whenever a

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.079

advisor or whatever to try to

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.800
change your reservation so it's like

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.160
automated at first and then it's like

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.360
one moment we'll connect you with

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:47.920

immediately i realized this today

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.279
whenever i encounter some sort of

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:36.639
conflict where it's like

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:39.120
like today i was like i was like i saw a

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.120
matter

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.800
the funny part was then more importantly

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.720

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.920

instantly i always catch it just

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.800
instantly blaming as many people as

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.680
of 12 and then it was no issue but

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.880
instead of that i was like

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.279

screaming at music in my bed

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.680
screaming and then it was one of those

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.199
now this is me being very truthful and

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:42.639

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:46.959
like what the [ __ ]

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:49.279
is wrong with me like then that was

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:50.320
another problem

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.959
where i was like how is this just

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:54.320

yeah and then just spazzing yeah

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.560
did we talk about this word you know

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.399
that viral it was like one of the first

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.839
memes of like a kid

00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:04.640
try he was sent to his room or something

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.240
so he starts flopping around on his bed

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.799
and like sticks a remote up his ass

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:10.240
oh yeah yeah yeah i know exactly what

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.079
that is yeah he

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.360
takes it off his bare ass i think

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.280
somebody turned his game off yeah he

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:15.600
doesn't

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.439
stick it up but he just kind of puts it

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:19.199
for a second against his record

00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:21.329
i was like

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.199

about taking his entire operation

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:52.559

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:54.320
absolutely absolutely

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.120
oh no yeah dude exactly yeah so terrible

with organization and that's like a big

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.360
part of

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.720
really you seem pretty strict on

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.880
schedules well because i got this back

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.799
end thing and it's there's you know

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:06.880
there's other people if you were to take

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.120
him down how would you go about it yeah

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.960
just to crumble the empire you couldn't

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.400
you're saying he's totally unassailable

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.679
you couldn't go there there's nothing

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:16.240
you could do to maybe even put like a

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.200
just slice just one cut on the uh on the

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:19.679
like

00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:21.440
like the column could you just put a

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.039
tiny little slice he never confessed to

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:24.400
anything secretly to you

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.559

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:28.400
right yeah and what about inventing some

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.360
sort of skill yeah why don't you just

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.559

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.480
check your white fantasy privilege dude

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.280
you need to stop

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.200
white should just be tackling matt true

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.480
terrorist you know what the

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.039
white paris thing is it's like um why

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:18.320
why's it gonna be worse

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.200
but go ahead oh okay no no of course um

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:21.760
the

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.679
kyle rittenhouse right yeah when he was

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:25.840
shooting people and then the guy was

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.280
well the person was running a hay or

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.520
whatever it is i somebody articulated

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.440
that where you could imagine a scenario

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.080
where

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.520
so kyle rittenhouse thinks he's

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.520
defending himself yeah but then the

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.039
person attacking him

00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:39.840
thinks that he is stopping a a mass

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.960
shooting sure

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.200
so it's like they're both confused as to

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.440
what's going on in the moment

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.679
and that that's you know that would that

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:49.360

like

00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:58.640

very

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.120
well i'll say four on four four on four

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.520
yeah but they got the hoods down the

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.120
hoods are down so they're not

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.280

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.200
yeah hoes are down

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.559

not the spray but literally medieval

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.360
yeah yeah i guess there's just weapons

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.880
on the ground and it's like dodgeball

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.919
you got to run and grab one in the

00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:14.000
middle and then start yeah okay

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.159
uh depends on who's got better training

00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:17.919
bjj training i suppose something like

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:19.760
that

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.159
that yeah i don't know do they do mixed

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:43.120
the sidewalk and the guy came out like

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.440

that sketch is going to be fighting by

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.240
your side who's going to be on my team

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.480
yeah dude and having your back i made

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.679
the mistake

00:33:57.679 --> 00:33:59.840
of telling everyone how much i didn't

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.840
feel like doing this

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.279
so the only thing that's going to happen

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:05.279
is people going to try to make me have a

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:06.880
worse time

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.839
i understand the exact situation dude

00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:10.159
because

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.040
i would be delighted to do this to

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:13.440
somebody

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.520
it's all in your head dude it's not i

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.800
went and assembled it

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.280
dude i had to assemble a team i am kind

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.000
of like a demo

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.240

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.359
thick cigar

00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:30.639
short cigar hanging out

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:35.359
there's blast yeah i don't know i i'll

00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:37.280
it's a game time decision for me

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.079
whatever you've experienced now i have

00:34:40.079 --> 00:34:41.440
also considered the other option which

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.599
is staying at the house by myself

00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:45.839
nice arguably the gayest thing i could

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:47.919
do that's the fattest move

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:50.320
that kid at camp fattest movie it is the

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.280
fattest move

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.560
let's go to the beach now i'm going to

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.960
stay here yeah so i'm starting

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.560
it's tough i'm torn here but then again

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.240
the other fattest move you're talking

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.000
about going to the place of this

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.960
just chilling out the hell oh you're

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.480

that sounds gay i can't think of

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.000

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.230
connor

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.499
[Music]

wow that's a weird no it's always gonna

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.640
be this whole like

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:28.079
this what what were you thinking

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:30.079
incredible i had to fight the [ __ ] out

00:47:30.079 --> 00:47:31.839
of chris yesterday we beefed

00:47:31.839 --> 00:47:33.680
really yeah correct connor would be

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.040
that's all man that's like when the

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.800
fuming started what happened me and him

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.000
just had an argument what are you

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.839
beefing on

00:47:39.839 --> 00:47:43.760
if i even talk about it yeah but

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.520
it's very silly what did the call start

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.960
out as that's always my favorite thing

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.040
this was in person we were in the with

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.800
the beezer just me and the skis

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.920
we're just sitting there watching the

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.520
philippines ski lodge was in the ski

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:53.920
lodge

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.760
yeah and i brought it up

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.160
out of nowhere yeah that a previous

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.680
argument that he and i had had

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.680
out of nowhere i was like six listen to

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.520
this [ __ ] dumb

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.280
[ __ ] and as soon as i brought i mean

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.720
i was just [ __ ] around like it was

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.599
fun

00:48:09.599 --> 00:48:11.760
and then uh it ended up in like a

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.000
screaming match

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.960
i'll tell you the argument and this is

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.160
can you guys do that i'm gonna go get a

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.280
tissue sure sure

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.160
chris is going to be represented poorly

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:22.640
in this

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.559
sure his argument would be that this is

00:48:24.559 --> 00:48:27.359
not true just so we're clear on that

00:48:27.359 --> 00:48:30.960
this is how i saw it so for a while now

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.440
i've told chris this great bit i have

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.440
yeah that i'll never use on stage and

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.400
never film

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.319
it's just a funny thing yeah that if

00:48:38.319 --> 00:48:40.079
aliens landed

00:48:40.079 --> 00:48:41.839
and then we talked to them and it turns

00:48:41.839 --> 00:48:43.680
out they only came here to take

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.680
black people as slaves and we were all

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.599
like you talked about on the cast yes

00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:49.200
talked about on the podcast it all just

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.640
leads to trump talking to black people

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.359
and be like

00:48:51.359 --> 00:48:54.160
you're going to space yeah i said don't

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.280
take the blacks they're taking the

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:55.839
blacks

00:48:55.839 --> 00:48:58.240
yeah that so then when we were driving

00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.839
back from indianapolis

00:48:59.839 --> 00:49:02.079
like two three weeks ago chris was like

00:49:02.079 --> 00:49:03.599
yo i just thought of this this is funny

00:49:03.599 --> 00:49:05.359
what if aliens

00:49:05.359 --> 00:49:07.680
landed and like we met them and they had

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.640
slaves

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.040
yeah and i was like yeah that's like the

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.079
thing i've i told you

00:49:12.079 --> 00:49:13.920
like 10 times right yeah it's like you

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.040
know that's like the thing he's like no

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:15.359
no

00:49:15.359 --> 00:49:16.960
no this is they have them they're not

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.800
like coming down to get them yeah

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.800
and i was like yeah that's the same

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.319
thing it's like that's

00:49:22.319 --> 00:49:24.480
essentially the exact assumption is

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.079
they're taking black people as slaves

00:49:26.079 --> 00:49:28.480
and not just a party with them

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.960
no i've made it clear okay the bit the

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.880
cl the bit was clear that it was

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.359
in enforce slavery should we and and

00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:36.720
that we would be like damn you guys use

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.359
select

00:49:37.359 --> 00:49:39.200
yeah like that okay i got you that's

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.480
been implied sure

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.880
and probably stated anyway so that was

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.079
the beginning of the argument

00:49:44.079 --> 00:49:46.240
chris presented his i said you know i've

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.280
said that to you

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.359
like six times this wasn't like you're

00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:50.880
stealing a bit because

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.160
i've never used it we're not gonna use

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.440
it sure you know what i mean he wasn't

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.559
gonna use it he was just

00:49:54.559 --> 00:49:57.200
making small talk yeah and uh he

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.400
wouldn't relent

00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.680
he would say i just think they're

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.359
totally different yeah i just think

00:50:01.359 --> 00:50:03.359
they're structurally very different

00:50:03.359 --> 00:50:05.599
and i was like how yeah so that was an

00:50:05.599 --> 00:50:07.440
argument for about an hour on the ride

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.599
on the ride so then we get so then

00:50:09.599 --> 00:50:10.960
yesterday we're just sitting there and i

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:11.440
was like

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.760
six six who by the way was in the car

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.720
for the first hour

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.880
sure just not paying attention he's

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.839
playing i was like dude

00:50:17.839 --> 00:50:20.480
listen to how dumb this is and then it

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.680
started an actual fight

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.720
damn yeah if you guys made up yeah he

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.240
tried calling last night twice that was

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.480
his i assumed that was an apology

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.559
decline you declined it declined you

00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:31.920
haven't made up one that was him saying

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:32.880
something he was human

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.640
well i was in the car with uh rainy and

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.319
butterly i didn't want to be on speaker

00:50:36.319 --> 00:50:37.520
crying yeah having a phone

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.079
fight yeah true you know you guys got it

00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:41.760
but

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.680
that's what that that was the fuming got

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.599
you that started you few minutes

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:47.119
i mean that and then it just went right

00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:48.720
into another drama that i'm dealing with

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.160
then it went into

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.760

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.400
the night awesome

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.000

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.440
sweating gripping dog tags

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.920

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.480
yeah the other day i woke her up did i

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.079

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.240
she fell asleep and i like woke her up

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.839
on the couch and i was like wake up and

00:51:27.839 --> 00:51:30.240
she was like

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.880
dude it was the scariest yeah moment of

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.079
it it was so scary

00:51:34.079 --> 00:51:36.000
yeah brittany's like a slime she's she's

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
a time bomb when she sleeps sorry

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.559
she's a time bomb if i come in i'm like

00:51:40.559 --> 00:51:41.200
because if i'm

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.400
if i'm loud it's just like if i'm quiet

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.920
then it's like i'm sneaking up on her

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.839
now and it's like true

00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:49.359
if i come up while she's sleeping and

00:51:49.359 --> 00:51:50.960
she hears me it's just like what's going

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.319
on it's just like oh my god

00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:54.319
what is sleep they're girls they're

00:51:54.319 --> 00:51:55.359
they're dogs they're

00:51:55.359 --> 00:51:57.119
[ __ ] weaker than everybody they're

00:51:57.119 --> 00:51:58.480
scared all the time

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:01.040
how do you wake up well so this is

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.160
that's an unfortunate

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.839
comment that i gotta jump on the back

00:52:03.839 --> 00:52:05.440
because like i'm the one who wakes up

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.280
yelling and screaming really yeah

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.880
apparently i sleep talk

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.839
yeah i swear to talk i'll chat oh i

00:52:11.839 --> 00:52:12.960
apparently yell i'm like

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.839
because the shelves are

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.079
and then uh it is a weird conversation

00:52:18.079 --> 00:52:19.040
you have to have like

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.720
putting on the sleep apnea mass like by

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.319
the way sometimes i

00:52:22.319 --> 00:52:24.079
scream bloody murder my sleep and you

00:52:24.079 --> 00:52:25.680
have a sleep apnea yeah yeah you know

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.119
that

00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:29.359
i forgot somehow yeah somehow i forgot

00:52:29.359 --> 00:52:30.720
that incredible detail

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.440
yeah i got a fat neck that's nice yeah

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.480
do you ever think about like

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.960
tricking out that mask no point like

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:37.920
stickers and stuff

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.359
stickers like flames put like a long wig

00:52:41.359 --> 00:52:44.800
on it that comes down to your shoulders

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.319
you should just get a fighter pilot

00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:48.800
helmet that's basically what it is yeah

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.240
that'd be pretty sick that'd be awesome

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.920
this one is just a nasal cushion though

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.440
so it's like not that invasive

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.960
so it's just you're just on your nose i

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.960
think i need it i mean obviously you can

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.319
look at me and say yeah but like

00:52:58.319 --> 00:52:59.680
i think i need it anyway because there's

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.599
been times where i've woken up like

00:53:01.599 --> 00:53:03.680
yeah like holy [ __ ] was that not

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.760
breathing yeah yeah just get the test

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.440
well i'm not gonna ever do that i'm just

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.800
gonna die in my sleep which does

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.160
gonna fall asleep while driving and go

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.839
off a guardrail yeah well that's not

00:53:11.839 --> 00:53:13.040
that has nothing to do with sleep apnea

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.640
oh yeah oh yeah what do you mean if your

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.079
sleep apnea gets so bad

00:53:16.079 --> 00:53:17.280
you'll eventually start going into

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.880
what's called micro sleeps you'll just

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.079
be like and you'll notice it and then

00:53:20.079 --> 00:53:21.040
eventually you just go

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.000
that was a guy i was telling you about

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.200
who was on an excavator he had sleep

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.040
apnea and he just drove it into a

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:25.920
foundation

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.280
really he just i didn't know that had

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.160
anything to do with sleep apnea

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.520
eventually you'll get so tired from

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:29.920
school

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:30.960
because you're asleep because you're

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.640
slowly sleep depriving yourself but when

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.760
you sleep deprive yourself you don't

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.960
realize you're sleep deprived if you're

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.319
doing like little by little

00:53:36.319 --> 00:53:38.240
and then you're just like man i'm tired

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.839
and then you'll just go

00:53:39.839 --> 00:53:42.400
and pass out one day wow yeah pretty

it's weird hmm joey diaz says the same

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.599
thing he said he smokes weed too early

00:53:59.599 --> 00:54:01.280

i gotta stay i gotta stay up and watch

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.200
youtube videos for an hour and then i'll

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.480
go to sleep

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:14.480
pretty weird yeah but

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.359
do you ever think about getting a hiss

00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:19.280
in here isn't it

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.839
is it hers i just put it on no just put

00:54:21.839 --> 00:54:22.559
it on

00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:25.040
no but uh it'd be hot has a woman been

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.240
staying with you lately

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.480
uh it's very early stages so there was

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.680
just there was just one

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.800
uh one day one date yeah and now date

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.839
number two hopefully

00:54:33.839 --> 00:54:36.400
hopefully yeah nice yeah yeah we we had

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:36.960
dated

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.319
before gotcha so small flame yes yeah

00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:42.319
so that's the best reuniting with an old

00:54:42.319 --> 00:54:44.000
it's really it really is great

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.359
it's nice because there's like a degree

00:54:45.359 --> 00:54:47.920
of comfort ability but then also

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:51.359
what have you learned what about myself

00:54:51.359 --> 00:54:53.599
no i learned that i love you i love

00:54:53.599 --> 00:54:54.880
languages what

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.480
what's your love language uh quality

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.240
time nice quality time

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:02.559
yeah and [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:55:02.559 --> 00:55:04.799
is that part of quality no it's not even

00:55:04.799 --> 00:55:06.079
one it should be like six

00:55:06.079 --> 00:55:07.359
what so what do you mean what's a love

00:55:07.359 --> 00:55:09.599
language uh it's it's like the way you

00:55:09.599 --> 00:55:10.160
show

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.520
different people show affection and

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.839
receive affection in different ways

00:55:13.839 --> 00:55:16.000
so some people are helpers your love

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.520
language might be helping

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.359
i don't think mine's anything no it

00:55:19.359 --> 00:55:21.359
could be the way i mean the idea there

00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:21.839
is that

00:55:21.839 --> 00:55:24.559
some people like fighting fight and i

00:55:24.559 --> 00:55:26.480
were in a relationship

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.480
and the way that i expressed love was

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.160
through acts of service so like i would

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.119
clean the kitchen

00:55:31.119 --> 00:55:33.359
walk the dogs but that to him it's just

00:55:33.359 --> 00:55:34.319
not a big deal

00:55:34.319 --> 00:55:36.559
so i'm doing what i think he should

00:55:36.559 --> 00:55:38.240
really appreciate and he's just like ah

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.599
because he needs quality time he wants

00:55:39.599 --> 00:55:41.359
to sit on the couch and talk

00:55:41.359 --> 00:55:42.640
or he wants me to cuddle him or

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.960
something that's touch yep

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.119
so that's the general idea i hate touch

00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:48.000
or diddle

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.960
yeah i do hate touch diddling's my love

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.640
language

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.720
yeah all right that's fair i think i

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.000
think that might be mine just a little

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:56.960
grabbing ass

00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.400
constantly groping yeah that's almost

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.839
it that's all i don't know if i do

00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:03.839
anything else gardenia

00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:05.040
can you look at you look at the love

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.720
languages so we get a comprehensive uh

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.319
list but i think it is that it's quality

00:56:08.319 --> 00:56:08.880
time

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.960
so i think my language my love language

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.720
is accessible verbal affirmation i can

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:13.280
do

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.280
i say damn [ __ ] you fine as hell there
