00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.120
convinced people that microdosing

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.280

if i slang the script through the cast

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.280
slang in a script was like the hottest

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.720
thing you could do it's just like a very

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.959
high patreon tier every month and then

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.120

i saw some people trying it out for the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.759
first time

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.600

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.280
like brand new

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.000

i saw one coming from near me and then i

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.560
saw one as i got off the

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.320
highway here

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.320
yeah that's it was pretty [ __ ] weird

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.240
mm-hmm yeah i've seen that before like

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.960
yeah like uh eloquent bums

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.919
yeah

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.600
or just like it was their first day for

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.120
sure

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.960
they were trainees there are dudes were

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.320
they younger

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.919
yeah there was a younger guy and there

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.400
was actually a younger-ish lady that

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.759
looked like she was i don't know she was

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.759
dressed like a housewife in like a dress

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.520
dude there's a subgroup of evil hippie

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.680
that is like still into zack like jack

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.759
kerouac living stuff where they're like

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.560
hitchhiking and like hoboing is cool

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.160
so there's a subtle group of evil hippie

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.840
that will like follow weird bands right

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.680
now i know those people those people

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.039
have like

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.479
they're wearing dark colors that are

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.400
fading into this like weird green brown

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.280
color

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.039
and there's they have all had the same

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.560
like skin complexion and like this like

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.960
kind of hair that's turning like orange

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.039
nuts those people are they have the most

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.520
disgusting hat you've ever seen

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.680
in your entire life

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.280
they have sick backpacks

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.080
the backpack game is

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.759
they've all got a sleeping dog that's

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.120
just like sitting there they have a

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.039
well-trained yeah well-trained the most

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:18.720
well-trained dog in the world i think

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720
they're doing process of elimination i

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.000
think if you're just bumming around a

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.840
dog naturally gravitates towards you and

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.520
they probably watch like seven dogs get

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.240
hit by cars

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.759
just somehow stays next to you and

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.479
you're like this is my dog now yeah okay

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.520
this is my dog yeah this is enable these

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.199
cross punks are an evolutionary event

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.240
for dogs

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.520
yeah i thought about that the other day

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.639
about like when people oh it's the worst

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:41.919
when they have a guitar though and

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.840
they're playing that terrible music that

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.000
they play i've never seen one playing oh

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.880
dude

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.120
i mean it's just absolutely

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.759
i don't know it's the set it's the

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.440
worst [ __ ] in the world

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.960
i don't know how to describe it i've

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.319
never yeah i've never really passed them

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.599
into slow enough speed you're playing

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:59.199
like alcoholic

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.560
folk music

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.400
i hate when i see couples when they're

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.319
coupling homeless couples yeah some

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.479
[ __ ] bro yeah that's unfortunate i i

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:08.400
that's what i start i feel that uh the

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.919
same way people feel about homeless

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.400
people with dogs when i see

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.680
like a homeless man a little [ __ ]

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.560
he's clearly controlling her mind at

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.720
that point he got to be yeah that's like

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.680
clearly an abusive relationship

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.280
no way that's not an abusive no it could

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.960

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.039
[ __ ] like that's what it's supposed to

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:50.879
happen yeah we're talking about a player

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:52.960
talking about a player though

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.520
he's not gonna play himself

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:04.960
homeless player would be why they

situation you know yeah

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.680
true

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.680

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.879
keep him close

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:20.240

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.159
most

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.680
that'd be a wild existence dude as a

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.440

this

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.519
i don't know why i genuinely thought

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:11.760

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.320

[Laughter]

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.399

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.160
it if they weren't such [ __ ] so annoying

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.399
but it would just be like the other way

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:41.600
around where it's like the people

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.920
actually using it would be

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.079
that it would dude i mean you got to

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:48.000
scorch your brain to eat that kind of

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
[ __ ] yeah

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.959
imagine though like what percentage

00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:54.560
there are like you know obviously like

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.760
you know if you bring

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.200
girls into a space where there's like an

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.600
active glory hole too nine out of ten

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.920
girls are gonna make what the [ __ ] but

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.079
there is that [ __ ] the one out of ten

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:07.040
bottom of the barrel woman yeah who sees

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.320

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.360
hell yeah dude oh my god there are women

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.640

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.480
they gotta be quiet they can't tell

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.360
anyone

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.360
they can't tell anyone that they love

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.959
glory

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:22.240
i mean dude that would like ruin a

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.839
girl's french do they mask it in a

00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:25.760
hatred of the patriarchy

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.839
i think so do you think you think the

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:29.760
feminists really just want to say

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.760
dude i think they just want to [ __ ]

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.120
put two fingers through and wait for a

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.360
dog

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.240
there's there's no way there's any women

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.120
in glory holes it's got to be all dudes

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.720
dude don't tell me that that's a lie

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.640
dude

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.720
if there's ever been one woman

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.360
that might be the last great myth

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.880
yeah

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.639
no true i think i don't think they're

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:53.839
any i don't think women i think that

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:56.079
goes against like their biology like sit

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:57.279
on this other end of the hole and just

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:58.880
wait that goes back to like cave times

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.680
like yeah no way it doesn't feel right

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.200
either like when you hear female

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.720
comedians talking about how they like

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.160

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.519
you know what i mean it's also it's just

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:15.040
unsettling it's not like not in a mean

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.120
way but that's like it's very serious

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.279

she would have a business network

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.880
immediately

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.560

as like almost like medic i give like a

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.920
medical she would have a like month-long

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.120
waiting list

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.279

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.320

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.839
the side what do you say

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.720

of them for the rest of this time

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.360
that's what girls are [ __ ] up to they

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.040
could fully take over

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.480
dude a [ __ ] pyramid scheme would be

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.440
nasty

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.360
there's just one chick who's on getting

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.480
unlocked through like a pure of a

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.800
network of dudes i think this is what if

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.639
you did just financially control a woman

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.839
and then like

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:46.079
she like she was at your control and you

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:47.839
just used her to crush your own friend

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:50.320
group like like a honey pot yeah you

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.079
just you just strategically bounced her

00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:53.440
around to completely destabilize

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.399
everyone

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:56.480
you're describing the cai cia dude it's

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.720
a honeypot mission true you get young

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.920
girls

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.680
and you just traffic them and you just

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.480
go

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.320
oh you [ __ ] that chick yeah she was 15

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.240
dude and she's not from this country no

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.800
but i think i look like bro sending the

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.440
chick to infiltrate the group and like

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.959
destroy them that way is that what you

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:14.399
were talking about

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:16.560
yeah yeah like psychologically [ __ ] them

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.639
all and [ __ ] yeah like do all this stuff

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:20.399
or or what if you were just really good

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:22.240
at using this girl and you kept all your

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.320
boys very pleased

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.000
what have you

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.240
so before you well it depends on how

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.240
they're basically you basically get an

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.000
exclusive contract with this prostitute

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.680

yeah dude they're dude that's what uh

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.360
you know a lot of people think we're too

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.360
repressed but like there are there were

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.800
societies that were completely worth

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.320
yesterday so like

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.759
there were societies where like you guys

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:28.560
all had to get down dude like you would

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.000
see your cousin

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.279
just butt [ __ ] you have to you have

00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:33.360
to put on a show you had to you to put

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.279
on for your whole family dude you

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.480
imagine that when like you were having

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.600
sex like your mom was like not that far

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.120
in those orgy asking communities i don't

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.240
think they broke you up but i don't

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.839
think like i don't know how that worked

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:44.880
yeah

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.240
i mean maybe they're not real maybe

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.839
there wasn't this never happened but

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:49.040
there's people who are out there saying

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.759
like there was orgiastic communities

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:53.759
yeah it would just be like full it was a

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:55.519
full session what would you do just

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:57.040
everything was just like invite another

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.720
family over for a feast and everybody

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.240
would just [ __ ] i don't know maybe it

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.519
was like a tribe i think it's like a

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:02.959
tribe type thing

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:04.240
you'd be hunting and gathering but like

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.520
when it was time there were just like

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.760
weird rituals where like it was [ __ ]

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.559
dancing bears or something

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:12.160
that was the thing but the whole fan was

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.319
there yeah that's weird

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.640
there's nowhere to go they're sisters

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.959
it's like

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.760
there was no such thing as a room you

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.600
were just inside or outside that was

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.039
like there's probably a lot of day times

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:30.080
[ __ ] in the woods dude yeah

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.120
they were probably pretty serious

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.440
yeah yeah you know i don't know man that

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.720
could have been an easy like i guess

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.240
then but now everyone else was clocking

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.440
everybody else so like if a chick

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.120
stepped away for 20 minutes the other

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.720
babes would be like

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.320
where the [ __ ] is she

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.440
so i don't know if anyone i don't know

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.640
if you could like pop out real quick and

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.679
get you know you don't think there was a

00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:49.520
heck of a hunt just like running around

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.559
a little bit

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:52.240
i don't know i don't know yeah i mean

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.919
dude it'd be imagine how hard everyone

00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:56.080
was in each other's business back then

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.760
because you could like dip out [ __ ] some

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.480
dude's husband in the woods dip back in

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.520
it's like there must have been like

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.039
total suspicion around that all the time

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:06.160
i i do think a lot of the the the the

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.080
modern social structure is why we kind

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.000
of like revert it into each other's

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.200
business

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.559
do you know what i mean i think when

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.080
when things were like kind of more free

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.880
and open open living spaces i don't i

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.880
don't know if people were that much into

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.200
each other's businesses unless they

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.720
unless they posed a threat dude there

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.320
was one there was this one society i

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.360
forget where they were but they used to

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.200
all carry on sticks and like the oldest

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.320
dude was supposed to have the biggest

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.840
stick but it was like a

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.360
it's supposed to like symbolize your

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.840
dong yeah and then you would like if you

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.039
wanted to [ __ ] somebody's wife you'd

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:37.360
take your donk staff and you would tap

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.200
the window if you knew the dude was out

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.559
you would like tap her window and you

00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:42.240
would [ __ ] if she like grabbed your donk

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.440
staff she'd come out and smash

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.559
dude that was a society yeah that i read

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:50.860
about one time that pretty sure existed

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.640
[Laughter]

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.400
i believe every word of that dude you

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.840
had a donk staff and you walked around

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.039
you're like damn you're looking good you

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:00.799
just you'd rattle the door real quick

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:02.080
she'd be like

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.240
yeah there's like uh i hope we didn't

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.520
talk about this before but there's an

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.880
african culture

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.919
where

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:09.120
it's uh

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.640
you know like deep deep maybe it was

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.720
like south america too i don't know like

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.080
they all start sounding and looking the

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.840
same at some point documentary wise

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.240
right yeah but basically when the old

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.720
people get useless to the culture

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.520
anymore you're allowed to go up and like

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.360
bop him in the head and kill him really

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.440
yeah drag them off

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.919
and i do i it just cracks me up the idea

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.919
of trying to look young and hip your

00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:33.679
whole time

00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:37.640
[ __ ] cracked yeah

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.799
yeah it's weird to think about like you

00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:42.799
know we live in one type of setup dude

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:45.120
there's probably thousands of setups

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.360
there's some setups out there some wild

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.039
yeah whole just the whole thing is

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:50.880
completely flipped around if you got to

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.039
design a setup from the ground up like

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:54.960
what would you go with

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.039
oh boy what are what are some elements

00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:59.520
of like a good setup uh hobbit houses

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.400
for sure wow i'm going right off the bat

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.320
full hobbit houses

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.880
okay i'm into big eco-future mode yeah

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.960
like if you can't find a hill to build a

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.000
home in

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.919
you don't have a home yeah you have to

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:13.520
figure it out exactly or you could be a

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.200
tree person true you could leave the

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.799
tree dwellers oh that's due to tree

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.320
villages and [ __ ] like that slightly

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.480
yeah now we're talking yeah tree village

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.840
but they're like slightly elven and

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.280
somewhat light yeah you're a little bit

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.080
yeah i'm more i'm more of like the earth

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.360
of the earth but i could see people

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.559
getting the trees and i would respect

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:30.640
them honestly honestly yeah it's like

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.480
you don't understand their ways but it's

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.840
clear that it's like you know their

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.799
their hearts are in the right yeah like

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.720
if say my son wanted to date like a tree

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.240
person i'd be like

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.600
i understand

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.679
i'm confused by your actions me as the l

00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:42.880
person i'd be a little bit more

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.559
judgmental and probably even against it

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:49.039
you know what i think i would support

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:50.880
being against it a little more yeah

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.880
right because like once you start

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.520
allowing that sort of like uh

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.120
that sort of mating then you just get

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.440
regular ground people mm-hmm do you know

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.799
what i mean no

00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:02.159
they'll start to rebel like they're not

00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:03.600
going to be tree people because you know

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.960
how interracial couples can get all

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.200
weird not not the cool ones sure no

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.480
there's like a lot of cool interracial

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.000
cause you can go wrong with it really

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.679
hard exactly you can go real wrong then

00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:14.320
you rebel so you're not you're neither

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.799
living in the hills like hobbit houses

00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:18.880
yeah you're not in the trees right so

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.880
you just start making

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.919
house like

00:21:21.919 --> 00:21:23.280
that's yeah you're building structures

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.640
you're going to say you're back to once

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.480
you mix yeah once you start mixing kind

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.400
this is the root of lame setup we'll be

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.520
back and

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.799
yeah we'd be back in philadelphia it's

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:32.400
only a matter of time i'm also i'm not

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.840
saying this because sydney's black but

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.559
sydney would make an incredible orc

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:37.760
i feel like i have organized do you

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.679
think so dude

00:21:39.679 --> 00:21:42.640
from actually to be an orokai for sure

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.760
yeah for sure dude hello kai

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.760
are you okay with that i think i am i

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.600
think i have natural warrior tendencies

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.760
i think that's what the orc class is

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.640
true

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.840
they are

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.760
it's like i'm i'm like an orc runt

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.960
yeah

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.799
i mean you know yeah the elves were an

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:05.120
army by the way by the way orcs

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.520
were made from i think either the elves

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.640
or something higher than the elves they

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.400
like corrupted them to make the work so

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:10.960
it's not like they're not powerful it's

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.960
not like they don't rule it's not like

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.320
exactly it's not like they do not really

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.600
i think if people take that that's not a

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.280
complicated class yeah they don't know

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.600
enough this is like this dude saw either

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.520
like elves or like whatever was up there

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.559
and he was like

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:25.360
i could probably do a little bit better

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.880
that's that's what a works came from you

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.120
sure about you sure about that though

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.880
i'm pretty sure well i know i would be

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.400
unfortunate i'll talk fast and loose

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.679
about a lot of things in a long time i

00:22:33.679 --> 00:22:37.039
want to talk to chain of power about lot

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:38.400
it's been a long time since i cracked

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.400
the red book of west march but

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.480
i believe that's the origin of the uh

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.919
orcs of the order i've always felt the

00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:46.000
pulling towards the orcs

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.440
how do you that book should have like a

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.640
lock that you have to stick your dick

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.360
into while you read it

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:06.400
that's a good dude that would be a good

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.159
exercise that you can't come until you

00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:10.720
finish all of the lord of the rings

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.360
that's a sick no fap dude yeah you got

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.880
to read all the lord of the rings and

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.320
then as soon as you finish the last one

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.600
you can release have you ever read lord

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.440
of the rings no i watched the movie dude

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.919
it's so good dude i i can only imagine

00:23:21.919 --> 00:23:23.039
it's one of those things where it's like

00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:24.400
people talk about how good it is to the

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.520
point where people are just like it's

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.960
actually kind of lame and it's like no

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.320
but it's really good we're on like the

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.919
fifth level of like going back and forth

00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:32.080
between it being actually sick and being

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.000
like kind of like lame and overplayed

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.440
lord of the rings yeah but it is

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.440
actually actually sick dude the movies

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.039
were like a religious experience for me

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:41.120
i watched them i re-watched them this

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.480
year and i was like dude this should be

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.840
like standard this would be part of

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.200
public education watching lord of the

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.600
rings that was uh seeing the lord of the

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.799
ring movies

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:50.799
we saw those movies because amsley read

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:53.279
the books so like her being able to pick

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:55.760
movies for the rest of our relationship

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.760
it hinged it didn't hinge it turned

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.679
because of that like that was like all

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:01.600
right you got the green light i'll i'll

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.279
[ __ ] give you i'll give everything

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:05.679
you got a shot really yeah

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:07.440
i've always been a fool i always just

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.520
watched everything and like whatever

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.600
no i was uh yo would you well you shut

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.360
down a tv what's the tv situation in

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.880
your house oh i mean dude since that

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.400
moment we're open i'm opening this

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.760
overnight yeah

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.600
i'll sit down next to anything she's

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.279
watching and give it a shot like i mean

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:22.880
i'll make fun of it sure because i mean

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.559
i am who i am but yeah i'll give

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:26.720
anything she's watching i'm like

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.720
you will write that one time

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.200
i don't wanna i don't wanna miss another

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.760
lord of the rings experience wow oh man

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.760
if you just if you're just like on lord

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.159
of the rings that's tough

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:40.640
i mean honestly if that that would have

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.400
probably changed our relationship

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.240
i think because then then her picking

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.039
movies that would have been a

00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:46.880
contentious situation

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.120
and because like a bae can only last for

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.600
so long not having certain authorities

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.960
yeah and it is tough to shut down

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.559
somebody's dude i have a thing where

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:56.000
like playing music for people i'd like

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
rather show than my penis dude

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.440
i hate when i play when i put on tunes

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.799
i'm like dude i hope they like these

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:02.880
tunes dude oh i hope they like these

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.240

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.240
people tunes yeah that's just a thing

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.360
you know it's a big deal it makes me

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.039
laugh all the time i always get so

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:10.559
nervous but dude i hope they [ __ ]

00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:13.039
it's just crazy that i like this one

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:14.960
i've started to enjoy actually because i

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.240

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.039

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:19.840
like

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.080
genuinely enjoy sitting down for the

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.919
90th episode of a show i've never even

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:25.760

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.440
three or four seasons of dexter and then

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.679
i watched the finale i was like

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:51.120
i can't believe i cared about this i

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.480
might start strictly watching alleys who

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.159
did someone in our group recommend the

00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:59.120
spartacus tv show that was on like stars

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.200
or whatever yeah have you ever seen that

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.000
show

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.840
that's a show i never hear about it did

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.600
you tell you to watch that no i watched

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.679
it like 10 years ago spud's a big

00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:13.200
proponent and then my wife and i got

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.039
very upset when the original actor who

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:16.960
played spartacus died of cancer r.i.p

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.399
dude you guys are watching it in real

00:27:18.399 --> 00:27:20.960
time i it was either real time or

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.120
shortly after spartacus is one of the

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.840
most slept on show dude ever dude

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.200

completely owned by his dominus

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.399
so like there was a lady who just like

00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:50.799
owned this gladiator she'd summon him up

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:52.640

is that work stuff i mean that's the way

00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:08.320
i felt like my sex life went

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.919
weird sexual orgasm yeah i felt like i

00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:11.440
was being demanded by sexually

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.520
aggressive women to come [ __ ] them all

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.000
the time

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.799
i never i felt like i did i really feel

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:20.159
like i missed out on that like i never

00:28:20.159 --> 00:28:22.320
felt like i cleverly

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.559
managed my way into [ __ ]

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:27.679
you know so you watched all of lotr

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:29.520
yeah you're okay with him calling you at

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.960
work

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.559
i mean again there's a whole different

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:33.919
world i can't i've i haven't been able

00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:35.679
to have like the book the bro i don't

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:37.600
want to be an elf yeah i don't want to

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.279
be an elf i'm just what would you rather

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:42.840
be i don't know for orc be honest

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.279
tim tim

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:47.039
the point you're making the point that i

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:48.799
get that's a better one would you rather

00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:49.919
be

00:28:49.919 --> 00:28:50.799
probably

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:53.279
an elf

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.799
yeah but also kind of gay true

00:28:56.799 --> 00:28:58.720
but

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.480
dude they have so much secret magic

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.840
powers

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.760
yeah but they're kind of gay

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.440
there are the gays of the people in lord

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.279
of the rings yes

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:10.240
easily by far easily and by far

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.159
come home although those hobbits hobbits

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:14.320
are a little gay too no hobbits have it

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.440
right no

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.600
hobbits have it all figured out nothing

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.600
but disadvantages and fun that was no

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.960
that was the one thing that i think they

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.159
left out of the movies i think that's in

00:29:22.159 --> 00:29:23.679
the books a lot like all the gay hobbit

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:26.679
sex

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.279
i'm going to start writing that

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:32.240
gay hobbits just writing just like deep

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.559
intricate fantasy work like weird gay

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:36.480
fantasy scenes out of nowhere i mean

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.919
actually that's just george r martin he

00:29:37.919 --> 00:29:39.200
did this

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.720
tip the hat to the candy he already did

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.320
this yeah i think maybe when you read

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.000
the books the orcs are probably the

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.039
coolest

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:47.200
it'd be hard to not make them

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.799
cool

00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:50.080
again i remember the [ __ ] they're

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.000
serving the ring dude every time they

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.200
showed an orc on screen in lord of the

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.840
rings it like flexed a muscle you know

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.000
something it's certainly like grunted

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.760
that's the most powerful it's reserving

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.440
the ring dude they're all serving the

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.640
ring in some way though don't you

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.760
understand

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.360
don't understand the point of the entire

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.440
series that's fair

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.559
that's fair

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:09.840
good point

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.880
did you ever do did you ever like

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.159
seriously sit and think about how hard

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:15.200
it'd be to throw the ring away

00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:18.640
i thought about that the whole dude i've

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.240
had this with like returning a phone

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.720
charger i found in my car

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.080
i think there's no way i can get this

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.320
back

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.919
i would not even consider

00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:31.679
power i would definitely justify just

00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:33.440
like no one needs to know about this

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.399
yeah

00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:37.919
i've like genuinely thought about like

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.760
cody you thought dude everyone like i'd

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.520
watch him like come on sam it's just a

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.039
ring dude but like

00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:44.880
that is when you start thinking about

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.799
like having all of power at your

00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:49.039
fingertips yeah being like no i totally

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:50.960
throw it in the volcano bro and then

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.799
would you on top of that

00:30:52.799 --> 00:30:54.720
after everything you did you're like i

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.039
feel like i kind of earned this right

00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:58.159
yeah then you want that you've got like

00:30:58.159 --> 00:31:00.000
a soot and dirt all over your face like

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.640
your your fingers are all cut up yeah

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.960
you get bit by you lost like 60 pounds

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.840
you're like i i kind of feel like if i

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.600
want to keep this that's up to me that's

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.640
what happened to frodo at the end

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.240
basically exactly he was like dude you

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.159
know what i think i can handle this

00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:16.559
thing yeah yeah yeah i think i've got

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:18.640
this far why you know i think it'll be

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.760
screaming to you i mean that's what i

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.799
was thinking the whole time i was

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:22.159
watching it i was like well he's a he's

00:31:22.159 --> 00:31:23.760
a hobbit i could probably actually

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.279
[ __ ] handle that you think you'd

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:26.960
handle that yeah

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.600
i could manage that it's the ring dude i

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.360
get it it's the ring

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.039
but i at least listen

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:35.279
i i would definitely uh

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:37.519
consider myself a class of human that

00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:39.840
didn't really get uh exist or get

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.279
represented in the movie the lord of the

00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:42.320
rings i don't know if they exist in the

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.600
book side wait so are you are you going

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.360
humankind or ken i need to know for this

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.960
debate uh it was definitely probably

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.720
like you have to tell me human hybrid

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.320
hold on one second so sydney are you

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.399
telling me that you would you would keep

00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:54.480
the ring and just manage it i'd see

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.640
here's the you got to hear me out

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.360
you gotta hear me out

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.039
i think i should just have it okay dude

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:06.320
but yeah

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.279
but

00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:10.080
i would come from a class of people that

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.760
dedicated their lives to being able to

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.600
handle it if they got it do you know

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.840
what i mean mm-hmm like like it was like

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.799
thrust upon frodo the humans said the

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:20.480
humans weren't evil with it dude yeah

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.240
yeah i would that was

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.120
every time or human hybrid

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.840

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.120
little bit i don't know what about

strip clubs and we're like wow oh

00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:37.760
yeah dude they're not really like my

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.200
thing he's like i think strip club

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.720
should be illegal man

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.480
we're like okay cool he's like it's just

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.400
like it should just be a crime to like

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.560
take a woman for granted and we're just

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.480
like damn yeah

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.280
yeah

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.200
i he had he had

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.599
he had a pretty good setup in his head

00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:54.960
and he was just breaking it down yeah

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.640
dude you're just describing this dude

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.040

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:07.110
[Laughter]

00:39:07.359 --> 00:39:09.520
he is right now partly radicalized i

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.599
think it should be a crime to take a

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:14.160
woman and her beauty for granted dude if

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.839
isis just stopped cutting off people's

00:39:15.839 --> 00:39:17.359
hands and just saying what the [ __ ] bro

00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:19.359
instead they'd have boys

00:39:19.359 --> 00:39:21.119
what the [ __ ] bro what the [ __ ] bro what

00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:22.640
the [ __ ] bro it'd be a way bigger

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.320
movement okay so what wait so what would

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.800
it be a crime man what was his what else

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.119
what else entailed his setup that he

00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:31.040
explained danny hit me with some details

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.640
what was this dude all about besides

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.520
that

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.640
[Music]

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.440
okay women are more valuable women women

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.680
can create life he said so they carry

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.760
more value inherently

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.200
like mystical feminists getting into

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.440
mystical feminism [ __ ] rules i said

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.040
you've got some great ideas maybe you

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.800
start being like they are the planet it

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.320
got a little bit squirrely by the end of

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.160
the ride the more detail you added were

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.680
like okay dude

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.000
dude i'm already there i'm already like

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.599
that first thing like women are more

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:03.839
valuable

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.520
he started off so hot and the ride was

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.200
long enough that it was always just

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.319
gonna get he also he's also practicing

00:40:12.319 --> 00:40:13.839
by the end he's like he's like i think

00:40:13.839 --> 00:40:15.280
if you marry a woman and she has kids

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.680
man you should be able to kill them

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.359
yeah i am a little hypocritical about it

00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:20.880
because like i do

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.119
like in i do treat anthony that way she

00:40:23.119 --> 00:40:25.200
really am she's she she's a sacred human

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.400
being to me but

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.720
god is my earth mother basically

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.640
but i'm hypocritical but i'm like these

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.160
other [ __ ] though

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.800
dude you know well first of all

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.560
i had something to say about the dude

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.240
what the [ __ ] i totally forget about the

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.400
uber driver stabin

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.319
yeah so dude

00:40:42.319 --> 00:40:45.200
he was just practic he's on he's like

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.440
workshopping he has material for every

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.040
chick that gets in the car so he's

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.040
workshopping like the craziest

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.640
girlfriend he was trying to

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.000
he was trying to hit us with his truck

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.599
yeah he was just driving practicing his

00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:58.079
five minutes he has for trips

00:40:58.079 --> 00:40:59.280
i don't know man i just [ __ ] handle

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.800
something about me i hate strip clubs

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.359
don't get them

00:41:05.359 --> 00:41:06.800
i think women are more important to men

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.040
you know

00:41:09.359 --> 00:41:12.000
just spit in the ultimate gym yeah that

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.599
is that is produced nothing gets chicks

00:41:13.599 --> 00:41:15.280
wetter than mystical feminism like you

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.079
guys are kaia

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.040
yeah he was saying women are too

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.119
materialistic yeah but when you're like

00:41:27.119 --> 00:41:29.760
that's them buying into uh

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.520
taking themselves for granted

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.720
they're like

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.000
you know you can flip that that's an

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.079
easy flick dude girls when it comes to

00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:39.359
shopping are [ __ ]

00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:41.920
like they're [ __ ] yeah

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.640
why how so they just buy the dumbest

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.920
[ __ ]

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.480
from real life experience it's like yeah

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.520
okay

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.599
although although i i take that i would

00:41:51.599 --> 00:41:53.920
say i was saying that for comedic effect

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.240
card companies to get them to be able to

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.560
put more money on the credit card this

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.480

he knows what's up

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.079
so he can make some more convince that

00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:05.680
institution that's loaning me this at an

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.359
astronomical rate that i should have

00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:09.680
more yeah yeah and the lady yeah that

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.680
was uh you get [ __ ] on credit cards i

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.880
wonder if he thinks that like when you

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.640
max out a credit card the interest that

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.560
they charge is like it's at the ceiling

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.240
dude your limit's five thousand dollars

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.400
you can't owe more than five thousand

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:25.280
i had his limit was less than a thousand

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.319
because hey we've been there the the

00:44:28.319 --> 00:44:29.200
purchase

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.839
the purchase total came up to like just

00:44:31.839 --> 00:44:33.920
over four thousand and he was splitting

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.839
it between three different credit cards

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:37.760
and he had to get it bumped up to handle

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.760
the math of that what if he laid in the

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.680
mattress with like financial anxiety the

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.839
whole time

00:44:43.839 --> 00:44:45.119
how am i gonna pay these credit cards

00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:46.480
off well

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.400
that was another woman

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.240

if you could finance something then

00:46:11.359 --> 00:46:13.280

you could get it like 300 a month you

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.280
could probably get the nastiest mattress

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.880
on the market how old is it going to be

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:47.680

like two years old how many miles

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:55.520
like a 70 year old died off

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.200

interchange like 476 in this overpass i

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.319
just looked at the cars and meditated

00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:24.079
the whole entire time pretty sick yeah

00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:25.520
and then she kept commenting on how

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.680

suave oh so

00:50:25.599 --> 00:50:27.200
real quick what i was gonna say so the

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.520
first night we uh when we moved we

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.960
couldn't we couldn't get our box big up

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.119
there so we slept with our mattress on

00:50:33.119 --> 00:50:35.119
the floor and we were that was like the

00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:36.800
best night of sleep that we had in years

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.400
it's nice and that that's when we

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.400
realized box springs

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.319
like the box spring you get [ __ ]

00:50:42.319 --> 00:50:44.480
matters really yeah because i went back

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.240
and looked at the box spring like

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.319
everywhere where i had back discomfort

00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:50.319
where i woke up there was like there was

00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:52.480
enough space in the box screen box

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.960
spring for the mattress to like dip a

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.119
little bit like the most important yeah

00:50:57.119 --> 00:51:00.000
i just feel so zenned out in the low bed

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.359
the low beds are i'm gonna see if i'm

00:51:01.359 --> 00:51:02.720
gonna mattress on the ground i'm very

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.760
comfortable

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.960

mattress on the floor

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.440

days a few weeks yeah take her to the

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.800

no curtains no blinds in our house

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.319

adult life with the family there's some

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.040

he would handle it

01:04:04.079 --> 01:04:05.359

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.800
coops i yeah that's uh

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.000
you can't be in a relationship and have

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.560
a coupe i've decided i i saw a guy pick

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.000
up his kid in a coop the other day and i

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:44.880
went

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.239
yeah

01:10:46.239 --> 01:10:48.080
coupe energy he just kept that coop

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.520
energy

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:51.840

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.280
dude

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.960
yeah no i don't know why it like it like

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.360
attracts a certain type of people too

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.159
like i would i would that coupe like

01:11:00.159 --> 01:11:01.920
that is the car for people that are

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.520
looking to cheat on their wives i think

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.320
so

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.480
it's like i think yeah because it's like

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.080
uh yeah you can

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.920
get in if you want but i've got it's the

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.560
most uncomfortable setup that's i always

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.159
wanted to sedan so my bros in the back

01:11:14.159 --> 01:11:16.400
can be comfortable as hell but but for

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.640
the eclipse i mean there was barely any

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.840
room back there like their heads would

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.880

01:11:22.239 --> 01:11:24.400
of this yeah that's all that's all

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.080
that's what a coop is it's a car for two

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.000
normal seats that fit two teenage girls

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.640
behind you yeah that's what a cube's for

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.800

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.840
is probably they probably have a nicer

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.360
