00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.600
day after i take acid

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.919
remember being a ufc and and smoking

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.520
like you know in the smoking area

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.880

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.639
oakland coliseum

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.840
um but then they did away with it

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.800
because you can't smoke in california

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.000
can't smoke uh

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.280
cigarettes in california anywhere

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.440
please tell me i'm recording this i um

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.800
uh you can't smoke weed anywhere in

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.919
california so they're like hey this you

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.440
can't use this for cigarette smoking and

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.160
me and duncan trussell were out there

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160
and i asked the guy i was like the guy

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.360
who's like hey no smoking out here i

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.639
think duncan was smoking back then i

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:29.600
think i was too

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.600
and he was like hey no smoking we're at

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.039
a ufc

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:34.560
and uh we're like what about weed he

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.360
goes it's a medical state

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.160
so no smoking cigarettes but absolutely

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.199
yes smoking

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.160
at oakland coliseum no not open coliseum

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.360
wherever the [ __ ]

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.479
uh warriors played before the

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.479
team abandoned the city that supported

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.919
them

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.000
what the [ __ ] is that they [ __ ]

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.080
supported you forever and you're like no

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.919
better stadium across town san francisco

00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:59.199
so most people understand the difference

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.400
in san francisco and oakland you're like

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.479
sister cities it's not oakland's the

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:03.280
[ __ ]

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.280
lives in the shadow of san fran they're

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.639
way more of a homer town

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.479
nobody moves to oakland people move to

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:10.880
san francisco to like be trendy

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.280
oakland is a [ __ ] homer town and they

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.880
suck in support of the warriors the

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:43.599

still kind of illegal in california goes

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.879
the only way you'll get caught is if you

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:57.039

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:58.400

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.840
pretty much only smoke in the car

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.840
it helps traffic lights go by faster

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.800
otherwise what are you gonna do play

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.440
with the radio there's already a song on

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.960

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.599
my friends

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:17.280

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.159
china

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:40.000
how long is this 9.56 i wonder how lo

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.080
i've never done a live

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.440
[ __ ] intro outro before

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.600
if you're just tuning in we are live

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.080
coast to coast and across the world on

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.120
stereo app

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.160
um write in some questions or uh not

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:54.880
write in

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.080
leave me a message um so i was in china

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.800
and they said it's hash there they don't

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.519
so they have

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:03.040
it's like strict drug laws but they

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.560
don't really care about the drugs that

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.839
um white people do

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:08.880
they only care about the drugs that

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.040
chinese people do and if you're like

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.640
well there's also black people right

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.360
uh the answer is not really no not in

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.120
china it's pretty much the only expats

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.720
or white expats

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.519
occasionally koreans but um

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:24.800
yeah they don't care about wheat and

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.760
they don't know what it smells like

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.640
because it's so

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.160
none of the asians none of the chinese

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.080
usually use it so they

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.320
hate opium if you try to bring opium in

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.200
they'll [ __ ]

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.839
they might like put you in jail um

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.800
coke from what i understand they'll kick

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.360
you out

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.800
don't try to bring it but if you have if

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.680
you get caught with it there they'll

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.640
kick you out

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.480
but i told the story before the beijing

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.680
there was a beijing comic

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.120
or someone in the beijing comedy scene

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.640
maybe a girlfriend or something she got

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.600
caught with coke

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.519
and they kicked her out of china they

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:55.120
stamped a passport

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.440
never allowed to return to china ever

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.920
put on a plane back to america she

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.120
landed

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.519
in new york city jfk international

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:06.800
airport

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.920
went home got a steamer

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.720
from her mom's closet steamed that stamp

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.360
out

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.440
got on a flight back to china the next

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.040
day and

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.000
it was still over there two years later

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.600
they didn't know anything online

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.279
all right when a country outlaws google

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:25.760
they don't [ __ ] search your name

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.880
because the people on the border are

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.560
going to be like oh searchlight dude it

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.079
would have been so easy to smuggle weed

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:31.440
over the border in china

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.600
because it's punishable by death they

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.079
just didn't care

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:37.360
that's good was like i should take some

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.120
like don't take the chance and he goes

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.079
would you guys

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:41.279
i would not have gotten caught but don't

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:42.480
take the chance and i don't know if he

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.880
did or not

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.079
anyway in china they said the hash

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:51.040

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.920

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.799
what's your question he goes uh

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:27.280
do you want to [ __ ]

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.720
you know i was like

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.480
i mean it catches you out of the blue

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.240
more for a dude than a woman i got to

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.840
expect a woman like

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.480
is always on the ready jen kirkman used

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.919
to do a bit about it how like

00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:43.760
every one of her guy friends at some

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.120
point she has to treat like a dog and go

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:45.840
like no

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.520
no like she sees him about to hit on her

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.600
and she goes no we're just friends

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.360
so like they're like ready for guys to

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.000
hit on them when it's not like expected

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.440
but i do straight dudes are not ready

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.640
for that and i was

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.679
not ready for that

00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:04.000
um

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.360
and so uh what was it gonna say so um

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.919
yeah i was like no no thanks i don't you

00:23:11.919 --> 00:23:13.840
know no offense i just i

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.120
i don't want to [ __ ]

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.720
pulls and uh and he goes oh okay and it

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.520
was just kind of

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.360
awkward it was it was a bold move on his

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.640
part

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.880
and then he was like you want to hang

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.840
out just talk

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.760
and be friends and i was like oh no dude

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.960
that ship has sailed

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.480
you can't pull back from do you want to

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.080
[ __ ] to like

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.159
let's see what we have in common also

00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:37.120
it's not like

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.679
you went too fast you're just never

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:41.360
interested it wasn't gonna happen

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.720
you know why because i don't [ __ ]

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.360
foreign dudes

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.360
um but

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.080
later i think the next day the day after

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:52.720
i reached

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.480
whatever pants i was wearing that day

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.159
and i found his number again

00:23:56.159 --> 00:23:58.400
and then you know what struck me he

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.400
already had his number written down on a

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.520
piece of paper

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.919
he didn't pass by and say hey i'd love

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:05.279
to hang out here's my number and write

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:06.480
it down

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.320
i think he couldn't afford business

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.600
cards

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.200
i think he wrote his phone number down

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.039
on a bunch of pieces of paper

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:14.640
and was just looking for people i don't

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.320
know if he had a thing for foreigners

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.960
or i wandered through the [ __ ] gay

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.640
part of town

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.840
where people stroll for dick

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.080

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.640
[ __ ] uh

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.839
1950s it's like you know like a salon

00:38:03.839 --> 00:38:05.040
thing where he puts it on your head and

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.160
it shoots through the race he's like

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:06.480
don't

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.640
take it the results are in the reviews

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.680
everyone's like

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.599
and it's like then why isn't they a

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:14.079
massive multi-billion dollar company

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:16.400
if it's legitimately growing hair what i

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.400
i

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.880
if you stop taking them your hair just

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.160
falls out

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.960
all at once yeah i was like i did the

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.880
math the only way i would

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.640
not i'd either i'd have to not i'd

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.920
either be depressed

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.240
and i would stop taking care of them or

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.480
i would have zero dollars

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.480
and not be able to afford the re-up so

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.320
either way it would be a terrible time

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.480
it'd be a very bad time to go bald in

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.760
like one month

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.920
yeah it doesn't freeze it doesn't like

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.760
all right wherever you started you'll go

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.000
back

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.480
to there and then start like freeze time

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.520
it's just like oh no

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.440
it's been going bald just because you

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.960
have hair but your clock has been

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.839
balding

00:38:53.839 --> 00:38:57.440

sucking blood it didn't just like

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.000

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:02.480
wait you

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.079
you lose your hair and like i think it

00:39:04.079 --> 00:39:05.520

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.040

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.040
whole world so like we sat

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.640

definitely shouldn't be grumpy but i do

00:52:16.319 --> 00:52:18.480
understand the argument of not being

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.480
ready for it

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.760
and with a girlfriend and with a

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.000
girlfriend that's also a factor

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.559

00:52:30.559 --> 00:52:34.480

whatever we say you are a country that

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.520
doesn't [ __ ] matter

00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:34.160
yeah you have a country with a ch in it

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.040

you uh they're not gonna take that guy

00:59:47.839 --> 00:59:48.720
alive like

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.160
it's a setup the whole thing's a setup

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.680
and they'll like kill him so they won't

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:52.559
whatever

00:59:52.559 --> 00:59:54.319
three minutes later they're like he's

00:59:54.319 --> 00:59:55.920
been shot in the leg he's in custody

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.520
he's in stable condition at what

00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.680
walter reed medical center yeah of

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.119
course they're going to keep him alive

01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:03.520
because

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.559
like no matter what happens he's like

01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:08.480
yeah i got an answer for it he

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.640
that guy [ __ ] rules though man i like

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.240
that guy

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.119
i'm a fan i used to love him i hated how

01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:16.480
he got lumped in with this thing when

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.480
i'm like he's just a conspiracy

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.240
that's right that's it that is important

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.240
to differentiate the right wing and

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.119
conspiracy

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:25.359
because like my friend i hate to use him

01:00:25.359 --> 01:00:26.240
as an example but

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.280
the guys that do war mode yeah they'll

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.880
say [ __ ] that i'm like you know that's

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.559
almost socialist what you're saying

01:00:32.559 --> 01:00:33.680
right

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.440
like they'll be like bezos controls

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.880
everything it's bad and it's like

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.359
oh you guys don't like monopolies like

01:00:39.359 --> 01:00:40.720
and like stuff like that

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.799
but they're all for it like they're not

01:00:42.799 --> 01:00:45.119
politically really aligned

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:47.040
oh they're just that makes sense like

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.280
it's it's almost its own lane

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.559
of like yeah it's separate

01:00:52.559 --> 01:00:54.079
yeah i don't i don't even know how to

01:00:54.079 --> 01:00:55.599
really the war thing is like that

01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:56.880
pro-war anti-war

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.799
where it's like they're all right

01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:00.160
they're just like

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.319
pro-war or they can't be anti-war is a

01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:03.920
lot of people

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.520
the guys that are like you know the

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.119
epstein guys all that they're all

01:01:07.119 --> 01:01:09.520
anti-war

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.240
they really are which is pretty good

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:12.880
i've seen

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.079
the well the guys that are like

01:01:14.079 --> 01:01:15.520
conspiracy stuff the guys that are in

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.880
conspiracy that's what i mean

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.880
they're anti-war yeah they are ant yeah

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.680
because they're always like there's a

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.520
conspiracy to get us into yemen or to

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.400
get us into this

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.319
or like they lied about bay of pigs to

01:01:24.319 --> 01:01:26.160
get whatever whatever that story is for

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.040
sure

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.599
yeah then they're right about that you

01:01:29.599 --> 01:01:30.880

separately what are you recording on

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.680
this thing oh it's doing the ambient

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.040
okay that's fine

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.720

no you're great yeah you're great but no

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:50.640
they are

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.000
they're all these like conspiracy

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.440
theorists but they have no political

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.319
alignment

01:01:54.319 --> 01:01:56.319
they're just like whatever hillary

01:01:56.319 --> 01:01:57.680
clinton's part lizard

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.000

from wherever yeah that i do they are

01:02:05.359 --> 01:02:07.839
right about the anti-war stuff

01:02:07.839 --> 01:02:09.760
that's good for the most part that's

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.280
good yeah i love

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.720

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.960
and uh she hates trump and it's now it's

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.319
like so you can stop

01:02:18.319 --> 01:02:20.319

01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:22.319
and she's like well i'm like no no just

01:02:22.319 --> 01:02:24.160
you said you don't wanna like he's gonna

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.440
let him go away

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.200
but that's how they made their lives but

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.640
anyway she said today she goes do you

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.680
hear about the vaccine

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.440
they might be starting up in like middle

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.359
december and i'm like yeah i saw pence

01:02:33.359 --> 01:02:34.319
announced that

01:02:34.319 --> 01:02:37.119
and she goes man

01:02:38.559 --> 01:02:39.760
yeah it's like it's really impressive

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.280
that the trump administration got that

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.280
vaccine out so quick

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.839
i love doing it and people like you

01:02:45.839 --> 01:02:48.160
right wing i'm like no i'm just anti-you

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.400
yeah that's really it yeah that's really

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.280
although

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.119
i have admitted this before it does i

01:02:53.119 --> 01:02:54.559
don't know i like i like the

01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:55.760
maybe because it's just where i'm from

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.599
but i like the right-wing people more

01:02:57.599 --> 01:03:01.760
as people in in our in our career

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.280
you and i who genuinely has [ __ ] with

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:05.920
my life

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.200
personally the most has been the left so

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.039
i've seen it shift and it shifted from

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:16.480
it's now political it shifted from um

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.839
dirty was the problem oh you you have to

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:21.599
rely on sex jokes

01:03:21.599 --> 01:03:23.200
and you're like no that's that was three

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.799
jokes in an hour but

01:03:24.799 --> 01:03:25.920
they always say that and now it's like

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.160
oh you have to rely on racism

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.160
and you're like no so the sex jokes

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.160
things were more like the christians

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.359
and they were a little more right wing

01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:35.359
but it wasn't like

01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:36.640
we need to get rid of you they were just

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.880
like yeah that's all that's all new

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.680
yeah so personally i've that's the

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.319
anyway

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:43.440
i don't want to get too serious i

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.039
[ __ ] hate them and i think a lot of

01:03:45.039 --> 01:03:45.599
them

01:03:45.599 --> 01:03:47.520
if like if they just ended like

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.960
political strife like if

01:10:50.719 --> 01:10:53.840
if you're silent about black

01:10:57.199 --> 01:10:59.280
because i peop never not voting is

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.199
voting for the other side i'm like

01:11:01.199 --> 01:11:04.560
that's so [ __ ] pompous

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.600
yeah it's it's been but you know i'm

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.120
again i'm very easily

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.840
i can get propaganda it's pretty easy so

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.920
i can get tricked into like

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.080
it was it was tough you know i didn't

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.600
put up a black square

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.719
yeah that's what i was about to ask you

01:11:18.719 --> 01:11:21.040
what was it

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.640
but there was pressure and there was

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.239
like

01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:26.080
genuine like and then like i was just at

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.840
my parents house i wasn't doing anything

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.960
i was just me too

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.080
i was like dude am i should i sit

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.560
and then i was like you know you have

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.320
like a moment of clarity like what the

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.159
[ __ ] are you talking about like what are

01:11:38.159 --> 01:11:41.840
you doing

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.239
instead of [ __ ] make signifying that

01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:47.679
i'm okay and i love

01:11:47.679 --> 01:11:49.199
all the actors who posted that and then

01:11:49.199 --> 01:11:50.800
people go hey uh

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.000
that reminds me let me look into your

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.719
past real quick oh you got a bunch of

01:11:54.719 --> 01:11:56.400
questionable [ __ ] you're like

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.320
that was one i was like nah you're not

01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.920
gonna i'm not gonna be

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.679
in the game i'm gonna be out of it and

01:12:01.679 --> 01:12:02.960
it's such a lame

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.920
obvious way to show that you don't hate

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.520
black people i'm like i i

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.920
i don't know ask an old opener or

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.360
something yeah that was just

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.320
there was total social pressure that

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.440
almost everybody

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.719
we know caved to some way or another

01:12:18.719 --> 01:12:20.880
and then it's like and i get it i'm not

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.800
criticizing really because it it could

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.600
happen

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.679
i'm susceptible to being a [ __ ] at any

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:27.280
moment but

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.719
but you should be over the criticism

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:31.120
when it does happen yeah like me buying

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:31.440
hair

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:36.080
me buying hair pills [ __ ] i admit i

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.800
tried to pretend i was blacked out

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.320
i wasn't you're like i had one truly uh

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.640
but uh yeah i was close i remember that

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.679
and then you know what you know what

01:12:45.679 --> 01:12:46.320
really

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.560
[ __ ] me up on that was like three

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.080
weeks after all that

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.440
i you know i hate to say like george

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.960
floyd but it was like three or four

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.480
weeks it was like a month

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.800
after george floyd and there was an nba

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.480
commercial

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.360
where it was like lebron james it was

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.960
like for the playoffs it was like lebron

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.560
james was like dunking

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.159
it was like all this cool [ __ ] and it

01:13:06.159 --> 01:13:07.760
was like we're gonna rise up against

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.719
racism

01:13:08.719 --> 01:13:10.880
i was like i just remember being like oh

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.840
yeah

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.440
i forgot about that like i forgot we

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.120
were all i forgot we were rising up

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.080
against races

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.880
like i was like and i did it just it was

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:19.280
very

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.120
you know it just was funny that like

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.280
corporations are going to be

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:25.199
slightly behind when it comes to the

01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:26.640
commercials they put out and we're still

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.679
going to be getting like

01:13:27.679 --> 01:13:29.840
black lives matter nhl commercials and

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.280
like

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.960
in next yeah they got mad at the nhl

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.719
because because nba and baseball took a

01:13:34.719 --> 01:13:36.320
day off after somebody got killed and

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.320
angel was like yeah we're not gonna take

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.159
off work like how dare you he's like how

01:13:40.159 --> 01:13:42.080
dare our whole corporation not take off

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:42.719
like

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:46.320
go talk to ge they're not taking off

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.960
why also we have like three blacks yeah

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.320
we have pk subban

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.159
and we've been making them talk every

01:13:52.159 --> 01:13:53.840
day

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.480
it's uncomfortable dude they really said

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.760
like the nba when they're like maybe we

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.719
shouldn't come back because maybe it'll

01:13:58.719 --> 01:13:59.360
distract

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.400
from this cause and

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.800
it did cool lebron's playing

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.840
[ __ ] all of us it really did

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.000
of course it did dude remember podcast

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.840
lebron said hey the lakers are walking

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.239
out

01:14:14.239 --> 01:14:16.320
and then everyone's like uh good luck

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.600
with that we're gonna keep playing

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.280
giannis and everything we're like yeah

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.800
he's like oh no no we'll keep playing no

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.560
we'll keep playing too we'll get there

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.800
[ __ ] [ __ ] yeah the same people the

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.480
same people that were like no china is

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.840
pretty cool

01:14:30.239 --> 01:14:31.840
dude i read this article on like how we

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.760
use word fascism way too much

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.360
and uh they're like you call trump a

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.960
fascist because he has like

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.960
fascist like ideas i don't really fully

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.239
understand it but then like

01:14:40.239 --> 01:14:43.520
he hates china and biden is like we

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.040
should do business with china

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.640
and china is a fascist regime yeah

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.440
china is a authoritarian and so you've

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.520
used this word up so much on a guy who

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.000
opposes the actual thing you're talking

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:56.640
about

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.800
yeah it's like the uh it's like the

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.400
metoo movement

go move left pick right

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.920
they might be faster than you but juking

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.040

01:24:30.639 --> 01:24:32.400

so my my new york club experience hasn't

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.440
been that

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.960
extensive because i like

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:58.800
was relative i was new and then i got

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.719

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.239
the laugh factory owner they used to do

01:25:16.239 --> 01:25:17.280
the open mics

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.639

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:25.440
like

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.600
a college professor telling second

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.880

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:05.760
that hap when those

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.360
when tv started moving away when

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.199
lettermen were tired and like

01:27:09.199 --> 01:27:10.880
i think a lot of people were like they

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.480
built their acts for

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.920
exactly that and then because it was

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.920
never i was [ __ ]

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.400

can't wait for everybody to get that

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.920

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.920
lot of things by the way you're also not

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.840
i just apply it to everything

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:52.320
yeah the the late night thing it's very

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.679
funny that even i remember

01:27:53.679 --> 01:27:55.199

[ __ ] or being impressed by that and i

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.120
was like

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.719

01:28:09.199 --> 01:28:10.800
when he goes and gets a real job he can

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.639
be like i did letterman

01:28:12.639 --> 01:28:14.719

01:30:40.639 --> 01:30:43.199
it for people yeah it's not they don't

01:30:43.199 --> 01:30:44.560
that's you want to talk about a group

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:46.159
that really doesn't care i mean [ __ ]

01:30:46.159 --> 01:30:48.400
club owners talk about the [ __ ]

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.480
industry and [ __ ] writer's rooms and

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:52.719
all that [ __ ] of just like

01:30:52.719 --> 01:30:54.880
resentful [ __ ] that wanted to

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.960
be writers and wanted to be

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:59.920

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:00.800
at you they have

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.320
to come up with a reason why why they're

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:04.159
not and you are i

01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:06.320
think that was because i i just this is

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.800
all new like literally this is year two

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.000
of all this for me

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.840
so the first year was really cool i got

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.199
like jfl

01:31:13.199 --> 01:31:15.440
up next with comedy central snl that was

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.600
cool as [ __ ] at first for like a month

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.239
and then yeah that's quick it was all

01:31:20.239 --> 01:31:22.080
this year it was right

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.560
and then immediately like snl was like

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:25.520
that's like that should've been four

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.639
years later

01:31:26.639 --> 01:31:28.560
yeah that was right away they they saw

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.320
me they were like this guy is

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.000
good and then but everybody was

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.600
then i started to realize everybody like

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.040
all the agents all the writers all the

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.880
producers on shows and [ __ ]

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.639
i became friends with them on instagram

01:31:40.639 --> 01:31:42.159
so we were on instagram and i realized

01:31:42.159 --> 01:31:44.560
they wanted to be cool

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:47.920
like they were all like

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.520

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.639
i don't know it was weird to see it was

01:31:56.639 --> 01:31:57.760

01:32:33.679 --> 01:32:35.360
they want people that are like the

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.199
actual gatekeepers in this industry

01:32:37.199 --> 01:32:40.880
[ __ ] stink dude as as corny as the

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:41.840
comedians are

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:44.880
as people almost not all of them

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.520
obviously i like comedians for the most

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.880
part

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.800
i'm lying i like i like about ten

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.840
percent i hate

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.840
it

01:32:58.159 --> 01:33:00.880
they really are [ __ ] punks they

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:02.000
really i don't know what happened to my

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:02.480
industry

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.159
my colleagues used to be so cool we used

01:33:04.159 --> 01:33:05.679
to be outsiders

01:33:05.679 --> 01:33:07.360
and then they got popular and they

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.199
started trying to hold on to it

01:33:09.199 --> 01:33:10.560
i've had people sell me out and their

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:12.239
first thing was like you might he could

01:33:12.239 --> 01:33:14.000
lose sponsors for this and i'm like

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
that's what you're thinking about you

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.040
[ __ ]

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:20.960
wow oh my god

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:23.120
what happened to comics what the [ __ ]

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:25.120
happened to comics

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:26.960
i mean i was never that that's the thing

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:28.639
you and i have had this conversation

01:33:28.639 --> 01:33:30.239
before because i started

01:33:30.239 --> 01:33:33.440
like late enough that like when 2016 has

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.120
so when trump got elected that's when

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:37.840
[ __ ] really turned for me i started

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:39.440
probably in like 2010

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:41.440
i'm probably in year 10 of me doing an

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.040
open mic for the first time

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:46.400
okay and you're ahead of schedule

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.320
i am yeah i mean i gotta snl i'm

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:50.639
literally ahead of every single schedule

01:33:50.639 --> 01:33:53.600
yeah that's just you know obviously it

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:54.239
backfired

01:33:54.239 --> 01:33:56.239
quite a bit but i'm saying statistically

01:33:56.239 --> 01:33:58.159
i'm doing all right

01:33:58.159 --> 01:34:01.440
not now rooms 10 years in that's pretty

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.840
good

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:06.239
yeah but i i only experienced like cool

01:34:06.239 --> 01:34:06.800
comedy

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.400
and obviously i was starting an open

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.480
like scene so it was fun

01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:13.440
but like 2015 or 16 when it switched

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.520
when everybody got political

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.280
[ __ ] really sucked like all of a sudden

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.120
everything kind of sucked

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.719
i moved to new york for one year [ __ ]

01:34:20.719 --> 01:34:22.800
was cool but that was just because i was

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.679
getting things and everybody was nice

01:34:25.679 --> 01:34:26.000
and

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.679
i don't know i don't know i comedy's

01:34:27.679 --> 01:34:29.040
always kind of been gay

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.360
for me like everybody i've always been

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.440
around has kind of been gay for the last

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.520
five years so at least half my and that

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.600
was all during my actual career

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.880
you know what i mean right right yeah

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.080
when you weren't you know michael you

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:41.679
were yeah

01:34:41.679 --> 01:34:43.840
starting starting to do some stupid

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.440
comments yeah

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.360
it's always been yeah it's always been

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.440
when you see like the minority of people

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:52.080
taking what i say is just the right side

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:53.280
which is like

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:55.920
i don't care what they said i'm not

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.040
gonna weigh i don't know if it's funny

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:57.600
or not

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.920
i'm just saying if the guy was going for

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.080
a laugh then that's all i got to know

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:05.360
yeah and you hear com any comic

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.800
not take that side you're like what and

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:09.199
then you hear most comics not take that

01:35:09.199 --> 01:35:11.520
side and you're like what the [ __ ]

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.560
yeah i mean i saw andrew shulls

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.520
in a black radio station go you guys

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:19.600
don't get it he's going for a laugh

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:22.239
and i'm like why is this voice the

01:35:22.239 --> 01:35:23.520
minority

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:27.040
and not the the most obvious take

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.600
i i don't i don't know what we did i

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:30.719
don't know what we did

01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:32.719
damn good jobs that's sick good for

01:35:32.719 --> 01:35:33.920
schultz exactly

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:36.080
[ __ ] yeah that took some balls dude that

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.159
took some holidays

01:35:38.159 --> 01:35:40.000
yeah in that world for sure but it's

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.480
like it it should just be like

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.679
yeah of course you're going to say

01:35:43.679 --> 01:35:46.719
unfortunately yeah

01:35:46.719 --> 01:35:48.320
yeah comics [ __ ] it i don't know that's

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.840
kind of surprising yeah there's there's

01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:52.719
been so many that i was just like

01:35:52.719 --> 01:35:54.320
and the funny the real funny thing is

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.000
how hypocritical it is when they throw

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.760
you under the bus just like it's like yo

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.719
you're talking [ __ ] all right all right

01:36:00.719 --> 01:36:02.000
eddie

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.520
usually comes from a place of insecurity

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:05.520
it's usually people that aren't funny

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:07.520
i've never heard a funny person do that

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:08.880
for the most part

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:11.199
and go yeah yeah yeah all right i'll say

01:36:11.199 --> 01:36:12.560
this i've never heard a person that's

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:12.880
still

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:16.320
funny do any of that i have here

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.159
there but it's usually like people who

01:36:18.159 --> 01:36:19.679
already hated me

01:36:19.679 --> 01:36:21.199
and so they're like waiting for the

01:36:21.199 --> 01:36:22.800
chance but even then it's still you

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.400
should go

01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.560
i'm gonna have to [ __ ] this guy but no

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.080
no no you guys can't do it for this

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:29.280
reason

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:31.840
that's how i felt about uh a lot of the

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.600
la guys that got in trouble i was like

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.199
i don't know them i don't give a [ __ ]

01:36:35.199 --> 01:36:37.920
[ __ ] them i personally don't give a [ __ ]

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:40.080
but

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:42.960
take it easy i'm like what do you mean

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:43.440
um

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.199
what do you mean take it easy i know

01:36:45.199 --> 01:36:47.040
what you mean l.a guys

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:50.400
like uh i don't know callan

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:52.000
yeah i don't know dalia i don't know

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.400
them but like you can't be

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:57.760
la times front page accusation people

01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:00.080
that's a little much am i off subject i

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.280
had a couple of dreams no no

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.320
yeah it's okay what do you mean you

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:03.920
can't be you mean they're accusing or

01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:05.760
they're being accused

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.920
you can't like that's [ __ ] up to be

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.760
because these days you're guilty

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.679
so i'm saying if you got a front page

01:37:11.679 --> 01:37:13.119
article

01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:17.600
with an accusation you're guilty

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.280
you're just everybody's mind you're just

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:21.760
guilty and that's crazy that's like

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.679
it's crazy that's like a thing we should

01:37:23.679 --> 01:37:26.239
watch out for

01:37:26.239 --> 01:37:28.800
especially like with dalia he wasn't

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:30.239
being accused of anything

01:37:30.239 --> 01:37:32.400
and i know like i had a former someone i

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.760
used to work with and this isn't the

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:34.000
reason

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.080
we don't work together but like she's a

01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:37.600
big feminist and she's like

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:38.719
hey i don't even think he did anything

01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:39.840
wrong i'm like well then you got to open

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:40.719
your mouth

01:37:40.719 --> 01:37:41.920
yeah and say i don't think he did

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.440
anything wrong it's like ah no i'm like

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:44.159
well then

01:37:44.159 --> 01:37:46.880
you're just [ __ ] over feminists

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.320
you're saying we can't go against our

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.840
own even when we're wrong that's like

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.440

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:53.600

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:55.600
did

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:56.880
and then immediately netflix is like

01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.880

01:38:07.679 --> 01:38:08.719

because that was the only one i watched

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.040

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.520
them and then a bunch of other people

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.480
that

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.760
he's never even met whatever

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:35.360
but yeah we're yeah we're getting a

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.360
little rowdy this is good

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:42.080
yeah it's just appearing [ __ ] on [ __ ]

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.199

01:38:45.199 --> 01:38:47.280

yeah i didn't think you did so here's

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:50.480
what i like about it

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:52.000
more than anything because i do love

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.679
weed

01:38:53.679 --> 01:38:55.600
the bragging about something that's not

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:56.880
even illegal in

01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:59.440
honestly most countries anymore and

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:00.719
you're still acting like a [ __ ]

01:39:00.719 --> 01:39:02.400
outlaw

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.080
yeah i i i just got into coke

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:08.159
i think that deserves a little more

01:39:08.159 --> 01:39:10.159
respect

01:39:10.159 --> 01:39:12.239
dude i think making a comeback in terms

01:39:12.239 --> 01:39:13.440
of how cool it is they're

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.280
awful group and i've gotten to fights

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.960
with derose about this they're an awful

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:18.400
group he handles it well

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:21.360
but like it they're too much but like

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.480
it's cool again

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:25.600
coke is good yeah no doubt about that

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:28.880
no dude

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.119
you know what coke heads never do wear

01:39:31.119 --> 01:39:32.560
clothes with coke

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:35.119
designs on it true they should turn into

01:39:35.119 --> 01:39:36.560
that they should go more like

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:40.080
a coconut total identity as coke

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.880
oh my god the weed fashion is so [ __ ]

01:42:18.719 --> 01:42:20.320
probably do that you you've

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.239

01:42:22.239 --> 01:42:23.440
anybody that talks [ __ ] on you

01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:25.040
especially publicly

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:27.040
it's very fun to just go watch their

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.360
special and just be like

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:32.159

they stink dude

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:42.080
it's like that's that's why that's why

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.520
you would take that that's why you would

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:44.800
take the stance of

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.880
well that was just racist how dare you

01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:48.000
it's like because

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.080
you're not very good and so you couldn't

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:51.040
see

01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:52.719
a second layer to it or you couldn't be

01:42:52.719 --> 01:42:54.320
like what's this technique what's he

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:55.760
going for here

01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.159
it's instead you're just saying like the

01:42:58.159 --> 01:42:59.440
huffington post's

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:03.199
headline and agreeing with it

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:06.000
outsiders you [ __ ] dorks every

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.440
comedian listen up

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:10.960
we're outsiders [ __ ] unless snl

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:14.400
offers you and then take it and then be

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:15.920
a rich insider

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:18.000
i mean do it but then like at least che

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.600
does it well where he's like he still

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:20.880
pokes the bear

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:22.400
he's constantly on there at least he

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.719
used to be on facebook

01:43:24.719 --> 01:43:28.560
he's like yeah and they're just like

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:30.239
yeah i'm i was always like proud of him

01:43:30.239 --> 01:43:32.239
i was like hey not [ __ ] completely be

01:43:32.239 --> 01:43:34.000
that that thing they want you to be

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.400
chase is real as he can be for sure yeah

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.679
he is literally

01:43:37.679 --> 01:43:40.880
past the line of what he should be doing

01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:44.080
yeah yeah that's good dude um as your

01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:44.880
friend like

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:47.119
take that down yeah but like i mean i

01:43:47.119 --> 01:43:48.719
agree with you it's hilarious but like

01:43:48.719 --> 01:43:50.320
they're not gonna see it that way they

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:51.679
just won't come after him it's kind of

01:43:51.679 --> 01:43:53.040
hilarious

01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:56.719
why do you think that because he's like

01:43:56.719 --> 01:43:58.480
under six feet tall they have a problem

01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:01.440
with short people yeah

01:44:02.719 --> 01:44:05.440
um i mean i actually think those people

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:06.159
have like

01:44:06.159 --> 01:44:07.760
not a bigger responsibility but they're

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.840
more important comedy voices

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:12.719
i hate saying [ __ ] like that but like so

01:44:12.719 --> 01:44:14.320
like

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.159
when nick cannon got fired for [ __ ]

01:44:16.159 --> 01:44:17.360

01:44:33.119 --> 01:44:36.400
personal opinion judging a juggler

pretty tight

01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:17.040

01:45:35.199 --> 01:45:36.320
daring for they want to hear what you

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.920

01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:41.600

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:44.239
nobody's better they're out there in the

01:45:44.239 --> 01:45:45.679
corners in new york just like

01:45:45.679 --> 01:45:49.119
talking in america the funniest trump

01:45:49.119 --> 01:45:51.199
trump and black israelites should go on

01:45:51.199 --> 01:45:52.800
tour

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.960
easily it would be the great it'd be the

01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:57.520
true kings of comedy

01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.840
trump black israelites and a couple like

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:01.520
alex jones supporters

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.360
they can't go after them they can't go

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:04.639
after them because of the black

01:46:04.639 --> 01:46:07.440
it gives them a shield it really does

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:08.880
dude they got mad at me

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:11.440
for calling a guy who admitted to having

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:13.280
raped someone a rapist

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:15.840
more recently than brian cowan was

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.760
accused of and denies it

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:19.920
like that was five years earlier and

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:20.800
people like no

01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:22.800
he's redeemed himself but that guy sucks

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:25.040
i'm like what are you guys talking about

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.719
what's the what's the key difference

01:46:26.719 --> 01:46:28.480
here yeah

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.159
yeah wow wait that was something i was

01:46:32.159 --> 01:46:34.000
gonna say before but i forgot [ __ ]

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.040
what we were talking about

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.280
i don't know we're [ __ ] up dude this

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:40.159
is probably a mistake

01:46:43.119 --> 01:46:46.080
yeah it's a freeing you ever hear norman

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.360
i don't talk about losing all his money

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.080
in in uh

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.560
in gambling yeah he goes like it's uh

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.280
you're clean

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.800
it's a clean feeling you've lost all

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.800
your money you got to start from scratch

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:56.320
i feel like every time i get in super

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.000
trouble it's just like

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.199
for a little bit like oh [ __ ] [ __ ]

01:46:59.199 --> 01:47:00.639
there's a pit in your stomach and stuff

01:47:00.639 --> 01:47:02.320
and then after he's like

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:05.119
well now you guys are powerless i can't

01:47:05.119 --> 01:47:05.600
do

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.840
whatever i want it's been nice i'm

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:08.880
finally uh

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:12.560
i'm finally hitting that stride it took

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:14.960
longer than i thought it would but i

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:16.239
it's definitely the last

01:47:16.239 --> 01:47:19.040
the last couple months i've just been

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.400
fully like this is actually

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:23.679
pretty cool for a while

01:47:23.679 --> 01:47:26.000
i talked to somebody at netflix was

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.280
asking me about you how you're doing and

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.000
it was like

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.679
they were concerned man i told you this

01:47:29.679 --> 01:47:30.719
or not they're concerned that this

01:47:30.719 --> 01:47:31.840
happens a lot where

01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:33.600
you see somebody taking an attack and

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.600
they go their whole identity is going

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:37.040
back against the attacks sure

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.320
which that shouldn't be because they

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:39.440
didn't care about the attack it just

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.719
came at them yeah bunch of people didn't

01:47:40.719 --> 01:47:41.520
know them

01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:42.719
so why are you responding to people who

01:47:42.719 --> 01:47:43.840
were never going to come see a show and

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:45.760
never were

01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.239
but i was like nah his first like joke

01:47:48.239 --> 01:47:49.760
joke i remember coming back is

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:50.800
talking about how funny it would be if

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.960
trump got assassinated and they're like

01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:54.239
and then like i don't know he's just

01:47:54.239 --> 01:47:56.159
like still doing like kind of both side

01:47:56.159 --> 01:47:56.560
stuff

01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:57.840
he's kind of he hasn't really done

01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:00.400
anything new

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:04.960
you were more like yeah your exact

01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:08.320
which hurts me more yeah like yeah he's

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:10.159
got a routine dude he's working cruise

01:48:10.159 --> 01:48:11.520
ships he ain't gonna change it just

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:13.360
because of this

01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:14.960
yeah that that bothered the [ __ ] out of

01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:16.560
me that bothered the [ __ ] out of me

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.080
because the same people

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:20.239

you don't do impressions

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:31.679

01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.239
comic not since like

01:52:46.239 --> 01:52:48.000

01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:54.080
mainstream guy who's just dirty and

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.480
a normal club comic like this is cool

01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:58.639
and then when it went the other way

01:52:58.639 --> 01:53:00.159

01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:26.159
i was about to be like no white guys

01:58:26.159 --> 01:58:28.239
doing stand up they're taking the real

01:58:28.239 --> 01:58:29.040
red like i

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:32.960
like i had to like slow down

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:36.400
i ended up saying it you said it but you

01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:38.320
uh whatever i said i made fun of it i

01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.520
knew it was wrong i knew it was

01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:42.080
inappropriate to say something like that

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:44.159
i i do think what you said like it takes

01:58:44.159 --> 01:58:45.360
a while and then you're like coming into

01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:46.639
your own finally we're like i guess i

01:58:46.639 --> 01:58:48.000
just don't care anymore

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.119
it does take a while you don't want to

01:58:49.119 --> 01:58:50.560
admit it i didn't want to admit it was

01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:53.520
like [ __ ] this is [ __ ] bothering me

01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:55.920
it's like yeah i go back to just like

01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:57.440
being offensive for fun

01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:00.840
that's what it was supposed to be yeah i

01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:02.639
mean yeah i always

01:59:02.639 --> 01:59:05.760
i always just yeah i mean eventually you

01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:08.880
move past it where it's like

01:59:09.679 --> 01:59:11.040
it's not like you're trying to hold on

01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:14.159
to anything but it's like

01:59:14.639 --> 01:59:16.000
yeah i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.920
saying it's it

01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:19.119
eventually it gets to the point where

01:59:19.119 --> 01:59:20.400
you're like oh yeah who cares it's like

01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:20.960
a breakup

01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:23.119
it's like any breakup where it's like

01:59:23.119 --> 01:59:25.760
for like three months you're like

01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:28.560
yeah it's like a breakup now especially

01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:29.840
when you're like a junior in high school

01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:31.040
and you look back on her now and you're

01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:31.360
like

01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:32.960
oh i don't have anything else about that

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:34.960
name what yeah and then you get a little

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:36.880
then you get some [ __ ] and you're like

01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:39.040
oh [ __ ] never mind

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:41.920
dude i had a bad day when i was like

01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:44.000
patreon is [ __ ]

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.280
you're getting a lot of pictures you get

01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:47.040
some patreon you're just like

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.199
oh never mind you just get ahead from

01:59:49.199 --> 01:59:50.960
patreon and you're like dude you don't

01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:52.400
care about justify

01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:54.239
that night and i was like you're getting

01:59:54.239 --> 01:59:55.520
enough money where you don't have to do

01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:56.639
ads i'm like

01:59:56.639 --> 01:59:59.360
that is i i that's all i would want if

01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:00.880
my patreon got big enough where i don't

02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:02.239
have to do ads

02:00:02.239 --> 02:00:04.719
i could be like i'm free well we

02:00:04.719 --> 02:00:06.800
probably should be doing ads

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:09.920
no no no no i talked to this war

02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:11.440
reporter and he's like he won't take

02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:13.360
ad money because he's so afraid of them

02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:15.679
going like we prefer you not do a thing

02:00:15.679 --> 02:00:17.040

02:00:23.679 --> 02:00:26.000
could report on yemen instead

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
but it would be outside my own this

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.679

02:02:56.719 --> 02:03:00.239

recognize how great it is why it's

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:14.880
impossible to recognize while you're

02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:16.320
getting canceled

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:18.000
the opportunity you have to say

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.400
something incredibly funny

02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:22.639
yeah you know what i envy at certain

02:03:22.639 --> 02:03:24.239

i'm not cancelled you're cancelled i'm

02:03:25.599 --> 02:03:25.920
like

02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:27.840
i wish i would have handled it that way

02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:29.119
that would have been a great way just

02:03:29.119 --> 02:03:31.440
fire back like [ __ ] off

02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:33.119
well i could have done that i couldn't

02:03:33.119 --> 02:03:34.960
have like tweeted like no you guys are

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:37.040
fired from snl

02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:39.199
you could have been hilarious you're

02:03:39.199 --> 02:03:40.560
still trying to hold on to the idea that

02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:42.880
you maybe you could be on there

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:45.040
so then it's like i can't fully go where

02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:46.800
i want because i'm not done yet

02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:47.920
and then they're like hey man you gotta

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:49.199
handle this with class because otherwise

02:03:49.199 --> 02:03:50.480
you'll be done for real for real and

02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:52.079
you're like

02:03:52.079 --> 02:03:53.520
it takes someone like diaz he's like

02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:55.760
i've already i've already done

02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:57.920
acting and i'm done with it yeah you

02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:59.440

02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:02.079
it's like yeah i'm in this world i saw

02:04:02.079 --> 02:04:02.639
burr

02:04:02.639 --> 02:04:05.119
at oddball he was doing that like

02:04:05.119 --> 02:04:06.800
conversation with the crowd without them

02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:08.719
talking you know like uh yeah

02:04:08.719 --> 02:04:10.079
does the same thing but gavin has a

02:04:10.079 --> 02:04:11.840
weird voice and he was like he burst

02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:13.040
said something he was offensive and he

02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:13.360
goes

02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:14.880
you should be fired and he goes fired

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.800
from what i don't have a job

02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:18.960
people pay to come see me and then they

02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:20.560
they see me

02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:23.119
yeah they're fired as long as i can do

02:04:23.119 --> 02:04:24.639
stand up yeah that [ __ ] rules

02:04:24.639 --> 02:04:27.840
stand up rules yeah uh yeah and now

02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:29.119
you know you're just gonna have to do

02:04:29.119 --> 02:04:32.480
your own specials and that's cool

02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:33.520
that's the way it's headed down here

02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:35.280
like a difference of like 40 grand right

02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:35.760
now

02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:38.800
for my you know from your life well no

02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:39.599
i'm saying like

02:04:39.599 --> 02:04:42.239
if i youtubed my first special verse got

02:04:42.239 --> 02:04:43.119
like

02:04:43.119 --> 02:04:46.000
at first special on something of it you

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.040
know

02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:49.119
like if i got a comedy central half hour

02:04:49.119 --> 02:04:50.560
versus they're done

02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:52.159
youtube an option anymore sure they are

02:04:52.159 --> 02:04:53.679
dead but say they were still alive and

02:04:53.679 --> 02:04:54.639
in their prime

02:04:54.639 --> 02:04:56.159
a comedy central half hour would have

02:04:56.159 --> 02:04:58.719
got me how much money

02:04:58.719 --> 02:05:01.119
dude i'm already it's already so forget

02:05:01.119 --> 02:05:01.840
that

02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:05.119
if you do a netflix

02:05:05.199 --> 02:05:09.199
15 on something or just release your own

02:05:09.199 --> 02:05:11.199
thing on your own youtube

02:05:11.199 --> 02:05:14.239
i don't one it'll be better for your

02:05:14.239 --> 02:05:16.800
numbers on youtube so money-wise you'll

02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:18.079
bring in more

02:05:18.079 --> 02:05:21.520
yeah off that even an hour and two

02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:24.480
literally i think more people could see

02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:25.040
it

02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:27.199
for sure you'll probably get like two

02:05:27.199 --> 02:05:28.960
million people saying an hour to maybe

02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:30.880
three as an unknown on on netflix i

02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:31.840
don't know and you mean

02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:33.119
you know what i mean like not like

02:05:33.119 --> 02:05:35.840
famous

02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:37.679

02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:33.280
comics stand

02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:35.440
by you because they're like no you're

02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:36.960
not a bad person be like no but you are

02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:38.960
a bad person like no [ __ ] you now i know

02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:39.920
exactly what you're talking about it's

02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:41.199
just [ __ ] [ __ ]

02:07:41.199 --> 02:07:43.840
yeah it's [ __ ] [ __ ] it's it's

02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:45.520
terrible behavior but here's the deal

02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:47.360
the reason you don't like people's names

02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:48.639
is because you know you might be sending

02:07:48.639 --> 02:07:49.520
someone after them

02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:51.760
and they don't deserve that for sure so

02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:53.040
it's like

02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:57.040
dude i i called every single person

02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:58.800
who went after me hard who has now

02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:00.239
caught their own scandal

02:08:00.239 --> 02:08:01.920
how you doing man you okay i know this

02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:03.840
can be terrible i know it's even worse

02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:04.480
when your

02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:05.760
friends and colleagues turn against you

02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:07.520
and so i'm just checking up on

02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:09.920
and not one of them was like hey dude

02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:11.520
i'm sorry i did that to you

02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:12.960
they're all they all go hey thanks

02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:14.079
that's really nice you were checking up

02:08:14.079 --> 02:08:15.199
on me and you're like

02:08:15.199 --> 02:08:16.800
you can't relate this to yourself at all

02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:18.719
huh you don't see anything you did wrong

02:08:18.719 --> 02:08:20.800
yeah

02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:22.639
[ __ ] them all i'll just kill them with

02:08:22.639 --> 02:08:24.639
kindness that's all you can do

02:08:24.639 --> 02:08:27.520
yeah yeah because again if you name them

02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:28.719
then they're going to get that you're

02:08:28.719 --> 02:08:29.599
doing the same thing

02:08:29.599 --> 02:08:33.040

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.840
face which you have to people which is

02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:47.920
like that's the way you should do it

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:49.520
you gotta say to their face if you see

02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:51.920

it wasn't okay

02:09:10.079 --> 02:09:11.679
we could move past it but like that was

02:09:11.679 --> 02:09:13.040
[ __ ] wrong shouldn't have done that

02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:14.400
[ __ ]

02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:15.599

world and it was like oh yeah yeah

02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:46.480
there's plenty of normal people who like

02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:47.920
[ __ ] support you

02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:49.520
well none of them that watch legion of

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:51.360
skanks are normal

02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:53.119
that's an excellent point so don't

02:09:53.119 --> 02:09:54.719
that's an excellent point don't look for

02:09:54.719 --> 02:09:57.679
normal people yeah but you know comedy

02:09:57.679 --> 02:09:58.239
fans

02:09:58.239 --> 02:10:00.400
sure people that yeah that care about

02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.079
comedy yeah did you see we'll get back

02:10:02.079 --> 02:10:03.280
into [ __ ] on [ __ ] in a second

02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:05.280
did you see when you did get on stage

02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:06.800
because people must have been aware of

02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:07.760
it a little bit because

02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:09.920
people go to comedy clubs are aware of

02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:10.800
the yes

02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:12.719
you can make a joke about someone being

02:10:12.719 --> 02:10:14.000
accused of sexual

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.079
improprieties in the comedy world to a

02:10:16.079 --> 02:10:17.599
comedy club-going audience

02:10:17.599 --> 02:10:19.840
you might not be able to do it in you

02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:20.719
know the

02:10:20.719 --> 02:10:22.560
stand-up live in phoenix but in new york

02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:24.480
they're sort of comedy savvy

02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:27.920
did you feel supported or unsupported or

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:29.040
a mixture or whatever

02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:32.079
by those audiences i started coming back

02:10:32.079 --> 02:10:35.679
never once felt unsupported outside of

02:10:35.679 --> 02:10:36.560
my own head

02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:38.000
like every once in a while i'd see

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.400
people whisper

02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:42.239
to each other they must be yeah any

02:10:42.239 --> 02:10:43.840
conversation which actually a lot of

02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:45.119
times at first

02:10:45.119 --> 02:10:47.520
it was definitely like yo that's that

02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:49.119
that's that [ __ ] guy

02:10:49.119 --> 02:10:52.000
like yeah a bunch of times cause people

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:52.880
would

02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:54.400
a lot of times hosts would [ __ ] with me

02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:55.760
and be like this guy you may have seen

02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:56.800
him like

02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:58.960
on cnn like something like that so that

02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:00.639
people in the people in the crowd would

02:11:00.639 --> 02:11:01.920
be like

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:03.760
who and then i could see some

02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:05.599
conversations uh but

02:11:05.599 --> 02:11:08.400
no everybody even if they're like super

02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:10.800
liberals or whatever

02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:12.560
not that that's like who i'm against but

02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:14.400
like no no but then they're the type who

02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:15.679
kind of went against you but it wasn't

02:11:15.679 --> 02:11:18.800
the comedy club liberals

02:11:19.119 --> 02:11:21.760
i never had a bad set due to that

02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:23.040
everybody was always

02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:24.960
in fact once you joke about it or start

02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:27.040
doing well people are just instantly

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:28.320
like

02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:31.360
what were we mad at i just got like

02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:34.000
and i talked to some friends that were

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.760
going through like minor

02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:37.920
little cancellation like a tweet about

02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:39.679
them went kind of bad

02:11:39.679 --> 02:11:42.239
yeah and it was like yo for a while

02:11:42.239 --> 02:11:43.840
you're going to be in your own head that

02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:45.360
everybody in the audience is thinking

02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:46.239
about it

02:11:46.239 --> 02:11:49.280
no one cares no one gives a [ __ ]

02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:51.520
themselves you care about this more than

02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:53.840
anybody on earth

02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:56.239
and nobody's even thinking about it

02:11:56.239 --> 02:11:57.599
you'll be all right like just

02:11:57.599 --> 02:12:00.000
do stand up dude i didn't get to go up

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:00.880
for a day or two

02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:03.840
because like uh new york comedy club had

02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:05.199
i had a set like

02:12:05.199 --> 02:12:07.199
a day or two later i think nothing that

02:12:07.199 --> 02:12:08.800
day and then the next day new york comic

02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:10.079
con with zero audience so they're like

[ __ ] articles and huffpo and [ __ ]

02:27:40.399 --> 02:27:40.880
about

02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:42.319
about being a karen i see the people

02:27:42.319 --> 02:27:44.000
calling uh the cops on on

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:44.960

02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:56.479
problem and the other part of me goes

02:27:56.479 --> 02:27:56.960
like

02:27:56.960 --> 02:27:59.280
you're not doing it right you got to do

02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:00.720
it right

02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:02.560
you're not playing by the rules and guys

02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:04.319
i i see both sides of it

02:28:04.319 --> 02:28:08.080
the world needs a karen once in a while

02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:09.920
when i see some people [ __ ] up

02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:11.280
playing loud music

02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:13.040
in a park or something is bothering

02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:14.560
everybody i'm not going to go up there

02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:16.880
and talk to him

02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:20.560

yeah you're perfect you go do it for me

02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:26.800
your current you got to use them for

02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:28.319
good it's not the fact they

02:28:28.319 --> 02:28:30.080
tattletail is the problem it's they do

02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:32.399
it at the wrong time

02:28:32.399 --> 02:28:36.240
that's the issue start [ __ ] on all

02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:37.840
the zodiac signs

02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:40.080
it's always so funny yes thank you

02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:42.080
finally i wish i saw your name benko

02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:43.600
beats or something like that

02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:46.560
yeah dude [ __ ] anyone who's into

02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:47.359
astronomy

02:28:47.359 --> 02:28:48.880
and it's okay if you're into it as a

02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:50.880
joke but to pretend

02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:52.720
like you really know oh aquarius is

02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:54.160
always like this they're cold

02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:55.680
they don't make they make good friends

02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:57.280
but only rarely

02:28:57.280 --> 02:28:58.800
whenever okay here's what you got to do

02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:00.479
whenever you have somebody who goes uh

02:29:00.479 --> 02:29:01.359
what's your sign

02:29:01.359 --> 02:29:02.880
like after you say after you like talk

02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:04.800
like hey what's your sign don't say

02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:07.359
i'm a capricorn because no matter what

02:29:07.359 --> 02:29:08.399
you say they're gonna go

02:29:08.399 --> 02:29:11.520
i knew it it's not the way to handle it

02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:14.640
here's how you handle it you go uh why

02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:16.560
don't you guess what my sign is based on

02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:18.240
what you know of me

02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:19.920
and then there's a 1 in 12 chance we're

02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:21.680
going to get it so they're probably not

02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:23.359
gonna get it

02:29:23.359 --> 02:29:25.120
and then you just go no you're wrong

02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:26.479
it's not that and then they'll make a

02:29:26.479 --> 02:29:28.560
second guess and you might there's a

02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:30.399
1 in 11 chance that they'll get it that

02:29:30.399 --> 02:29:32.000
time and you'll probably go

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.600
no you're wrong and they'll guess again

02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:35.120
and there's a one in 10 chance

02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:37.840
and then they might get it by then and

02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:39.200
then the black guy knew it but

02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:41.920
no you didn't know it

02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:45.200
also you're not an expert you know who's

02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:46.560
an expert the [ __ ]

02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:49.359
shaman from egypt who read the stars you

02:29:49.359 --> 02:29:51.680

02:30:09.439 --> 02:30:13.200
through shane

02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:17.680
politico who else the most annoying

02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:18.640

02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:23.120
militant ones

i worked with the chick ones who used to

02:30:24.479 --> 02:30:26.160
drive by ralph's supermarkets and she

02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:29.280
would roll out of one of the yellow

02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:32.800
of [ __ ] on murderers that talk [ __ ]

02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:34.720

stars which is a lot of them

02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:44.160
um yeah i guess

02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:47.680
um i would say instead why do you

02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:50.479
think sports stars are more deserving of

02:30:50.479 --> 02:30:52.720
respect than anyone else

02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:55.359
could it be that you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

02:30:55.359 --> 02:30:57.200
for sports and you think they're more

02:30:57.200 --> 02:30:58.399

for people with disabilities is a

02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:04.319
turn-on or a turn-off

02:32:04.319 --> 02:32:05.600

02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:08.160
wheelchair yes or no okay first of all

02:32:08.160 --> 02:32:11.439
i don't approve of that work

02:32:11.439 --> 02:32:14.240
it's not wheelchair it's uh walking

02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:15.120

call it a fetish of mine because it's

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.080
not something i think about

02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:33.200
what i would call it is sort of a check

02:32:33.200 --> 02:32:34.240
box

02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:37.439
would i [ __ ] a chick in a wheelchair

02:32:37.439 --> 02:32:38.640
so that's you really asking two

02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:40.960
questions number one

02:32:40.960 --> 02:32:43.840
you're saying would i [ __ ] someone who

02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:45.200
can't walk

02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:47.840
or is it number two are you saying would

02:32:47.840 --> 02:32:49.840
i [ __ ] a chick

02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:52.000
in a wheelchair would i go on a

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:53.600
wheelchair and [ __ ] you there now

02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:55.840
here's the issue how would you do it

02:32:55.840 --> 02:32:57.120
it's like [ __ ] in the front seat of a

02:32:57.120 --> 02:32:57.920
car

02:32:57.920 --> 02:32:59.680
how are you gonna do it it's it first of

02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:01.200
all it's gotta be passenger seat

02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:03.359
you gotta be passenger seat if it's not

02:33:03.359 --> 02:33:04.240
passenger seat

02:33:04.240 --> 02:33:07.359
you're boned um

02:33:07.359 --> 02:33:10.240
the answer is yes i obviously would

02:33:10.240 --> 02:33:11.840
would you lift her up and let her

02:33:11.840 --> 02:33:13.520
[ __ ] little looks

02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:15.840
like you know flop legs just kind of

02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:16.880
like

02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:19.120
weather vein it around oh that's a

02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:20.640
pretty good impression of [ __ ] dead

02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:22.240
legs

02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:23.520
i wish you guys could see the youtube

02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:25.600
right now um

02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:27.359
yeah you lift her up let her [ __ ]

02:33:27.359 --> 02:33:29.520
puppet legs fly and then just like

02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:35.840
sit her down on you

02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:39.520
yeah for sure i'd be into that or

02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:41.520
do you let her stay in the wheelchair

02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:42.880
and you get

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:44.319
yeah that'd be really hard i mean i

02:33:44.319 --> 02:33:47.120
guess you could get on your knees

02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:49.120
and just sort of bring her forward do

02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:51.760
wheelchairs do they recline

02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:54.240
that would make it a lot easier they

02:33:54.240 --> 02:33:55.920
probably don't

02:33:55.920 --> 02:33:57.520
which is a shortcoming of the wheelchair

02:33:57.520 --> 02:33:58.560
and anyone who works in the wheelchair

02:33:58.560 --> 02:33:59.359
industry

02:33:59.359 --> 02:34:01.040
just gave you a great tip to [ __ ]

02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:03.200
corner the market

02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:04.640
yeah who wouldn't [ __ ] check it out

02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:06.800
first of all how often do they get laid

02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:09.200
not that often not that often so you're

02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:10.960
doing a service to the [ __ ]

02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:14.000
to the people who are disabled you know

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:15.359
you can go get them groceries all you

02:34:15.359 --> 02:34:18.160
want but they need a good [ __ ]

02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:20.720
god what if you couldn't get hard though

02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:21.920
that would be a problem

02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:23.280
if if you're trying to [ __ ] a chick in a

02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:24.640
wheelchair and then you just like can't

02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:27.120
get hard

02:34:27.359 --> 02:34:29.120
you know sometimes you try to [ __ ] and

02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:30.479
then you don't get hard and they're like

02:34:30.479 --> 02:34:31.920
is it me and you're like no no no it's

02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:32.479
not you

02:34:32.479 --> 02:34:33.920
or they go like which [ __ ] your

02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:35.359
problem which is like not the best

02:35:50.479 --> 02:35:52.640
we're slowly starting to move away from

02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:55.520
a capitalist way of life

02:35:55.520 --> 02:35:59.200

then then i'm not going to listen to you

02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:51.600
i was just about to ask when you're

02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:53.760
going to have her on here dude

02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:59.040

that you would have said have her on

02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:12.319

02:39:12.319 --> 02:39:14.800

02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:15.680
off this

02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:19.680
live that agrees

02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:24.319
also is it okay

02:39:24.319 --> 02:39:27.840
to smoke meth like just recreationally

02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:29.520
not like being a meth addict but just

02:39:29.520 --> 02:39:31.280
like once in a while smoking some meth

02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:33.520
i hear you uh i would say absolutely it

02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:35.439
is i would say absolutely it is and it's

02:39:35.439 --> 02:39:36.319
possibly even

02:39:36.319 --> 02:39:40.000
preferable to smoke meth once in a while

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:41.600
obviously do it in a country that uh

02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:43.520
where meth is legal

02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:46.640
um yeah

02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:49.439
dude i i don't know it's like all those

02:39:49.439 --> 02:39:51.040
drugs it's like don't you just want to

02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:53.120
try them

02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:56.080
right i i get the addiction thing to

02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:56.800
ever tell you my

02:39:56.800 --> 02:39:59.920
my so i think with heroin heroin is the

02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:01.120
the biggest of the drugs some people say

02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:03.439
it's mad i disagree i disagree

02:40:03.439 --> 02:40:06.479
i think it's heron i think it's heroin i

02:40:06.479 --> 02:40:08.000
think it's the hardest core hard drug

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.600
there is

02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:12.080
meth is pretty up there and ice is

02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:13.120
pretty up there too but

02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:15.359
i personally i say heroin so you want to

02:40:15.359 --> 02:40:16.160
do heroin

02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:17.680
or meth you can replace this but you

02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:18.720
don't want to get addicted that's the

02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:19.760
main issue you don't want to get

02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:20.720
addicted

02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:22.720
but you want to try it obviously you

02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:23.760
want to try it

02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:25.680
you've seen people go back to it over

02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:27.040
lose their whole lives for you know it

02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:29.680
must be good

02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:32.000
so i've come up with a way to smoke meth

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.560
smoke sorry heroin

02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:37.600
three times and three times only so you

02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:39.600

don't know what to expect

02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:47.359
okay because okay the bottom line is you

02:40:47.359 --> 02:40:48.319
can't get a dick you're going to lose

02:40:48.319 --> 02:40:49.200
your whole life to it

02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:52.080
but you want to try something it's like

02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:53.439
those people who try yoga

02:40:53.439 --> 02:40:54.640
and then suddenly it's like their whole

02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:57.200

um

02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:12.240
yeah every single day guys 20 to 30

02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:13.200
minute yoga

02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:15.359
and half of this me just [ __ ] around

02:41:15.359 --> 02:41:16.560
um

02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:18.640
so here's my way to do it you can try

02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:19.840
heroin but knock it

02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:22.000
three times only first time you try it

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:23.359
you don't know what to expect

02:41:23.359 --> 02:41:24.479
you're gonna get whatever you're gonna

02:41:24.479 --> 02:41:25.600
get out of it it's gonna be great

02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:26.560
probably

02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:28.319
but you might throw up that's a [ __ ]

02:41:28.319 --> 02:41:30.319
common side effect of heroin

02:41:30.319 --> 02:41:35.200
you might not but the fact is

02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:37.279
you're going to smoke it you're going to

02:41:37.279 --> 02:41:39.680
feel what it makes you feel

02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:41.120
now you're going to do it again a month

02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:42.880
later something like that two weeks

02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:43.520
later

02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:45.359
like maybe the next day now you know

02:41:45.359 --> 02:41:47.040
what you're getting with the heroine

02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:49.520
so you're gonna go into it with an idea

02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:51.120
of like i know what to expect kind of

02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:52.160
like with mushrooms the first time

02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:53.840
you're like this is [ __ ] nuts

02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:55.520
especially if you're dosed and you don't

02:41:55.520 --> 02:41:57.200
know what it is

02:41:57.200 --> 02:41:59.920
i can't imagine it must be terrible like

02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:01.840
a dose with a drug

02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:05.920
um the second time you take it

02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:07.439
you kind of know what you expect so you

02:42:07.439 --> 02:42:10.000
go into it with a [ __ ] full head of

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:11.760
about it where you're like okay this is

02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:13.040
it and then you go into and you really

02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:14.720
enjoy it you really enjoy it

02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:16.560
because you're not scared you don't know

02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:18.000
it's not like you don't know how deep

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:18.319
it's gonna

02:42:18.319 --> 02:42:19.520
you know how deep it's gonna go you just

02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:22.560
had it so that's the second time

02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:25.040
and then the third time is when you get

02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:26.319
horribly addicted

02:42:26.319 --> 02:42:28.560
[ __ ]

02:42:31.279 --> 02:42:34.640
hey all right i'm wondering

02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:37.760
if uh

02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:41.120
you and godfrey

02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:45.600
did me and godfrey resolve our issues

02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:48.160
with the goal yeah here was the issues

02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:50.000
uh he i think he asked everybody to try

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.279
to hit me or something and then the next

02:42:51.279 --> 02:42:52.800
time i saw him at the comedy cellar he

02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:53.200
was like

02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:54.960
hey man you know i don't have any big

02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:56.479
deal with you i just like should i say

02:42:56.479 --> 02:42:57.439
online

02:42:57.439 --> 02:42:59.520
he's kind of he's just kind of an actor

02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:01.200
so that's the way he acted

02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:02.640
he literally went up to me it's like hey

02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:04.640
bro like not mad at me at all

02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:06.880
and i can't even be mad at him it's like

02:43:06.880 --> 02:43:08.399
okay so you're just like

02:43:08.399 --> 02:43:11.520
putting on a show and he's like yeah i

02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:12.640
told you i was like

02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:16.319
okay yeah i guess so so yeah i guess

02:43:16.319 --> 02:43:18.399
that's the resolution

02:43:18.399 --> 02:43:21.600
it's like great talk about

02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:24.399
doing comedy during the pandemic and how

02:43:24.399 --> 02:43:25.600
that's going

02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:27.040
okay guys i think we're almost done with

02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:28.640
this this stereo thing has been great

02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:30.640
but i think we're almost done

02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:33.760
uh with the topic suggestions it has

02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:34.720
been fun

02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:36.160
but now we're just like this is like

02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:39.200
live q a this [ __ ] i'll do on my patreon

02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:41.840
um i don't know what else there is to

02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:42.720
like

02:43:42.720 --> 02:43:45.120
[ __ ] on

02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:48.319
[ __ ] on shane's hairline which is

02:43:48.319 --> 02:43:51.040
[ __ ] but

02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:57.599
[Applause]

02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:01.600
[ __ ] on traffic

02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:04.960
dude i will tell you not to [ __ ] on it

02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:06.720
but like once i started smoking pot in

02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:07.680
my car in la

02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:10.960
traffic just became not even a thing

02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:12.800
i mean there were times when in l.a was

02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:15.200
so bad it's tough to show on traffic

02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:17.600
you know i'm a new yorker so it's like i

02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:19.279
take the subway

02:44:19.279 --> 02:44:20.560
um it just doesn't traffic doesn't

02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:22.399
really bother me much

02:44:22.399 --> 02:44:26.800
um you know it does not take a subway

02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:29.279
big j okarson every time we wanted it

02:44:29.279 --> 02:44:30.800
one time we were late to sirius

02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:33.840
and um uh to do his the bonfire show and

02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:34.800
uh

02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:35.760
i was gonna go with him he's like come

02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:36.960
over to my place we'll go together i

02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:38.560
live we live in the same neighborhood

02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:39.760
and i was like let's take the subway

02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:40.800
because no no let's get in the cab would

02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:42.160
be faster and i looked on google maps

02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:43.760
which is always pretty accurate

02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:45.359
uh and i'm like no actually man it's

02:44:45.359 --> 02:44:46.720
it's there's so much traffic right now

02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:48.080
his show starts at 6 p.m

02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:51.439
we had to leave it like 5 15. it's rush

02:44:51.439 --> 02:44:53.600
hour and i'm like it's gonna take 45

02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:54.640
minutes to get there

02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:58.240
by car and 28 minutes to get there

02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:00.960
by subway so it's not faster it's

02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:02.800
actually faster it's like the subway

02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:04.720
so should we take a subway and he's like

02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:06.160
um

02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:08.720
no still not i don't know what a steal

02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:09.200
is

02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:10.399
i don't know who's in new york and

02:45:10.399 --> 02:45:13.120
doesn't take the subway even [ __ ]

02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:14.800
keanu reeve takes a subway louis c.k

02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:16.160
takes a subway up until recently i don't

02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:18.000
know if he still does

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.560
that was funny or shade saying like he

02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:22.160
would see people on the subway reading

02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:25.359
articles about him and just like

02:45:25.359 --> 02:45:27.200
it's so cute that you've come to an app

02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:28.640
and then you're yelling at us to give

02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:29.439
you

02:45:29.439 --> 02:45:31.520
content aren't you supposed to be the

02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:32.479
content group

02:45:32.479 --> 02:45:34.080

02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:46.399
i don't know how else do you do feedback

02:45:46.399 --> 02:45:48.800
on this app

02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:50.960

02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:51.840
feedback

02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:53.200
do like interactions so that's what

02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:57.840
we're doing

02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:09.840
um is there a way to go to the very

02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:12.319
beginning

02:46:13.439 --> 02:46:17.200
hey ari what do you think of people

02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:19.359
telling on their neighbors or other

02:46:19.359 --> 02:46:21.840
people when they have large groups and

02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:22.560
they're

02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:24.240
going out of orders of people what do

02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:25.920
you think about that

02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:28.479
good question that's a good question

02:46:28.479 --> 02:46:30.640
yeah there's all this tattletail stuff

02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:33.040
it's weird how i i see nobody's talking

02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:34.880
about the same things anymore

02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:36.720
like literally nobody's talking about

02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:39.520
the same arguments

02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:42.800
they'll talk about like um what's his

02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:44.560
name alex jones

02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:45.760
and they'll be like should he be banned

02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:47.359
off youtube people like well it's

02:46:47.359 --> 02:46:48.800
terrible what he did

02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:50.560
and like yeah but i don't think he's

02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:52.160
banned off youtube like oh but it was

02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:53.040
okay what he did

02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:54.720
and the thing is what did he say

02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:56.720
something like one of his conspiracies

02:46:56.720 --> 02:46:57.279
was

02:46:57.279 --> 02:46:58.960
uh one of the school shootings was made

02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:00.720
up i don't think it was made up

02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:02.800
but i loved it i hate kids i like kids

02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:04.840
love when they die

02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:08.399
um but he thinks it was made up

02:47:08.399 --> 02:47:10.160
so people like you know people went over

02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:11.760
to grieving parents and [ __ ] made fun

02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:12.960
of them

02:47:12.960 --> 02:47:14.960
people who who lost their children now

02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:17.120
they're getting [ __ ] made fun of

02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:18.840
but he's arguing a different thing he

02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:20.960
goes he wouldn't say this out loud but

02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:22.080
he would say

02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:23.840
no they're not grieving parents is what

02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:26.960
i'm saying i'm saying they're actors

02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:28.880
so there's two piece people handle this

02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:30.479
cobit thing with the large group so it's

02:47:30.479 --> 02:47:32.319
like i don't care

02:47:32.319 --> 02:47:33.920
and other people if it was a thing of

02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:36.240
like uh there's curfews

02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:38.080
um for because of booze and you're like

02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:39.439
well i'm having a lock in

02:47:39.439 --> 02:47:40.880
uh so we're all drinking but this ain't

02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:42.560
hurting anybody then you're like if you

02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:43.840
tattletail on that it's like hey [ __ ]

02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:44.880
you this doesn't even

02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:46.720
matter to you i'm doing [ __ ] a bunch

02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:48.560
of meth with my friends in my basement

02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:50.319
who cares where your next door neighbor

02:47:50.319 --> 02:47:52.160
on the ground floor you don't hear about

02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:52.640
this

02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:54.080
we didn't blow it up we're not making

02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:56.640
the meth here

02:47:57.840 --> 02:47:59.200
kobe is a little different right because

02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:00.720
if everyone gathers then it [ __ ] gets

02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:01.200
worse

02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:02.880
and you can say like i don't believe in

02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:05.040
it but the reality is

02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:06.800
the more it spreads the more the economy

02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:08.080
shuts down even if you don't think

02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:09.359
you're going to die from it

02:48:09.359 --> 02:48:10.880
you know your [ __ ] bally's is not

02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:13.120
going to be open so

02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:14.640
i don't know i don't [ __ ] tell on

02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:16.560
people i wouldn't do it

02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:19.840
but i mean would you telling somebody if

02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:20.800
somebody was like

02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:23.200
just shooting a gun at like a 20 degree

02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:24.880
angle up in the air would you call the

02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:25.439
cops

02:48:25.439 --> 02:48:26.479
or would you say like i'm not a

02:48:26.479 --> 02:48:30.399
tattletail they're not shooting at you

02:48:30.399 --> 02:48:31.600
you know it's not quite the same

02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:33.359
argument everyone's like let people do

02:48:33.359 --> 02:48:34.479
what they want it's like but it's not

02:48:34.479 --> 02:48:35.600
quite the same

02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:36.640
because somebody's going to go to the

02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:38.080
supermarket now and they're going to be

02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:40.160
eight times more likely to get covered

02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:41.520
than they were before it's not quite the

02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:42.080
same

02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:43.520
but i also get minding your own [ __ ]

02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:45.680
business all right let's do a couple

02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:46.960
more of these and then we're live

02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:48.399
we're live on stereo i think this is

02:50:55.040 --> 02:50:56.960
you got to be kidding me you don't

02:50:56.960 --> 02:50:59.120
approve of the word wheelchair

02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:02.720
but you approve of the word the f-bomb

02:51:02.720 --> 02:51:04.479
in [ __ ] yeah i'm kidding

02:51:04.479 --> 02:51:08.080
for real no not real i'm kidding

02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:11.680
that's wrong brother

02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:16.960
just as a rule of thumb you guys

02:51:16.960 --> 02:51:19.359
whenever you hear a comedian

02:51:19.359 --> 02:51:21.760
say anything that seems ridiculous or

02:51:21.760 --> 02:51:23.680
wrong or evil or

02:51:23.680 --> 02:51:26.880
or like what the [ __ ] i mean if you

02:51:26.880 --> 02:51:28.800
don't immediately go to

02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:30.880
oh they're a comedian they're probably

02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:32.399
just joking

02:51:32.399 --> 02:51:33.840
and if you're like what's the joke

02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:35.600
you're like the joke is saying

02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:37.200
ridiculous things or sometimes it's very

02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:38.880
funny

02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:40.640
i i don't know how else to explain it to

02:51:40.640 --> 02:51:42.560
you not every joke has a why the chicken

02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:43.600
crossed the road to get to the other

02:51:43.600 --> 02:51:44.560
side

02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:47.760
not all jokes are in that form i i don't

02:51:47.760 --> 02:51:49.200
know if you've seen a you ever seen

02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:50.640
like a physical comic they don't even

02:51:50.640 --> 02:51:53.200
have punch lines but they get laughs

02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:54.880
i i don't know what to tell you but

02:51:54.880 --> 02:51:57.120
they're joking

02:51:57.120 --> 02:52:01.120
maybe you know too when i [ __ ] a chick

02:52:01.120 --> 02:52:03.920
she can't walk so i guess they end up in

02:52:03.920 --> 02:52:05.520
a wheelchair so i guess yeah that's a

02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:06.479
thing yeah you had to

02:52:06.479 --> 02:52:09.120
