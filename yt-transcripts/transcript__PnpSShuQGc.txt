00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.280

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.760
in closer to us like very very very

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.000
close because these people in the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.519
background they're [ __ ]

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.840
[ __ ] [ __ ] move your head for a second

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.080

holy [ __ ] boxer wife uh

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.680

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.840
good and we are so very bad

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.519

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.120

i don't know about uh what you guys

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.240

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.840
just backfired it just makes them bigger

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.280
and more present yeah look at that guy

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.360

doubling james's age yeah but you could

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.880

my boy was just like me

00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:18.079

your penny board see you later can i

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:22.799

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.480
going to high school

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.160

00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:38.640
[ __ ]

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.480
[Music]

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.400

everything with a like bruce chrome

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.240
that's why he doesn't like his album

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.679

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:51.200

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.320
weird terms they don't actually mean

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.160
making them an object but if you say

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.079

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:50.160
treating them like something who just

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.000
drinks dicks can i say this and i think

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.680
most people would consider that i think

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.760
and alex isn't a [ __ ] dick drinking

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.800

non-human dick drinking machine alex

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.760
would you care to swallow my dick then

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.040

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.880
harsher no would you under what they're

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.440
saying objectifying alex it means i'm

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.520
like oh alex come here suck my dick or

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.839

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.720
back peddling words

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.320

obsession it was the uh miss universe

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.480
pageant

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.079
while it's sure that miss universe is

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:52.240
seen in the united states and in europe

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.960
controversy the puerto rican publicly

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.560
initially didn't see her as a puerto

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.680
rican when she entered the pageant

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.760
because she was not born on the island

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.280
doesn't speak spanish and looks american

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.440

74 billion dollars of debt well they're

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.960
rico was worth one billion dollars that

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.680
would have blown my [ __ ] mind well

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.599

watch guy it's all [ __ ] up stupid the

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.799
fact that little fat george zimmerman

01:01:30.799 --> 01:01:32.079
can even follow this black kid who's

01:01:32.079 --> 01:01:33.920
probably doing like parkour up walls or

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.359
[ __ ]

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:37.359

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.760
to shoot yeah

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.000

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.599
yeah i agree with you on that but george

01:01:47.599 --> 01:01:49.359

[ __ ] talent to be a florida cop

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.480
