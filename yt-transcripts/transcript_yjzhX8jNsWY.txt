it's gonna be a weird thing for SVU huh

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.590
they really they go for pretty good I'm

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.689
surprised how I've watched that show

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.930
always like a elderly woman share her

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.000
years and years and I've watched the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.560
progression of that show as far as like

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.200
then pulling the reins off like just let

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.190
him go well you know pretty graphic sex

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.039
stuff i but you're supposed to be

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.480
punished for it at the end of that show

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.180
right yes so we're back to almost

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.079
pilgrim type of you know there's weird

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.920
sex yeah again like a lot of people went

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.799
after Sarah Silverman for saying yeah I

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.350
was okay he asked me and I said God jerk

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.209
off I don't care yeah and a lot of

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.829
people that really mad about that

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.650
that's consenting that's - what's the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.209
wall is the anger that she said it was

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.640
okay or arguing that she was like mine

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.180
wasn't so bad yeah that Juarez was she

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.950
was like yeah I wouldn't mind side and

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.970
you know people are like well what kind

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.280
of sick person needs to jerk off and you

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.140
just like what

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.690
like I thought we were accepting of

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.260
everybody's sexual stuff until it's

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.240
always until that's you know the whole

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.830
thing a couple years ago I said how

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.080
quick was that switch from everything

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.240
was stopped slut-shaming women want to

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.430
go out and have frivolous sex and do

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.110
what they want to do don't call them

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.060
[ __ ] and [ __ ] about don't shame them

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.220
for that and then it was like if you

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.770
look at me for five seconds you have let

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.330
you know you've offended me and violated

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.830
down and I know those are extremes up

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.140
but it really it has flipped like that

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.650
well at all we're transitioning right

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.360
now this is a transition time we don't

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.670
know where it's gonna end up it seems

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.580
like scarier than ever before with that

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.400
because again that with the voice

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.550
everybody has your average working stiff

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.459
in the middle of this country it has a

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.140
social media voice and can make like a

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.209
hum that people and it stays out there

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.620
forever it's different you know there's

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.459
no more word-of-mouth

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.580
everything's everyone's opinion is on if

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.580
you just have more people on Twitter who

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.500
come against something like the world is

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.329
sort of follows well that's it I had

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.910
Jesse David Fox on from vulture today

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.970
and we were talking about the seller and

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.340
know min ba blah blah and I'm like it's

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.440
not the people who go into the seller

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.290
that are calling the seller and telling

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.140
them what to do right people in Iowa and

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.390
don't go to the seller at all

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.400
yeah I'm like how dare you I know every

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.049
time he's gone on stage it's been Louis

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.190
it's been met with like a standing

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.200
ovation almost here's the thing about

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.030
the seller the audience there is always

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.490
like I hope I get in that's their only

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.210

right just like in general but

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.270
insensitive is isn't that what you know

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.669
for I mean yes no matter who it is where

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.350
jokes should be insensitive why am i

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.220
speaking to this guy about this

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.930
[Laughter]

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.630
yes insensitivity is my thing I feel

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.000
like saying to dr. Zeus are you supposed

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.030

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.630
concern you about your acted over no

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.810
because it's I couldn't time well I wish

my I felt that way about like health and

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.300
every other thing in life but was my

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.430
comedy I could only do what I do and but

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.350
yes but again on my career that's

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.660
happened to on yours also you know watch

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.419
that go from like you knew who called

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.760
your radio show man you know who came up

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.229
to you after a show and we're great when

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.870
you'd go to a city again you'd see the

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.610
same people only but we come to see you

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.690
every time you know you build this

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.360
reporter people now I do like the fact

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.979
that through social media I get to meet

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.510
so many people who are like great fans

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.699
and just sweet people all I see on the

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.320
road or putting the face to the name

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.080
when I see them but like it's also just

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.479
rains down negativity I stay off Reddit

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.759
completely okay really yeah yeah and I

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.650
don't I try not to I have before and I

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.690
you know I'm sure I'll be guilty of it

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.220
again but I've complained a bit about

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.430
online shitty stuff but now I just kind

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.010
of roll it take it because I you know

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.919
see people Corey Feldman has a nice

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.360
argument that we've been pretty

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.159
insensitive to him throughout his uh

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.320
yeah yeah the past three and a half

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.370
years so it's like I want to be

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.949
hypocritical were his boogeyman of

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:28.180
whatever that is you know like people

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.770
who were kind of like putting on a

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.199
national platform re-airing and laughing

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.060
at his music performance well why don't

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.340
we just go on as anonymous people and

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.710
then complain to say that they're doing

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.780
you lose your Jim many things you could

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.520
never even begin to guess and my

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.250
daughter just probably looks like in

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.620
1984 she would have been like you know

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.539
building a computer or something with

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:51.820
the knowledge he has and now there's

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.610
people being born or even going in the

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.620
first grade that she's gonna feel like

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.900
from a different world than her you know

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.419
this happens like every couple of years

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.880
now it used to happen you know once the

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.740
generation that was the generation gap

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.220
now it's like the three four year gap

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.770
between one in the other and also you

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.300
hit an age where technology moving

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.430
forward sort of scares you

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.440
oh yeah you don't want it like now I see

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.600

yeah it's too scary you know it's too

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:33.009
I'm just moving stuff around in the air

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:34.870

scared I wouldn't let me in the house

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.539

00:07:56.229 --> 00:08:02.800
thing yeah that's my dog right there fun

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.190
hey boy yeah he eats nothing well he

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.900
eats children and I I just put in bone

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.660
just break bones whatever you do am I am

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.180
I crazy to think that the I've watched

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.889
the evolution of the technology come

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:19.660
through television as think it's more

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.849
tangible for me in my world yeah because

00:08:21.849 --> 00:08:24.940
I vivid Matt I almost have muscle memory

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.010
of thinking about me and Mike Vecchio

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.860
and my parents gave me a 50 summer

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.279
screen television that was you know the

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.500
he the speaker was the whole bottom yeah

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.599
just crazy heavy cabinet that it was in

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:39.130
and taking that up three flights of

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.839
stairs and almost killing like that you

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:43.240
know yeah used to take two three feet

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.680
behind it and yeah yeah it had to had

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.350
the big it was a deep he has very very

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.959
deep and that was like a big deal to get

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:54.910
that TV because I think it had high def

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.740
and I was a big deal for me and now my

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.310
TV like a 70 inch TV I can hold myself

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.900
yeah that's crazy

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.060
they're not even heavy and it's crit and

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.430
and there's so much more powerful and

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.370
and yet no one knows how to fix it no

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.589
one knows how to fix anything you're

00:09:11.589 --> 00:09:13.480
right about that people used to fix cars

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.760
like in my neighborhood people would be

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.310
at night just have cars up neighbors

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.660
would whatever what are you working on

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.640
and I know I've never anybody with a

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.740
hood up now it's a we started watching

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.470
this morning season two I guess with

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.950
making a murderer

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.050
and they showed the Averys they still

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.630
have the auto body company or mechanic

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.360
shop and it just shows them in there

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.149
like just reaching in the dad's he's no

00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:40.130
80 years old and he's bending something

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.170
with a vise grip and trying to make

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.760
something fit they even said if he was

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.010
goes and retire somewhere he the son was

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.389
like I have to get my dad a couple of

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:48.889
cars just to work on because he just

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:52.730
wants to do that and yeah my dad might

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.519
be his age might be the last generation

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.410
of that being a thing I know there's

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.420
individuals who have it but I don't

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.040
think my dad grew up any kind of special

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.410
way no he's just getting but he also has

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.350
to work on old cars yeah yeah but he

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.510
came there's no way there's no they hook

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.649
it up to a computer and tells you

00:10:09.649 --> 00:10:12.320
something that fancy but my dad yeah I

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.720
remember him going to the to the

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.209
automotive store and buying spark plugs

00:10:17.209 --> 00:10:19.910
and Sean can explain to me why bull fire

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.449
yeah the rated it'll burn gasoline

00:10:22.449 --> 00:10:25.250
faster because it's dual fire it was a

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.720
big deal from the Pathet in his car and

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.399
I mean I don't even know where they go I

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:30.860
couldn't see but he he may have showed

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.269
me I guess if I showed any interest in

00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:33.470
it but I really did I you know I was

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.120
living with my mom all the time so I was

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.910
more like Boy George I'm T and that's

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.579
did genuinely with my am why you do your

00:10:40.579 --> 00:10:42.140
dad is going to Front Street and race

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:47.300
him for pain did you ask him what you

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.699
said about comedy clubs in the episode

00:10:49.699 --> 00:10:51.380
after all we said it after he was with

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.420
you guys I guess it was after meeting

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.579
you masculinity they should all be burnt

00:10:58.579 --> 00:11:00.050
down I was surprised he said that

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.870
actually bow as I go way back with Bono

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.510
when he was 16 we did a gig in England

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.040
together with his father and when he

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.690
came in here he was great he really said

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.470
uh he said in here because I've always

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.329
like stated in interviews that you were

00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:16.579
right very nice to me out of the gates I

00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:17.810
got one of the people he remembers is

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.069
just being super sweet so when he came

00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:20.449
to New York at first mhm

00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:21.740
I was like you know I'll look after I

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.180
didn't have to though I mean right then

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.829
and there like the YouTube videos popped

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:28.040
for him and he was yeah he left NYU in

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.019
like months and started just being like

00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:32.839
yeah pretty famous and yet his audience

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:35.329
yeah for sure but yeah I didn't fully

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:37.430
hear what he said but he's saying the

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.529
comedy clubs are just masculine [ __ ]

00:11:39.529 --> 00:11:41.000
now is that essentially what it is

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.089
masculinity that sucks they should be

00:11:44.089 --> 00:11:47.050
burned down which I agree with

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.199
we went to see Florence in the machine a

00:11:50.199 --> 00:11:52.819
couple weeks cards well I love Florence

00:11:52.819 --> 00:11:58.189
I hate the machine but they go she says

00:11:58.189 --> 00:11:59.629
in the concert she goes I don't think

00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:01.639
there's any toxic masculinity of the

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:03.139
Florence and the Machine concert and

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:03.529
those one

00:12:03.529 --> 00:12:11.180
check your screeners [ __ ] and John

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.769
popper may have said the funniest thing

00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:14.420
of all time when he came in here I go

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.339
you know it's an unhittable show

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:18.050
Florence admission you can't heckle her

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.610
like this she's just like a goddess on

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.160
stage twirling around like I didn't even

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.050
buy into it and I was just like but

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.459
there's nothing I could say about it I

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:26.750
want to make fun in the moment as she's

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.029
killing it as a front woman John popper

00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:30.529
goes yeah you can heckle anybody watch

00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:32.750
it's easy he goes tastes something that

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.240
she said on stage I went oh the

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.850
microphone noise is just angels music

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:46.819
knees because you're fat Christine went

00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:49.129
to see him that Friday yeah in Jersey

00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:52.250
yeah good show sure harmonica huh

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.660
I think he may have been hammered by the

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.850
end of the show just strong chance he

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.949
had don't make it that person but maybe

00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:59.839
a bad person oh I love it

00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:01.759
he'd bring out like an Indian lady just

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:04.069
to sing some kind of noise and he would

00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:06.259
just like flirt with her with harmonica

00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:08.600
music which is hilarious also any job

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.819
you can be drunk at is a good job I

00:13:10.819 --> 00:13:13.040
always thought it's true it's very very

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.139
true car Metzger said it I quoted it

00:13:15.139 --> 00:13:17.300
last night said it years ago he was

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.300
arguing with a girlfriend and leaving to

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.680
go do you think on tops got to go to

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.180
work to go do comedy

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.980
mmm-hmm and she was warming smoking pot

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.509
and telling dick jokes and bullshitting

00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:28.250
with your friends he goes yeah it's a

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.050
great job that's why I picked it I can't

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.610
help that you decide to become a graphic

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.689
designer it's such a true thing that

00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:37.490
bums me out that uh that both said that

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.350
but you know whatever I don't think I

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.180
think he's sort of out of the comedy

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.029
club you know he would do theaters if he

00:13:44.029 --> 00:13:45.649
was gonna go on tour and he just pops

00:13:45.649 --> 00:13:48.050
into the places that a little more off

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.769
pass in LA I think anyway but I mean I

00:13:50.769 --> 00:13:54.010
don't know the docks of masculinity that

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.530
the lowest oh I'm interested in the lily

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.690
sarah silverman thing because what I

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.050
heard of her on Howard was the hour

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.180
saying that like it wasn't a problem

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.660
because he didn't have rank on her but

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.420
also she said yes yes isn't that the

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.030
thing that you have sex with people that

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.140
want to have sex with you

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.870
that is tends to be more the fan but

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:17.410
she's uh

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.360
I've known lily forever I'm IMing excuse

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.620
from so please don't take it this way

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.620
we're peers were equals when we were

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.000
kids he has to be masturbating from me

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.560
sometimes I go [ __ ] yeah I want to see

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.550
that so yeah well his accuser came out

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:34.900
and said like I was here too that's a

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.520
different but is a different thing

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.120
mm-hmm

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.650
but his accuser saying I was a

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.510
speartooth and exactly that's what I'm

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:41.950
saying it's the argument that she's

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:42.580
making

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.380
it's a consent argument is that he

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.570
didn't specifically ask them if he could

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.460
do it he started doing it and by them

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.430
not saying no he took as a yes but they

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:55.540
never actually said they just didn't

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.160
leave the situation I don't know what

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.720
happened but I can't I don't wanna make

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.550
assumptions but the idea of it just

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.530
being all eye contact conversation when

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:03.850
you're jerking off and froze her buddy

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.680
and she's making a face like I don't

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.300
know and he's like hmm they were

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.980
laughing at him and I think he's into

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.620
the humiliation that's again that's part

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.780
of the Elders kids meant that they got

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.840
to hear this [ __ ] that sucks his

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.220
daughters are probably people probably

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.420
walking up to his daughters at school

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.430
making like jerk-off motions and going

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.560
through all that with them so for the

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.120
family they were doing that just based

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.230
on some of the show's producer

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.480
they had to do this to the consider her

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.240
to suppose or Louie to prolific bro

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:39.060
ten prolific yeah I mean it's his he was

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.740
the thing about Sarah she just gave her

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.200
opinion and everybody got mad it wasn't

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.510
like she said look everybody this is the

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.100
defining way for everybody to think

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.470
she's saying that in her think but I

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.940
almost feel like again to the uh to the

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.190
point is that sometimes she'd go [ __ ]

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.440
yeah I want to see that sometimes he's a

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.170
[ __ ] no gross and we got pizza that

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:07.470
very mixed signals time to Todd Group

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.960
one time saying emphatically I [ __ ] yeah

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.670
to go on like no gross is a real like a

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:23.250
loop women am i right guys Supreme Court

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.350
Judge Louise DK can do comedy there we

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.070
go

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.170
I mean really that should be the case on

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.690
some but somebody doing jokes in a

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.640
nightclub they took everything from him

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.100
he definitely had consequence from his

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:40.020
actions well so he so then he came back

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.520
Simmons coming through a sharp response

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.910
from Rebecca Cory what was the response

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.680
gonna see that I think to be real clear

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.950
CK had nothing to offer me as I was is

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.260
equal on the set the day he decided to

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.600
sexually harass me he took away I did I

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.760
worked years for and still has no

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.380
remorse he's a predator victimized women

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.850
for decades a lot about now it didn't

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.500
eat he did express remorse I believe

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.340
didn't he yeah being admired a lot in

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.780
his apology which people didn't like

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:15.300
that he did yeah but that's uh I don't

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.070
know but didn't isn't Sarah Silverman's

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:20.490
reaction no sort of I feel like she can

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.730
come out and have the same complaint as

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.500
Rebecca courrier or any of the people

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.800
accusing Louis he just chose to handle

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.930
it almost in a way that Christine it's

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.280
kind of said before to not even that you

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.930
go for it or not but just sort of like

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.880
where's your thing of just being like

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.220
yeah and I'm walking away and

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.080
everybody's different having the world

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:40.580
move

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.490
was true she has a very successful

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:47.210
career so a lot of this is then you know

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.309
the accusers kind of feel like the

00:17:49.309 --> 00:17:51.649
incident affected their careers

00:17:51.649 --> 00:17:53.570
negatively whereas Sarah Silverman has

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.159
this you know amazing glorious career

00:17:55.159 --> 00:17:57.620
herself but you can't really but here's

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.210
the thing - why can't people just talk

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:02.000
about it and maybe through that talking

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.610
you might hear something know they go

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.100
that makes you go oh okay but we're at a

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.419
point right now that no one's even

00:18:08.419 --> 00:18:10.549
allowed to talk you're not allowed to

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:11.630
talk at all

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.909
yeah the lack of discussion is pretty

00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:16.010
gross about the whole thing and

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.260
everything goes right to rape and right

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.169
to assault wait and then it just you

00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:23.870
have men get defensive and there's no

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.029
common ground on one like I feel like we

00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:27.380
need to renegotiate the way men and

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.880
women behave with each other and we need

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.320
to talk to each other to figure that out

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.539
I have plenty of great men in my life

00:18:32.539 --> 00:18:34.039
that have probably all done some

00:18:34.039 --> 00:18:35.570
fucked-up [ __ ] to girls and I've done

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:41.899
[ __ ] up [ __ ] in my life - Christina

they're gonna ask her about

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.779
no it's consonant and it is a kind of

00:19:47.779 --> 00:19:50.149
like and last year her sister also

00:19:50.149 --> 00:19:51.380

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.070
approximately 20 times she counted yeah

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.779
before he was famous

00:19:56.779 --> 00:19:58.399
after that it was Luisa came across

00:19:58.399 --> 00:20:00.649
combs ship before he was famous yeah I

00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:02.899
was flying it wasn't criminal but

00:20:02.899 --> 00:20:05.750
compulsive rude and gross I mean I guess

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:10.250
I don't know I what I admire is the

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.610
wrong word but I am envious in some way

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.440
of his just kind of gumption the right

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:28.460
word for that I think it is I'm already

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.950
apologizing and taking some time I

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.820
believe it is that like listen I'm so in

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.830
I'm an insecure person and I got Louise

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.570
successful has money everything but I'm

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.490
this is not a Diggle I'm he's not a guy

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.350
that's known for being like the handsome

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:46.159
Hollywood heartthrob and he's confident

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:48.679
enough to just whip his [ __ ] ginger

00:20:48.679 --> 00:20:50.840
wine out and just start whacking in

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.950
front of people

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.409
I'm like I think they'll go for this

00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:57.289
that's very brazen I think Christine hit

00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:58.940
it when it's option it's a young

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.070
immolation thing you know I mean it's a

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.429
kink kink it is and I also wonder if

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:06.350
because he was with somebody for so long

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.690
if that was his way of like getting rode

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:12.799
[ __ ] without cheating like I'm how he

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:14.929
justified like I'm gonna do I'm just

00:21:14.929 --> 00:21:16.850
working off I'm not actually cheating

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.620
I'm gonna distance myself from road

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:26.750
[ __ ] I'm trying to stay in the middle

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.090
of every pack right now when people go

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.820

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.260

00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:46.909
ders never been about it he's always

00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:49.610

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:53.000
the stand one night when a girl came up

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.580

finds chicks that meets I'm good for him

00:22:14.809 --> 00:22:17.510

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:22.039
would approach him with her number the

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:23.840
confidence you know you know he was

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.840

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:39.790
like Tony Danza I've been drawing

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.590
everything down and I came up with Tony

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.500

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:58.480
very mechanical but still great yeah

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.790
it's fun I mean this model in the window

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:01.990

happen I had to do it I'm not against it

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.070
if I when I would do that yeah but the

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:09.900
worst thing is when they say hurry up

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.060
that would be awful the first time I

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.190
went to Amsterdam I ran in with one just

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:16.810
because the other two I said I was there

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.030
with two black comics who were not

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.200
sharing and they were a little older

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.090
than me they were not sharing the same

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.040

back together but I was really saying

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.330
that for me yeah I was kind of afraid to

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.320
be there on my own

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:38.650
I was 22 maybe and and we went out there

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:43.330

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.760

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.830
couldn't get into it and she's like you

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.090
got a payment for the time I go alright

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.590
and then it--so I gave her the money

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.440
whatever that was that rang and it

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.670
wasn't then I forget what it was called

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.710
their money but like I gave her whatever

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.230
and then all this change fell out of my

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.900
pocket like their change yeah

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.370
and she goes can I have that and I was

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.500
like whatever just leave me okay I just

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.120
wanted out at that point I was so

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.800
ignorant and she took all that change

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.630
and then those guys told me that those

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.450
coins were all like dollars dollars five

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.220
dollars two dollars but here's the thing

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.280
you paid her not to feel there are which

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.920
is you know yeah just

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.250
that almost should be on an SUV that

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.330
doesn't seem fair

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:52.330
they rode I did pay or not to for sure

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.490
but I would I'm not against the idea of

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.010
prostitution even a little bit I've

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.640
definitely and now I do feel like I said

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.530
when I used to drive escorts and

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:04.620
strippers to bachelor parties and stuff

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.940
like driving home and hearing their

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.360
stories was always just like yeah but

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.190
you know what else is awful is when you

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:13.990
got to carry block for living you know I

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.820
mean like there's a lot of horrible

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.010
things you hear with your body and I've

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.570
come home with jobs that I'd [ __ ]

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:20.280
hurt

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.950
like physically hurt like what the [ __ ]

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.110
maybe blowing somebody might be like

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.290
yeah I worked UPS one night I got black

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.120
lung I thought I was coughing up ass to

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.950
it now you're not supposed to do that

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.750
you're not supposed to have to breathe

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.160
like that so I got out of there quick

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:43.030
trucks yeah which that day somewhere out

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.560
in the world I own many apologies

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.350
because there's a hold I'm like the last

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.540
I'm the last line of defense of making

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.190
sure the bright boxes are going in the

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:53.650
truck my right truck and get rid of the

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:55.780
ones that are wrong and just by numbers

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.820
there's gonna be a lot long and I never

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.610
looked at the that whole night no zip

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:02.230
codes on my thing it was like a hundred

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.800
zip

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.090
not without exaggerating 25 30 zip codes

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.950
and you'd look at every box to make sure

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.230
was one of those unless it that way and

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.700
then the boxes were coming in and

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.140
falling off the sides I felt pressure

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.840
yes sure and then I was sweating and

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.730
breathing heavy covered in black to

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.720
small those boxes and then I went home

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.790
it's not rocketed to black horrible

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.160
things and then my mom's just a soap my

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.050

baby doesn't have to go back and work

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.700

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.350
always be the thing like when you would

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.020
load a truck it would be the thing of

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.420
accomplishment and it would pull out as

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:46.630
an empty truck came in you know when

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.790

no whereas somebody might have a

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.070
drinking problem like I said something I

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.300
was like Ann you were drunk that and I

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.250
wish me as he goes what are you bringing

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:25.830
up the drinking is it a problem well you

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.420
tried maintaining your alcohol when

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:34.950
you're all coked up just doing shots

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.480
well I mean I don't see Lois ever like

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.070
day drinking or anything at all but I

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.990
mean like he was definitely sipped up

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:43.220
tonight that fight for sure he was I

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.240
don't know any of the details

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.610
what started I'll give you a brief

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:51.090
overview is that Curt and Lewis had a

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:54.210
fight argument bad argument six months

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:58.470
ago at Bray a comedy club in LA but it

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:59.760
was basically it was really actually

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.340
over Lewis being upset that Curt's

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.840
always reachable to him can't really

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.330
argue that very much on broadcast

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.300
particularly and like in comedy club

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.870
situations he feels and Curt is a weirdo

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.420
did a weird thing and glue is severely

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.220
overreacted to Curt's weird think Curt

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.300
lit him to get him off stage with his

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.860
phone that's what kind of started the

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.240
whole thing and Lewis is just like you

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.970
know that's the last straw and I'm

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:28.950
saying something about it and it got WAY

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.710
overheated went on for months and months

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:32.970
Plato would they're not near each other

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.580
it went on for a couple days and then no

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:38.510
catch up at all and then all of a sudden

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:41.130
we found ourselves back out in LA and

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.610
they had a bad interaction Lois kind of

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.220
like I guess he took him to snub him and

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.470
didn't you know acknowledge him when he

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:52.410
walked by Curt and Curt blew up and then

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.480
Lewis blew up and then we had Curt on

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.850
the show and figuring my stupid thought

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.560
was all these guys are buddies

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.300
that ultimately like we can get him

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.190
sitting make funny together and

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.210
something will come you know I mean

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:06.360
it'll it'll squash but instead what

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.650
happened behind you happens is Lewis

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.880
goes the throw

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.450
I think we're past that now right yeah

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:18.120
yeah we are we're definitely passing the

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.320
last thing yeah we're definitely passed

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.530

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:25.380

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.100
way Curt leaned forward to half get up

but did not get up we were busting balls

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.690

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.300

double G a B L

00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:43.329
mom's dead bud that thing was on a line

00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:45.700
doing comedy just goes haywire have you

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.930

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:48.970
thing when he was if I could started

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:51.819
haywire before but the first time that I

00:35:51.819 --> 00:35:53.529
got heckled when little Mike's down in

00:35:53.529 --> 00:35:54.099
Florida

00:35:54.099 --> 00:35:55.930

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.779
the guy's [ __ ] head came off the

00:35:58.779 --> 00:36:01.180
stage I like the pro comics we're gonna

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.999
like hey man we have like things like

00:36:03.999 --> 00:36:05.859
there's a stop lines that you can say to

00:36:05.859 --> 00:36:08.630
them like what you talking about

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:11.709
[Music]

00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:20.529
and like when I was little my I remember

00:36:20.529 --> 00:36:22.720
my dad my brother said if anybody starts

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.480
making funny sooner or later you might

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.489
as well get it over with so as soon as

00:36:27.489 --> 00:36:29.470
you said like you suck or this bed sucks

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:31.569
I just chucked the [ __ ] glass at him

00:36:31.569 --> 00:36:33.369
I had to stand there way people are

00:36:33.369 --> 00:36:41.470
going look you didn't know wasn't their

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:44.049
beauty and being raised by lungs to some

00:36:44.049 --> 00:36:46.329
degree that's just over now you're being

00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:47.910
raised but you're being raised by woke

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.440
curly moustache barista queefs

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.499
is the simplicity to life like you

00:36:53.499 --> 00:36:55.509
understand how life works pretty early

00:36:55.509 --> 00:36:59.470
my dad gave me very few life lessons at

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.150
all but he did give me all he definitely

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:03.279
wanted his son to be like I'm by the way

00:37:03.279 --> 00:37:05.529
you probably saw how not manly I was

00:37:05.529 --> 00:37:07.539
getting being raised by me so much yeah

00:37:07.539 --> 00:37:08.410
they probably made him very nervous

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:09.730
because he would give me all of those

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:12.430
like and I applied them as best I could

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.739
but all of those like don't waste all

00:37:14.739 --> 00:37:16.119
the time talking if the guy's talking

00:37:16.119 --> 00:37:17.410
this [ __ ] he's the one it's afraid to

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:18.999
most like hit him first I'll never see

00:37:18.999 --> 00:37:20.920
that comment my dad's rule was literally

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.070
like always throw the first punch

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.590
like so you just went around [ __ ] sucker

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:30.630
punch wait for there to be a problem I'm

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.090
undefeated chain and that is rule 2 is

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.500
never getting a fight you definitely

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:48.240

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:52.020

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.770

local girls because you know they could

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.000

bought big kid and he was he was out of

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:15.330
high school he was like 24 he was so

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.700
much bigger that he found actually there

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.860
starting running back and he was doing

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.320
wrestling moves to him in this fight he

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.680
gave him a [ __ ] lion tamer a lion

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.630
tamer and the kid was crying while he

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:29.200
was giving him a lion tent

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.940
crying is begging for help when

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.560
someone's cut their hands clasped under

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.500
your chin right is lifting you up that's

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.790
really great a lion-tamer

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:43.680
[Laughter]

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.710
that's so funny because I think you can

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:54.910
just get out of that the guy's like 350

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:56.830
pounds the line has been tamed yeah

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:59.020
let's figure I had a friend that when we

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.670
were kids I saw him knock out a man

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:02.350
before like there was a kid in my

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.420
neighborhood and this is the weirdest

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.880
thing I just saw him a few nights ago he

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.130
came to a show that I was doing really

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.380
much of those [ __ ] guys did and then

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:14.260
I ended up just telling crazy old

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.200
stories to the audience that's great but

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.560
this [ __ ] kid he hit a guy in the

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.600
nose and like his Devi's nose bleeding

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:35.890
the nose that way and then I would never

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.180
think to get night I've never even

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.920
gotten into fights with people older

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.160
than me at any phase always with my age

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.900
generally and maybe I guess is like an

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.370
older they may been old of you I

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:46.450
wouldn't have looked in it that way like

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:49.570
you know 23 25 or something but I never

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:51.250
want words I was never like 15 and beat

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:53.110
up like an 11-year old I punched the kid

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:57.640
once when you were yeah I was it I was

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.050
drunk at a high school basketball game

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.130
my friend's little brothers were in like

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:04.540
six or seventh grade and they're like

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:16.780

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:27.070

real why are we making terminators

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:57.370

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.150

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:03.460
reprogram our own hack into the army and

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:04.750

you're worried about it being a robot

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.880

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.970

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:42.829
would just take a picture with that take

00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:44.299
a picture Jacob's face without telling

00:46:44.299 --> 00:46:45.260
him right there in there because he was

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.319
looking at that doll like how many

00:46:48.319 --> 00:46:50.180
thousands away am i from own and that

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:55.789
would you [ __ ] that Jacob she's pretty

00:46:55.789 --> 00:46:57.470
hot that's not the way that's not the

00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:59.750
answer you wouldn't [ __ ] it you wouldn't

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:04.400
give it a whirl the stigma I'd bang bang

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:09.470
the old scientist I want to touch the

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:11.000
eye with the hands to touch me that

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.619
built that thing honestly though Jacob

00:47:12.619 --> 00:47:13.400
you dude

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.799
you do talk like a guy who would [ __ ] a

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:23.509
robot good call it she she seems like a

00:47:23.509 --> 00:47:26.359
lovely girl but I don't know you gotta

00:47:26.359 --> 00:47:30.650
be pronoun specific because Alec Baldwin

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:32.480
and Kim Kardashian did you see the [ __ ]

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.630
that they took they were talking about

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:44.359
her step mom they all but said it rose

00:47:44.359 --> 00:47:47.779
yes they were using the dead name which

00:47:47.779 --> 00:47:49.400
is bad you're not allowed to say Bruce

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.150
any point and they also would say he

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:55.190
instead of

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:58.349
man [ __ ] hilarious well the girls

00:47:58.349 --> 00:48:00.569
Kylie and Kendall just still call him

00:48:00.569 --> 00:48:04.079
dad or her call her dad so it is a weird

00:48:04.079 --> 00:48:07.940
dynamic cuz they refer to her as her but

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:11.160
stop calling me that you [ __ ] she's

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:15.770

this week was a bummer look Christine

01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.130

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:17.320

01:17:26.139 --> 01:17:28.749
not live Christine's emotion I'll just

01:17:28.749 --> 01:17:31.150
remind everybody of the theme to the

01:17:31.150 --> 01:17:32.440
Poseidon Adventure

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.659
huh well I mean they could have a

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.219
massive turnaround but what's it gonna

01:17:45.219 --> 01:17:47.769
be the [ __ ] truth was this makes the

01:17:47.769 --> 01:17:50.079
last year even more magical because they

01:17:50.079 --> 01:17:53.260
weren't [ __ ] good it was a nice lucky

01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:55.780
run that they got on thank God when

01:17:55.780 --> 01:18:00.820

01:18:20.769 --> 01:18:21.579
is here man

01:18:21.579 --> 01:18:23.650
I thought it was the cornerbacks then

01:18:23.650 --> 01:18:25.690
the cornerbacks played great and then

01:18:25.690 --> 01:18:28.389
the line blew then the cornerbacks came

01:18:28.389 --> 01:18:29.829
back and start playing shitty they're

01:18:29.829 --> 01:18:31.360
over to hang over there

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:34.260
they won the Superbowl they think it's

01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:36.239

01:18:36.239 --> 01:18:37.920

some people jumping off of it so they

01:21:35.559 --> 01:21:37.059
don't get buried in the bottom that is

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:39.690
terrifying

01:21:40.469 --> 01:21:42.719
by the way that almost happens every

01:21:42.719 --> 01:21:50.010
time I go to Kips Bay movie theater like

01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:51.900

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:57.660

01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.360

every escalator takes seven minutes

01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:03.480
somebody posted this was like I guess

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.650
Mitch Hedberg was wrong

01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:08.220
[Laughter]

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:17.690
[Laughter]

01:22:17.690 --> 01:22:22.020
angry not from heroin in my feet I'm

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.760
probably fine I don't need a doctor for

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.830
this do I

01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:27.270
Manti Te'o was just dumb from day one

01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:29.130
you're saying yeah I believe he actually

01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:31.920
got catfished like I think he wasn't

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.989
faking now of course he's like I started

01:22:33.989 --> 01:22:35.160
to not like him because he did start to

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.440
act out for the cameras that season look

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.880
after his fake girlfriend died and he

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.170
did pretend to be a little emotional

01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:45.150
about it but I'm sure he has dude yeah

01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:47.430
the to heart a fans loves eating [ __ ]

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:50.210
so he says I love eating [ __ ] man time

01:22:50.210 --> 01:22:55.890
we're both [ __ ] drowning in it I

01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:57.960
think the two people you can't take

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.060
seriously on a football field is Manti

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:03.300
Te'o and incognito was he the one who

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:08.160
was getting picked on the one that got

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.469
picked on how do you go to practice the

01:23:10.469 --> 01:23:13.290
next night he was no it's fine now I'll

01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:15.270
play I just wanted to gone because he

01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:17.430
was not cool to me it's - yeah weird

01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:20.449
thing to say at a football practice

01:23:20.449 --> 01:23:22.469
imagine how much of a bull you have to

01:23:22.469 --> 01:23:26.160
be to bully another NFL player in Bowie

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:28.620
he was I think is how much of a not

01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:31.320
prepared true for this situation that

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.630
kid was I think mark Cal volts is going

01:23:33.630 --> 01:23:35.190
through the same thing he never looks

01:23:35.190 --> 01:23:38.460
happy when you see him playing he never

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.870
looks excited nothing for killing

01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:45.360
fantastic I think Markoff Boltzmann City

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.290
was going through the same thing he

01:23:46.290 --> 01:23:47.910
doesn't look happy to be playing in the

01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:48.660
NBA

01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:50.730
it looks like a nightmare every night we

01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:52.500
has to go out there and by the way the

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.360
crowd I love Philly doesn't give a [ __ ]

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.370
the announcers start staying at at this

01:23:56.370 --> 01:23:57.960
point now - every time he touches the

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.420
ball they just start going nuts like and

01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:02.610
yelling shoot you he just pranks up

01:24:02.610 --> 01:24:03.270
garbage

01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:07.680
anybody go the announcers like maybe if

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:09.450
he just hustles a bunch I don't know

01:24:09.450 --> 01:24:10.680
like they don't know what to say

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:18.720
Tim when he was a kid he's the next

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.690
victim is the wizard no lengths louis

01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:25.650
c.k will go yeah I think he's gonna turn

01:24:25.650 --> 01:24:27.300
instead they're playing now tonight I'm

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:28.920
gonna go home and watch it I don't think

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:32.130
this he might not have it they're gonna

01:24:32.130 --> 01:24:35.010
watch the World Series now I don't care

01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:38.120
about baseball at all I can't the

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.990
Phillies did it to me when I was after

01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:43.560
93 World Series they didn't make the

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:46.020
playoffs for 13 years I think I'm right

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.840
about that 13 and I just I thinks I'm a

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.760
person if I watch like I watch 82 if I

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:54.030
can I'll stay with that 10 games i watch

01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:56.760
on recaps online just for time alone I'm

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.700
just not gonna get to it before I was

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:02.700
fighting with the score is but about 70

01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:04.470
some-odd games i watch for the Sixers a

01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:08.640
year i watch 16 unless you know unless

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.710
they're out of the playoffs and I have

01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:12.720
something else I have to do I watch

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.880
every Eagles game so it's like with

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.250
baseball I want to watch it'll consume

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:19.290
so much of my time for a sport that I

01:25:19.290 --> 01:25:21.540
just find it I have a friend Jared who's

01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:23.180
a Yank yo what up dupes

01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:25.490
[Music]

01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:30.240
he was in the kosher park mascot boy he

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.130
he watches the Yankees he watches every

01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:35.940
single game your friendship goes on

01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:39.300
hiatus because he cannot heard a he

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.130
watches everything he won't DVR and

01:25:41.130 --> 01:25:42.810
won't go out he literally will not go

01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:44.820
out I'll see also watching it live well

01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:46.020
the reason I could watch every game

01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:49.230
especially a basketball is I DVR most of

01:25:49.230 --> 01:25:50.910
them so I'll go I'll watch the game

01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:52.410
tonight no commercial watch like a

01:25:52.410 --> 01:25:55.860
Yankees Blue Jays doubleheader just sit

01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:58.290
through it the reason why I won't do

01:25:58.290 --> 01:25:58.620
that

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:01.290
like [ __ ] tape a game because I feel

01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:02.310
like an idiot

01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:06.000
I'm cheering the games over and we lost

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.140
I mean I can't ever like ah that's the

01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:12.030
that to me is the most foolish thing a

01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:14.460
person could do and Nick DiPaolo told me

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:17.490
that he hasn't watched a [ __ ] game

01:26:17.490 --> 01:26:21.170
live since VCRs that's how far back Wow

01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:25.410
I'll text him go do you have this on are

01:26:25.410 --> 01:26:29.130
you watching it yeah I can't you watch

01:26:29.130 --> 01:26:31.530
only live yeah you're live where you

01:26:31.530 --> 01:26:34.080
won't do it like I don't do it though oh

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.680
wow I like watching it on TV same way

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.090
library you won't do it live there's too

01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:41.220
much I look at my phone too much people

01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:43.050
talk to me too much so you only get that

01:26:43.050 --> 01:26:46.350
feeling 16 times a year right but this

01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:48.510
is you don't deserve that feeling if

01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:51.510
it's already happened that's insane how

01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:57.060
do you like holy [ __ ] five hours later

01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:59.520
going like all right when's that last

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.910
shot to get you could absolutely but

01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:04.920
another thing happens to with a remote

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.500
sometimes it's nice if you're not stuck

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:10.260
on vest and it jumps like 15 minutes

01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:12.150
ahead and they just see like you know it

01:27:12.150 --> 01:27:13.500
was like a two-point game with three

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.640
minutes left then you just see the

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.090
Sixers like palm no no yeah I did that

01:27:18.090 --> 01:27:19.650
last year at Notre Dame played Stanford

01:27:19.650 --> 01:27:21.240
and it was tied in the fourth quarter

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.800
and then literally in a four minute

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.330
stretch Stanford scored three touchdowns

01:27:24.330 --> 01:27:27.180
like scored pick six fumbled the kickoff

01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:29.010
school and I like fast forward I was

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:30.150
like this is going pretty well let's see

01:27:30.150 --> 01:27:39.900
let's get this commercial you think of

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.720
like the really little kid okay yeah and

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.580
it goes the Notre Dame that's all I'm

01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:46.290
gonna tell you but it gets in the last

01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:51.740
game it's a sec what's so [ __ ] good

01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:55.530
Rudy at least still far more true to the

01:27:55.530 --> 01:27:57.930
actual story than invincible

01:27:57.930 --> 01:28:00.660
Vince Batali when they show the Vince

01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:02.349
Papale II play right after

01:28:02.349 --> 01:28:04.510
the movie and you're like that's not

01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:05.829
exactly what they just showed in this

01:28:05.829 --> 01:28:08.920
movie never made it even to a playoff

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:10.659
game they cut him as soon as the Eagles

01:28:10.659 --> 01:28:17.139
got decent like three seasons and he

01:28:17.139 --> 01:28:23.440
left ugly like [ __ ] you when he went out

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.780
shitty that's like everybody does his

01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:28.770
daughter his daughter is the floorshow

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:31.989
manager right

01:28:31.989 --> 01:28:35.409
really and he and the one game I went to

01:28:35.409 --> 01:28:36.610
last year I thought they were gonna let

01:28:36.610 --> 01:28:39.250
me ring the bell start the game they go

01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:43.290
now I'm sorry pins for Paulie

01:28:46.469 --> 01:28:49.329
how's the real Vince propely is it Marky

01:28:49.329 --> 01:28:52.570
Mark who was the real Vince Papale E I

01:28:52.570 --> 01:28:54.280
don't know I have high hopes for the

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.320
Sixers I think the Eagles are just I

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.760
don't know they're playing and London

01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.170
this week yeah but here's the thing for

01:28:59.170 --> 01:29:00.840
the six there's too many great

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:03.340
unbelievable basketball teams they don't

01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:06.130
stand a [ __ ] chance the Sixers no I

01:29:06.130 --> 01:29:07.960
don't like your negativity wrong I'm

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:10.060
just being honest with you did I'm being

01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:12.460
[ __ ] try to protect your heart but

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:18.579
they're a great team too they're good

01:29:18.579 --> 01:29:20.079
they're cool yeah they're better than

01:29:20.079 --> 01:29:20.440
they were

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:29.739
there's fun video game team yeah I think

01:29:29.739 --> 01:29:31.210
they're good but you don't think you

01:29:31.210 --> 01:29:34.090
know they're never gonna compose the

01:29:34.090 --> 01:29:36.369
Boston this year near Boston is pretty

01:29:36.369 --> 01:29:37.810
great Boston's not even gonna come close

01:29:37.810 --> 01:29:40.659
to like go and say well yeah everybody

01:29:40.659 --> 01:29:42.340
the West is better yeah you think the

01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:43.570
Lakers are really that much better with

01:29:43.570 --> 01:29:45.670
LeBron now I don't think kind of suck

01:29:45.670 --> 01:29:48.520
right yeah they do go pick it up yeah

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.530
yeah in a series I would take the Lakers

01:29:50.530 --> 01:29:52.599
yeah all you gotta do is instigate these

01:29:52.599 --> 01:29:54.010
guys never get into a knock-down

01:29:54.010 --> 01:29:56.889
drag-out I try to watch the they had

01:29:56.889 --> 01:29:59.679
like the slow-mo was if you JFK films on

01:29:59.679 --> 01:30:01.780
like the spit coming out of his mouth

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:03.790
rado spit on you think you see that I

01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:05.650
saw him he definitely spit on and that's

01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:07.869
exactly what CP first of all is saying

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:09.460
that to him don't [ __ ] spit on me but

01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:10.480
spit

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.920

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:20.220
the back what were they like

01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:22.870
excluding cleaning yeah leaving okay I

01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:24.850
think his [ __ ] face

01:30:24.850 --> 01:30:27.610

01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:31.420
