Title: Wahlberg
Description: The winds of salt life have blown Shane over to South Carolina where he is shacking up with his close dogs. Matt is as bunkered down as ever...actually it would be crazy we died later this week. Just thought of how unflattering this would be as a final project before being taken out by our viral enemy.

Stay strong!

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.300
just recently reinvigorated by the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.130
arrival of Chris O'Connor

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.560

they've conducted themselves on my

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.020
beaches yeah it's Spring Break

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.320

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.440
totally flat like it's crazy it's like

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.870
powdery nice and not like shitty well

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.700
this was I was down by the water so I

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.340
was like just yep here it felt like you

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.770
know walking on like a street oh it's

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.310
just flat it was great yeah you start

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.990
moving a little you start I started

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.190
dancing a little I had some headphones

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.920
and I was dancing it's nice to be a

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.690
dancer these were you really why'd you

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.240
stop ah cuz it's gay and I can't do it

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.690
publicly

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.290
now you dance like nobody's watching you

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.570
got to start dancing again dude that's

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.270
from I watch this YouTube guy he was

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.920
like talking about from a shamanic

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.239
healing perspective that's the number

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.440
one question have to ask some people

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.940
have asked when did I stop dancing when

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.770
did I stop singing and when you stumble

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.209
you figure out when you stop doing those

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.440
things that's typically when bad stuff

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.530
started happening to you

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.030
yeah bad stuff will stop you from

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.180
dancing for sure yeah man I mean I my

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.580
guess ends dancing by dancing life is

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.170
very mine's very fraught with anxieties

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.920
racial barriers because when I die you

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.910
know I'm going to weddings where I'm the

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.040
minority dude and I feel like a specimen

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.990
like I have to like now you know of

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.760
course I have to everyone's expected now

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.390
you have to crush it and it is weird

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.000
though cuz dude it's like if you imagine

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.470
the other way though imagine if you were

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.780
a black guy who couldn't dance and he

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.400
went to like an all-white wedding you'd

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.750
still be better than everybody else if

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.220
it was like come on get out there now

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.370
there's right there's black doors no

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.800
there are there's actually a good amount

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.120
of black people that suck at dancing

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.520
that's actually that is confirmable

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.270
blood yeah

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.500
standard standard issue kills a

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.919
dude she's black hills is so much better

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.750
than the average white dancer at a white

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.350
wedding I was down there headphones in

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.630

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.580
black dancer on the beach the moves it

well dude this Spring Break thing that's

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:26.059
funny about that is uh I thought all

kids were like climate change activists

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.010

shootings no they purposely put them in

00:26:35.299 --> 00:26:39.309
the news and in reality they're like

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.610
always and what's funny is I I know I

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.890
knew that because I would talk

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.450
to they come to shows into

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:51.880

young people out there that are like you

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.540

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.480
like they out of the presidential cares

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.270

dude I that GI pulls back when I just

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:14.419
said that hard

00:27:14.419 --> 00:27:16.610
no no I'm pulling back because I'd want

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:19.850
to cough outside of my car no hell no

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.220

conferences about all of the kovat

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.140

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.419
quit like people were people were like

00:27:29.419 --> 00:27:30.740
yeah well you know you sound a little

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.299
too optimistic well you know you're

00:27:32.299 --> 00:27:33.500
selling people false hope if he were to

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.570
be like yeah we're did they you're

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.280
just all doom and gloom what's your

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.840
problem yeah no yeah of course of course

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.940
the fact that he was I mean when they

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.490
were when they were he was talking at

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:44.720
one reporter and he was like the

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.580
reporters like so what do you say to the

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.380
Americans were scared right now it was

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.919
like that you're a terrible reporter

00:27:50.919 --> 00:27:54.679
also that was notice genuinely yeah go

00:27:54.679 --> 00:27:57.350
ahead sorry that was like that was I was

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.330
watching that like you know trumpet

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.820
actually destroyed that reporter

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.309
oh dude that was like he totally ruined

00:28:04.309 --> 00:28:05.990
that guy yeah well I think it was

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.460
 and they still tried to switch

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.990
it like they still try to like posts

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.090
videos and it was like dramatic sad

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.809
music can be like instead of focusing on

00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:16.650
burping up Cool Ranch Doritos by the way

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.240
[Laughter]

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.530
instead of like focusing on the issues

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.690
Trump is just attacking journalists

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.000
that's not that's literally that's not

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.700
what's happening it's like like all

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.690
right what are we right about that

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.200
though he's right that a lot of them not

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.940
that not that they shouldn't be but they

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.889
should be reporting that in fact

00:28:35.889 --> 00:28:38.529
a lot of them seem to be like like so

00:28:38.529 --> 00:28:40.830
New York Times will tweet and be like

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.870
cases are up three hundred seventy

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.139
percent this week yeah and it's like

00:28:46.139 --> 00:28:49.899
yeah because tests went up five thousand

00:28:49.899 --> 00:28:51.429
percent this week yeah

00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:53.799
they don't give my only obviously cases

00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:55.000
are blowing up because that's how

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.700
viruses work but it's also like you know

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.940
can we also report like yeah testing is

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.740
also going up that's why the numbers are

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.330
skyrocketing because testing is

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.789
skyrocketing yeah well then they wear

00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:08.110
the test then they don't the tests are

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:09.730
like a we're the test like we're making

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.100
them he's like definitely make it I mean

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.419
like yeah we're we're making it

00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:15.789
oh we deleted this I still need to

00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:17.500

of all I've never not in mushrooms or

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.769
the best other they might be I don't

00:29:47.769 --> 00:29:50.110
understand invest but what the holdup is

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.230
at all they just got lumped into drugs

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.870
which they're not they got into the

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.600
wrong category there's good jugs they're

good for you there on the if you go for

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.070
the harm index they're like might be the

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:06.700
lowest really yeah in terms of like I

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.919

pounds of mushrooms before you like you

chilling at the house though no that's

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.789
true probably cool with that well

00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:13.929
they're getting a double dose of

00:33:13.929 --> 00:33:17.470
lockdown plus newborn newborns gotta be

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.030
tough for the dogs I mean they had the

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.830
best life ever before we had a baby man

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:22.419

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.309
while we were watching TV and he I just

00:33:36.309 --> 00:33:37.809
went upstairs and started wrestling him

00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:39.490
and that's all he wanted to do it he's

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:42.100
won power yeah we wrestled for a little

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.130
bit damn dude what do you think about

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.340
this apocalypse that's impending do you

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.360
think what do you think's gonna happen

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.580
here I'm going back to what I think

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.230
we're going back to work in about two

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:56.919
weeks that's with or without a vaccine I

00:33:56.919 --> 00:33:58.860
think we're going back because we're

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.900
we're not gonna risk yeah I think

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.490
they're gonna stay I think they're gonna

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.299
yeah I think you're right I think after

00:34:04.299 --> 00:34:05.679
two weeks on everything all right if you

00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:06.820
are somebody with a compromised immune

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.679
system you live with one you guys can

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.119
continue to quarantine yourself but if

00:34:10.119 --> 00:34:12.580
you want to hit it open it back up and

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.109
people are gonna open back up you know

00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:16.089
yeah they're gonna have to I've read

00:34:16.089 --> 00:34:18.909
someone actually the scientist the

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.800
unnamed scientist who does the patreon

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.800
stuff he sent me a study today saying

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.240
they're starting to figure out there's

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.690
like certain climates this disease

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.490
thrives it so there they're gonna be

00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:31.720
able to Sartre predicting it according

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.220
to weather patterns where it'll hit

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.770
harder No

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:38.500
so that's kinda guess is the climate is

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:44.230
Asian cities tow pian yeah dystopian

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.899

thinking I don't know Connie put it put

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.240
some good thoughts into my head he was

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.790
just like I mean once he said it was

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.110
like yeah it's pretty pretty I guess

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.520
common he was like it's gonna get to a

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.260
point where we're just like how many

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.150
lives are we willing to lose here in

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:27.190
order to make sure the economy doesn't

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.950
totally collapse so I'm sure we can lose

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.440
a million-plus geezers I mean dude yes

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.490
you're sending everyone back to work

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:36.850
 it ask yourself this question since

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:38.710
when did the government give a

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:43.090
about geezers dude well you know I'm

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:44.830
quoting David Icke on this but it's like

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:46.900
that's a good point he's like so you're

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.310
gonna tell me the government's gonna

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.860
sacrifice the national maybe global

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.050
economy for geezers the same people

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:54.550
they've been cutting their benefits for

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:59.800
years for come on now yeah ask yourself

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.010
that what does that indicate a little

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:05.800
more serious no yeah it does it's

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.300
basically this is a this is a new world

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.100
order stunt basically where it's like

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.170
this is gonna allow the technocrats this

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.370
is going to give the technocrats a

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.500
reason to start tracking your every move

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.600
everything on it was well they were the

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.640
reason they say the certain countries

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.130
like didn't get as sick was that they

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.870
would trace your location and then see

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:24.340
whoever was around you and then tell

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.810
that force all those other people in a

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.790
quarantine like China was able to China

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.340
will lock you in your room

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.260
there's no say go to bed a lot no though

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.630
I want to tell you it's bedtime yeah

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.840
they'll lock your apartment from outside

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.190
see those videos coming out of China I

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.300
just see the things I don't know how

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:40.790
many of those

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.740
real but it's always like them like

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.600
ripping people out of cars and

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.730
like I think they think they're getting

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.590
rowdy there was one I saw that of like a

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.110
like chain gang of sick people like they

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:54.410
were like handcuffed in a line getting

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:57.710
marched out of a town what the I

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.480
mean also we're not real there's still a

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.580
chain gang chiness like they're so doing

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.200
it all so what's really funny as China

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.450
was like China announced like this week

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:09.200
they're like no we have no new cases

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.920
this week it's like yeah sure China

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.700
funny liars

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:18.200
because why non-stop apparent I think

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.180
they said it honestly is like when Iran

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.500

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.450
in the mix so bats a Pangolin in a

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.460
penguin in a bat were probably caged

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.350
next to each other and a bat was

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:26.140
probably sucking on a penguin

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.040
foot or some

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.410
like them their disease is straight

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:32.180
animal it's an animal to get in

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.130
transmission which is apparently not

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.080
like a regular thing

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.320
no it's very irregular but yeah

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.180
everybody knew that was always gonna

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.490
come from Chinese markets did

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:47.120
you see the reason 2708 yo-yo is Oh

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.950
everyone from like oh seven there was

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:50.300
something like this is bad it's good

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:51.590
they're gonna be we're gonna get

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:52.809
something bad from

00:41:52.809 --> 00:41:55.779
I mean an exiting putting snakes

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:57.579
and bats and blenders do they're making

00:41:57.579 --> 00:42:01.539
witches brew that is a witch's brew

00:42:01.539 --> 00:42:03.519
they're like eye of Newt good it's

00:42:03.519 --> 00:42:09.609
actually a good appetizer why is it so

00:42:09.609 --> 00:42:11.880
funny

00:42:12.299 --> 00:42:17.859
it really looks funny really is is to

00:42:17.859 --> 00:42:19.809
think that like a witch's cocktail which

00:42:19.809 --> 00:42:22.539
is like yeah they're like mmm this champ

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:25.299
which potions I'm sorry Oh

00:42:25.299 --> 00:42:27.459
Connor is literally he just opened the

00:42:27.459 --> 00:42:28.779
door was like we're cooking burgers do

00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:38.529

a witch's potion but no actually this is

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:44.380
delicious no which is like he's like

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.239
Chinese guy just munching more and more

00:42:46.239 --> 00:42:51.549
of it is that salamander oh and Newt

00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:56.640
Ivan had this since Wuhan yeah that's

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.380
it's not like a moral like I don't I'm

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:02.529
not pissed it like Chinese people it's

00:43:02.529 --> 00:43:04.569
but if I'm a furious right now about a

00:43:04.569 --> 00:43:06.279
Connor doing what he just did I mean oh

00:43:06.279 --> 00:43:07.599
yeah that would I would chap my ass

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:10.599
imagine imagine if like from people not

00:43:10.599 --> 00:43:13.059
picking up their dog all of a

00:43:13.059 --> 00:43:14.679
sudden the whole world is like global

00:43:14.679 --> 00:43:16.929
pandemic people are dying and you

00:43:16.929 --> 00:43:18.659
could be like dog

00:43:18.659 --> 00:43:20.769
 with all this goddamn

00:43:20.769 --> 00:43:23.289
disease I don't know why they're trying

00:43:23.289 --> 00:43:25.390
to say that it didn't come from what's

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:26.289
the point of saying it didn't come from

00:43:26.289 --> 00:43:30.669
China the thing is these

00:43:30.669 --> 00:43:32.679
identity politics who

00:43:32.679 --> 00:43:35.459
Bank made their whole lives around this

00:43:35.459 --> 00:43:38.709
thing but being like we don't know for a

00:43:38.709 --> 00:43:40.089
fact that it came from there it's like

00:43:40.089 --> 00:43:41.829
no I think we do I think I think that's

00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:43.900
pretty actual I remember the first the

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.759
first video I saw about it it was like

00:43:45.759 --> 00:43:48.249
no it didn't come from people eating

00:43:48.249 --> 00:43:52.779
bats and then like the w-h-o was

00:43:52.779 --> 00:43:54.159
like yeah it probably came from people

00:43:54.159 --> 00:43:57.189
eating bats yeah it's like all these

00:43:57.189 --> 00:43:59.199
 like youtubers are like please

00:43:59.199 --> 00:44:01.569
stop being ignorant I'm a doctor

00:44:01.569 --> 00:44:05.069
it did not come from

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.690
would you know I'm a sports medicine a

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:09.970

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:18.040
Carioca stretch the I watched a trumped

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.990
you ever see the Trump fact checks that

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:23.590
are like from Fox it's it's literal

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:25.240
brain with billy support him where they

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.500
support them and they're just kind of

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.240
like oh so funny here's a rumor he's

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.650
like that's not true and they don't have

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:30.910
any there's no like real proof there's

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:32.410
like yeah that's not true either and oh

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:33.880
yeah by the way yeah it's not true and

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.350
also trump's doing a fantastic job and

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:37.390
you're like thanks appreciate the break

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:41.290

actually embarrassing that's my go-to

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:49.510
I turned Fox on right away I guess I

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:51.910
mean you could live in that world you

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:53.860
could decide to live in the Fox News

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.280
like that's your reality I mean dude is

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.320
different difference between CNN and Fox

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.730
News yeah I was gonna say is it that

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:02.620
different no it's not it's just them

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.110
being like you know it's very gay CNN

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:07.300
the whole time is like we're dying like

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.120
is this virus Trump's fault yes

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.220
breaking news Trump is a

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.230
breaking news Trump and munched bats

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:16.240
what if you don't actually launchpads

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.520
breaking news

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.810
[Laughter]

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:21.640
yeah I'm just I mean I I'm at the point

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.040
where I'm like god damn it I'm pissed

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.720
off people ate penguins I'm like what

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.390
the guys I'm genuinely like what

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:31.660
the but imagine if eating like crab

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.880
legs gave like everybody in Spain

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.770
dysentery I'd be like man I didn't know

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:37.840
sorry about that man I would say if I'd

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.220
be the first in line to be like sorry

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.440
about that Spain crab buggers are great

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.630
have you tried them yeah the Anglin czar

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:46.000
good if penguins hold up and they are

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.910
delicious really delicious treats they

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:50.500
probably do real delicious dude

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.680
how'd their is is do you think they are

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:58.360
okay they're probably so good if you

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:01.720
were to eat a Pangolin I would what

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.250
would you do it oh you ever saw are you

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.050
talking like is this like a hot sauce

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.420
type animal or is it like Turkey where

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.300
you mix it with gravy oh I don't know

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.590
that would you could they don't really

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.120
have bones so you couldn't really arrest

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.950
it it I mean because you could trying to

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:16.810
get money they don't have bones Pangolin

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:18.100
I think aren't they like a shell

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.369
creature

00:46:19.369 --> 00:46:21.829
I used to their bones enamel okay so

00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:23.150
yeah I'm trying to think of like we'll

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:25.880
get a sauce like maybe a little souvenir

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.200
so I'm trying to think what kind I saw

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.180
said me because I would amell's they're

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.099
just munch mammals so I would cook I

00:46:31.099 --> 00:46:33.170
would cook the Pangolin in its own shell

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:36.079
like steaming up okay

00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:37.490
you know I mean give it a little flavor

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:39.140
so I it's not like you're thinking like

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.990
armadillo it's kind of like scaled they

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:45.259
could like a scaled animal now but it

00:46:45.259 --> 00:46:48.650
has like more like kind of the gal looks

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:50.119
like a hedgehog yeah kind of looks like

00:46:50.119 --> 00:46:53.029
a armored hedgehog yeah it's pretty cool

00:46:53.029 --> 00:46:55.039
it's a cool animal what's your

00:46:55.039 --> 00:46:57.589
favorite part of the Pangolin I would

00:46:57.589 --> 00:47:04.279
say it's me I like the scales yeah you

00:47:04.279 --> 00:47:07.609
fry those scales they go now Cherokee

00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:10.849
some Pangolin chips I do like I wish I

00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:13.009
had if they're good if they're good if

00:47:13.009 --> 00:47:15.049
they're good and if bats are good a

00:47:15.049 --> 00:47:17.089
hundred percent Chinese people are off

00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:18.440
the hook for this well you know some

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.970
Vice reporters about to go eat a

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:22.249
Pangolin and I go eat tangling in a bat

00:47:22.249 --> 00:47:25.869
like they're probably doing it now today

00:47:26.799 --> 00:47:29.150
if they did it I swear to god they're

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.619
innocent

00:47:29.619 --> 00:47:34.039
what yeah the Chinese if a vice reporter

00:47:34.039 --> 00:47:36.619
no I'm saying if Pangolin tastes good

00:47:36.619 --> 00:47:38.059
and if that's tastes good

00:47:38.059 --> 00:47:41.720
the Chinese are innocent men to imagine

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.690
it medium-rare burgers caused

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:45.950
worldwide sickness you'd be like

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:47.509
sorry dude I like him like that

00:47:47.509 --> 00:47:50.720
yeah but then again I mean someone had

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.609
to have been like you can't do it like

00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:54.289
how is there not like we have the health

00:47:54.289 --> 00:47:55.970
authorities okay

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:57.589
well China I didn't have that China

00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:58.880
doesn't really have regulations on

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.739
people munching there's no munch

00:48:00.739 --> 00:48:02.900
regulations now they're setting up some

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.489
munch regulations now people like you

00:48:04.489 --> 00:48:05.930

like I stop with the dogs it's still

00:48:13.579 --> 00:48:15.680
funny would be like well we cows and

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.200

nightmare stop doing that yeah I

00:48:28.999 --> 00:48:30.920
wouldn't want to see that at all boiling

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.170
any mammal I'm not down with boiling a

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:33.590

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.170
look oh my all of our Chinese listeners

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:46.880

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.340
with you guys am i judging you I

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:51.440
literally just said a hundred percent if

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.840
penguins taste good this was kind of

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.880
worth it yeah yeah I'd say that yeah

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:58.460
like there's no judgment here trill and

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.410
as I just told me yeah like you were

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:02.030
saying like if Cool Ranch Doritos was

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.920
gonna make everybody in Spain of

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:07.310
diarrhea I wouldn't I would still mud

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:10.190
cinder eats did also imagine how much

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:11.870
more delicious I already eat now that

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:13.190
you know they could cause a global

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:15.260
pandemic when you're not allowed to eat

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.120
them it's just like jerking off right

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:22.190
now for you know how I I have I had it

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:24.530
noted I like I can't I can't I don't

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:27.770
have time to nut and like I don't know

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:30.530
when it's okay there's no good time the

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:33.770
100% the move is to pause the podcast if

yeah there was like an Asian dude with

00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.390
like a sign that was like Asian people

00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:03.760

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:07.310
everyone got sick there was a meme it

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:09.320
wasn't true there's no way that was real

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.930
there's no way that me responsible

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.030
no of course how many think he did cause

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.650
I don't know he didn't cause 4500 but

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:16.790
like how many deaths do you think the

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:19.270
hunger did he calls in over 25 to 30

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:28.130
killed 25 to 30 Italian oh yeah oh

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:29.600
 we were talking about I was like

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.160
it's funny that the country's getting

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.800
crushed harder so flops and Chinese

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:37.280
people to countries we make fun of the

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.590
boats I was on dad me trying to figure

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.090
it out and my theory is that they kiss

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:42.340
each other all the time

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.540
Italians were kids ops cheeks yeah

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:46.190
they're constantly transmitting that

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:51.530
 spreads fast this is a great

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:53.330
the bad you haven't prepared for us

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:55.540
today

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:03.540
everywhere that and China has a pretty

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.620
strong presence up there

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.710
well Silk Road action yeah I heard about

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:12.840
that yeah so really I don't know dude I

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.430
think it might have been us that caused

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:16.530
it well Jared you look into the thing

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:18.030
about the Harsanyi or reporting that it

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:19.530
was us that did it did you look into the

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.480
Harvard scientist who was on Chinese

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.220
payroll and then got boss sitting on he

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.420

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.780

dollars a month and then like they found

00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:36.870

00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:38.370
patreon was fat

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:40.410
patreon was looking at me his his

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:42.540

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.420
culture given your patreon yet it's

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:46.770

or like engineering kovat that's that's

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:09.060

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:28.010
hundred times watching him champ digital

00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:30.710

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:33.530
 dude unreal somebody stand their

00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:35.390
ground on digital graffiti and just look

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:36.590
at his screen if someone's saying like

00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:37.760
the most horrible things you can think

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.170
of and be like what the hell what the

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:40.850

the only one that's ever done that he's

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:48.740
no one capable of that I said I think

00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:50.860
he's the only person who can do that

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.780
yeah we gotta bring back digital we

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.980
should probably do it we should probably

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:58.070
figure out a way to stream yeah man that

00:58:58.070 --> 00:59:01.010
that should happen when we again your

00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:03.050
prediction is two weeks so if we have

00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:05.720
two weeks off no no no that's just gonna

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.030
be people working there we're not gonna

00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:09.890
be able to have a public gathering for

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:12.050
like six months we could stream oh yeah

00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:15.460
you need a crowd there to use like crowd

00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:18.530
it'll it'll just people will just be

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:19.910
like I don't know have you seen the

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:23.000
 uh the different projections of

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.170
like the the the the curves on the death

00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:28.910
tolls and the hospital beds and all that

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:31.760
 now so if it goes unchecked if we

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.800
just went about our lives this thing

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:34.849
would like

00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:37.069
tear through the population to be done

00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:40.249
by like August okay if we do this if we

00:59:40.249 --> 00:59:42.199
quarantine its just gonna like slowly

00:59:42.199 --> 00:59:45.679
bump up for a year this is gonna take a

00:59:45.679 --> 00:59:47.929
year and a half I don't know if I like

00:59:47.929 --> 00:59:50.179
that if we close everything it's mean

00:59:50.179 --> 00:59:51.650
it's still gonna it's gonna take like

00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:53.569
two years for this thing to so if we

00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:55.789
just purge and if we literally were like

00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:57.979
yo the party's on there just keep

00:59:57.979 --> 01:00:00.949
rolling now yeah things that's the thing

01:00:00.949 --> 01:00:02.719
that sucks about that is we we don't

01:00:02.719 --> 01:00:05.269
have any hospital beds for that have you

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:06.880
scared say at home dude

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.989
that's really mantra are you scared that

01:00:08.989 --> 01:00:11.449
they could wait instead of sending

01:00:11.449 --> 01:00:14.539
everybody a $1,200 check they can let

01:00:14.539 --> 01:00:16.819
people who aren't in a position where

01:00:16.819 --> 01:00:18.679
they're at risk to go and work and if

01:00:18.679 --> 01:00:20.539
you are little bit all right well we'll

01:00:20.539 --> 01:00:21.979
give you your blocks to stay and chill

01:00:21.979 --> 01:00:25.459
and sit on your keister I think that's

01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:28.539
how it should be done I mean the the

01:00:28.539 --> 01:00:32.119
it's either we wait for a vaccine or we

01:00:32.119 --> 01:00:33.919
let it burnin through the entire

01:00:33.919 --> 01:00:37.819
population yeah are you willing to risk

01:00:37.819 --> 01:00:42.199
the entire economy global on Jesus

01:00:42.199 --> 01:00:44.299
that's what I'm saying dude on 1% of our

01:00:44.299 --> 01:00:46.009

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.239
Harvey Weinstein all the elite geezers

01:00:56.239 --> 01:00:58.819

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.709
Washington Post has it Dan that's a

01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:23.380
weird picture of him that might've been

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:25.239

01:15:25.239 --> 01:15:29.409
skater dude it's 2017 let me say early

01:15:29.409 --> 01:15:32.949
life Wahlberg was born okay just say he

01:15:32.949 --> 01:15:34.150
had four spouses

01:15:34.150 --> 01:15:36.999
probably bro scroll up what word might

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:41.619
be the go-to no children for spouses

01:15:41.619 --> 01:15:43.179

before well you were scrolling I was

01:15:52.269 --> 01:15:53.619
like dude if he has four different wives

01:15:53.619 --> 01:15:56.380
he literally is it if he is it a wife

01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:00.159
for every hate crime I think you got a

01:16:00.159 --> 01:16:01.840
Rio every hate crime you do to get a new

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.229

01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:08.670
those uh yeah so young as nine children

01:16:08.670 --> 01:16:11.530
his dad was a delivery driver so he is

01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:13.659
of Swedish and Irish descent and his mom

01:16:13.659 --> 01:16:16.030

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:19.269
that no and his mom saw okay so Mark

01:16:19.269 --> 01:16:21.159

with it to see who watch dude I think

01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:19.479
that Dutch and the Portuguese were

01:17:19.479 --> 01:17:20.949
dropping at first you think they started

01:17:20.949 --> 01:17:21.760
it

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.140
apparently they started and Mark

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:28.720
Wahlberg finished it yeah and then at 88

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.590

okay throwing rocks at them the next day

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.340
Wahlberg and others followed a group of

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:43.989
schoolchildren taking a field trip on a

01:17:43.989 --> 01:17:46.000
beach yelling racial epithets at them

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.790
and throat they threw rocks again and he

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:49.989

01:17:49.989 --> 01:17:52.000
he said come on gals dogs and white

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.130

assaulted a middle-aged Vietnamese man

01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:32.500
call him a Vietnam and he

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.960
hit him with a large wooden stick he hit

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.610

01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:48.910
 Wahlberg down at a load large

01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:51.520
and then he attacked a second Vietnamese

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.500
man later the same day punching him in

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:56.440
the eye what he went on a tear

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.330
and then when he was arrested and

01:18:58.330 --> 01:18:59.530
returned to the scene the first assault

01:18:59.530 --> 01:19:00.940
he told police officers I'll tell you

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.530
now that that's the head I

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:04.570
split open and they noted that Wahlberg

01:19:04.570 --> 01:19:06.250
made numerous unsolicited racial

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:07.960
statements about gooks in slant-eyed

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:12.280

01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:34.199
yeah dude it's Mark Wahlberg you didn't

01:19:34.199 --> 01:19:35.190
get out there and do some other I

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:36.300
think that was when he's filming fear

01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:39.510
they're like oh come on and then he

01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:41.610
fractured his neighbor's jaw in 92 I

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.650
don't think it's a white guy so we're

01:19:43.650 --> 01:19:47.159
all good on that yeah dude

01:19:47.159 --> 01:19:50.400

just became a rap Mountain Oh six he got

01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:57.599
another Asian I think oh no no he made a

01:19:57.599 --> 01:20:00.540
man make it men's so then he he

01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:04.139
requested a pardon uh and then trend

01:20:04.139 --> 01:20:06.420
released her truck whenever a tree

01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:08.520
released a public statement forgiving he

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.070
forgave Mark Wahlberg for calling him

01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:12.480
Vietnam

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:16.770

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:18.929
 up dude a bo staff attack on a

01:20:18.929 --> 01:20:22.889
Vietnamese guy yeah you think so Choi

01:20:22.889 --> 01:20:23.969
you think he at least flipped it around

01:20:23.969 --> 01:20:27.449
real cool like definitely if I know Mark

01:20:27.449 --> 01:20:30.030
Wahlberg I did so I'm cool with that bow

01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:31.949
stuff I love about all of his movies are

01:20:31.949 --> 01:20:34.260
like stopping about like the Boston

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.500
Marathon bomber this is the bad guy yeah

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.380
he's just a bad guy dude this is

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.150
out beating the out of innocent

01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:44.820
people he wasn't a there was the

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:47.489
eighties Bros a different time true I

01:20:47.489 --> 01:20:49.409
mean yeah I can't say that I mean I was

01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:51.599
grown he's became it first of all he's

01:20:51.599 --> 01:20:54.060
become a millionaire ever since so I'm

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.310
sure grown and matured he didn't know I

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:58.230
think he did I think yeah I don't know

01:20:58.230 --> 01:20:59.489
though you think there's part of him you

01:20:59.489 --> 01:21:01.320
think if he sees a large wooden stick on

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:02.730
the ground he's in Chinatown he might

01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:06.719
have to big mark don't do it mock da I

01:21:06.719 --> 01:21:08.219
got he's gotta call Donnie guys like

01:21:08.219 --> 01:21:10.230
mock don't do it it was a mess last time

01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:12.119
you kiss Lee put the stick down he's a

01:21:12.119 --> 01:21:13.949

01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:22.170
he make it through this how did he I

01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:24.090
guess there's a grandfathered in if you

01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:26.010
beat the out of Asians or threw

01:21:26.010 --> 01:21:27.900
