marathon they're saying now that they

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.889
can take a small DNA sample and then

00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:48.420
construct what they think you're like a

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.949
pretty accurate portrayal of what your

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:53.670

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.980
yeah reading their quotes is like it's

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.600
crazy that's pretty funny it's just

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.150
crazy it's like this like they're like

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.490
as a POC and like a comedy clubs are

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.309
like it's like - shut the [ __ ] up shut

00:23:41.309 --> 00:23:43.230
up and then they were talking about us

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.630
and particularly me being like I could

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.090
tell he believed what he said like

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.770
they're saying that like he be it'd be

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.900
different but he you could tell he

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.970
believed what he was saying he is racist

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.130
it's like see what the [ __ ] are you

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:56.940
talking about

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.250
I just defend it today I was talking

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.610
about [ __ ] you saying Chinese food is

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.770
a dishonest cuisine yeah I'm like dude

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.919
that's not a real statement no I mean

00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:10.830
even if it's even if he's believes that

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.480
like a tit

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.040
at the core of like its nutritional

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.530
value isn't real that's what you're

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:19.950
saying but it's funny too it's almost

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.510
like making fun of my cousin for her

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.610
shitty cake yeah it's like you're

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.650
getting you're out outwardly getting

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.510
upset and saying a ridiculous statement

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.750
because it's funny to pretend to be

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.220
upset about something so dumb but you

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.890
also do it it's like a test is it even

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.900
question the honesty of a cuisine is

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.000
like yeah and to say cuisine and

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.910
dishonest cuisine a dishonest cuisine

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.380
and they're like but what's funny about

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.390
that are like what does he mean by that

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:47.430
yeah dude he means [ __ ] nothing by

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:50.250
that yeah I'm like listen to the [ __ ] I

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:51.660
know we're still talking about the clip

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.340
obviously I know but it's like dude a

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.770
minute later I say get these ducks out

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.320
of the window and people were like he's

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.910
serious of course you mean that dude of

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.890
course I go down to Chinatown and I get

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.470
pissed off again like what the [ __ ] just

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.570
the fact but anyway there's a panel of

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.210
people in Toronto and they passed you're

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.980
sitting in a room saying we believed

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.750
what we said we believed it they can

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.360
tell from that clip we are racist and we

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.470
believe it yes that's nice and I was I

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.060
was talking with O'Connor about it and

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.470
how funny it is that the whole thing is

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.330
predicated on the fact that we are

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.150
serious yeah otherwise they can't they

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:30.030
don't exist like they need people like

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.580
us to be real their texts they need us

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.160
to be real because if we're not real if

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.390
it's like oh they're just [ __ ] around

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:37.980
then they can't have their little

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.260
committee yeah they can't sit in the

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.430
room and be like these are problems

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.350
we're facing it's like no that's not a

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.520
real problem so we don't need this

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.260
committee well you don't need to do this

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.820
you guys can go back to like try and go

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.380
back to me or whatever be in like

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.070
getting not in two clubs not because

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.920
clubs are rooted in white supremacy but

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.300
because you're not getting laughs

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.120
because you buy what the [ __ ] it's as

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.650
clear as that though it's like even like

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.420
because I'm dude I thought about this at

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.550
length I'm like I remember going to open

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.590
mics and then like those weird clicky

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.020
open mics would be like oh here's a

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:10.830
friend of the room

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.360
hilarious [ __ ] comic and then people

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.250
will be like wow like making themselves

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.950
last laugh in the backwards huh-huh

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.080
making themselves sorry fine if you

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.000
can't make it yourself flat making

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.170
themselves laughing hard and then it's

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.210
like that I can see how people think

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:25.980
that's crazy people be like well maybe

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.299
they just were laughing it's like yeah

00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:28.500
I've thought about that but then they

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.299
would go to an actual comedy club and

00:26:30.299 --> 00:26:33.090
all bomb yeah in front of an actual

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:34.980
audience that wasn't their friends yeah

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.590
that's a pretty clear indicator and then

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.660
of people like loses I mean there is a

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.520
case to be made for certain comedy clubs

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.110
sure not liking a black people's uh but

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.630
anyway oh dude no earlier on in the

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:50.160
Philly comedy scene there was there were

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.510
some prominent clubs that were just like

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.880
oh oh you mean clubs wouldn't booked

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.260
them I was gonna say audiences loved

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.870
black audience white audiences loved

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.250
black owned and nuts through black

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.040
comics loved them most of the time they

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.140
it's yeah I've never seen it's the same

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.850
way like if a decent white comic does a

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:06.450
black room

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:07.950
you could murder and I've had black

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.990
comics be like he's just crushing

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.970
because he's white yes I've had that

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.530
because I've done a lot of black rooms

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.480
and I always had a win it to I had to

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.919
like win them it took me like a couple

00:27:16.919 --> 00:27:18.330
minutes yeah it's like you're fighting

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.340
oh it's like you versed Instagram for

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.140
the first three minutes and then you'll

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.460
get a couple people laughing then else

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.530
when people pull the phones a lot of

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.630
times there's like a law or just eating

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.150
dinner which is most clubs true yes just

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:31.799
chilling and though they'll be quick to

00:27:31.799 --> 00:27:33.120
go back to dinner if that first joke

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.480
misses but it's it's funny you come out

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.710
in the first one kind of lands and

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.480
people okay and they start laughing and

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.890
then like people stop what they're doing

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.299
and kind of start like people will like

00:27:42.299 --> 00:27:43.740
start paying attention sky nice when

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.600
people there's always an ambassador in

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.669
the audience who's like oh [ __ ] they

00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:51.120

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.580
then go to Justin Trudeau yeah you know

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.260
what I'm thinking about start a mule

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.230
farm and then really advocating for

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.120
reparations what you talking about

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.070
getting a mule farm going you're gonna

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.270
get going yourself I'm gonna start

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:23.700
getting mules stockpiling moles and then

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.320
campaigning hard I'm just gonna lobby

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.290
hard as [ __ ] for the reparations and

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:30.490
then the government has to buy all my

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:35.950
mules for the reparations dude mules on

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:38.260
the docket still I think 40 acres and a

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.110
mule I think it's still on the docket

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.370
dude that would be which would be a

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.550
really hilarious like people demanding

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.890
reparations back all right fine

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.420

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.840
Everglades [ __ ] mule or you find out

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.460

you're like I need a favor bro yeah that

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.780
would be pretty tight to plan on like

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.490
[ __ ] cashing in on reparations would

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.380

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:27.160
mules yeah I mean you can't stockpile

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.440

of just the corniest [ __ ] on earth TI

00:40:27.369 --> 00:40:31.290
apologizes to his daughter over -

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.079
imagine having to publicly apologize to

00:40:35.079 --> 00:40:37.270
your daughter about her [ __ ] yes you

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.819

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:48.190
even that's uncomfortable at the dinner

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.440
table t I was probably in the cypher did

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.920

apologize to my daughter's [ __ ]

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.730
I checked it I love how this like people

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.920
also ask how do you check if the hymen

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.819
is broken or not it's like yo bro

00:41:08.819 --> 00:41:10.930
whatever that's a [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:12.339
that's what I heard that was from the

00:41:12.339 --> 00:41:13.900
rumor mill I heard that he was just he

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.839
was horsing horsing around dude he was

00:41:16.839 --> 00:41:18.579
just saying I was horsing that's a funny

00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:21.040
joke basically saying like I will go

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.780
there myself make sure that shits intact

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.960
which makes more sense that makes a lot

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.170
more sense than him physically hiring a

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.030
gynecologist to check for just going

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:32.950
with them being like I'm going with you

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:36.490
allowed to do that dude you're talking

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:38.349
about T I drove Michael Jackson could

00:41:38.349 --> 00:41:40.180
get sleeping medication shot into his

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.280
arm at night by a doctor T I can see his

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.700
daughter's [ __ ] legally true or just at

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.230
least like a paper towel and a blotter

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.440
no how do you do that

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.880
they I think you have more technology

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.680
than paper towels like an x-ray of the

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.160
hymen

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:58.269

00:41:58.269 --> 00:42:01.990
thing looks like I think it doctor looks

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:04.299
analytically bullfrogs throat I think so
