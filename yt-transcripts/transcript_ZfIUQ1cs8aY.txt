00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.439
they wanted to be there adam ferrara

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.520

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.840
not kevin james kevin james's brother

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.520
yeah gary valencia gary valentine i

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.360
don't know either of them yeah but

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.200
although adam ferrara we were like gave

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.439
him a second try and he was even worse

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.320
but yet on kelly he was great he i was

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.920

list but you were great today i i don't

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.920

if you're a comedian who's like you know

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.640

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.479

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.840
bit more less like a year and a half ago

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.640
right

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.519
things were going pretty good yeah so i

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.040
don't know if i'm doing as well as i was

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.040
but you came back strong with those

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.120
those videos and stuff i mean it's about

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.720
people who took the pandemic and made

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.480
something out of it that really came

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.160
through yeah i mean i didn't i didn't

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.920
stop doing the road so like guys like

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.480
voss just sat around like oh we can't go

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.920
outside

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.400
i just i just kept you know i kept doing

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.560
it i figured that's what was annoying i

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.680
got on the flight down here and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.599
everybody's flying again so i was like

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.159
oh it sucks again travel sucks again it

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.080
was great i am i can't even remember

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.599
last time i was on a plane and for what

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.159
reason i know i tried to go my wife was

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.760
going out of town at the end of this

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.120
month so i thought me and my son would

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.040
do something cool he doesn't want to do

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.080
it he doesn't want to hang out with me

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.599
so now i can't even think of anything to

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.800
do so

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.799
uh all right let's start with the i have

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.159
to get the saturday live stuff out of

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.280
the way we're gonna start with that so

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.080
shane

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.159
i i'm gonna be honest

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.519
when you got it i only knew of you i

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.879
knew your name i had never had you on

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.040
the show or the podcast or anything but

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.280
all my friends that are comedians were

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.720
so happy

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.319
probably secretly jealous and hating you

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.959
inside but so because you they were like

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.879
couldn't believe that you got it but

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.799
we're so happy and felt that you deserve

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.599
to get it and uh

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.439
so who did so how many did you go give

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.040
us like the audition story do you have

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.560
to do whatever these other people say

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.319
that three characters and all that stuff

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.080
uh no i don't know they must have

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.519
changed it because

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.439
for be for stand-up comedians you only

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:04.879
have to do stand-up oh really i didn't

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.799
have to i didn't have to do characters

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.959
and who is the audience like is it five

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.720
people or is there a bunch of people

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.159
it's brutal we were just talking about

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.560
that on the car i know it's like uh you

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.760
get into the

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.359
because i my whole life i was like i'm

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.000
not going to do snl right why see in my

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.359
i still think i'm going to do it and i

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.079
know

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.000
the reality is there's zero chance but

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.120
since i was a kid i was like i'm going

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.120
to be i'm going to hope for you

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.720
all right i will say that yeah growing

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.400
up i was like i'm gonna do it okay and

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.600
then once you get into comedy you're

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.600
like i'm never gonna do that

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.440
and then uh all of a sudden they were

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.880
like they had interest in me and i was

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.240
like oh man maybe this is gonna happen

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.919
but even up until the audition i was

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.680
like this isn't gonna happen right so i

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.280
was in the in are you kind of like a

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.800
kicker who has to kick an 80 yard field

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.759
goal you're like i'm probably not going

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:46.960
to make it so

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.280
yeah yeah and then uh

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.600
i wasn't that nervous which helped

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.120
because everybody else there was like an

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.280
improv guy that was like oh my god this

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.880
is it was there anybody there we would

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.360
know that you saw um that i auditioned

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.440

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.039
you know contemporaries or some names

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.479
that we might know no i don't think so

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.039
yeah okay i don't think so um but they

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.240
were you know they were nervous because

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.600
you all hang out you have to wait for

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.440
like three hours before you go on right

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.800
for the audition they do that to mess

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.560
with you they do that to like see how

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.639
you handle pressure and all that and uh

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.720

but it was like it was definitely bad i

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.600
thought i did bad right and then do you

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.080
hear anybody laugh yeah you do you hear

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.680
laura michaels

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.039
that's a pretty distinct laugh i was

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:22.800
looking for him and then he did laugh a

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.840
couple times and i was like all right

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.600
that's nice because they always say they

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.800
tell you he doesn't laugh don't be

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.400
offended but then you hear him laugh and

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.160
you're like oh okay i must be the best

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.840
ever

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.520
but then i got done i was like wow that

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.840
was bad i did bad were you able to hear

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.120
any of the other

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.400
people that were trying out oh no you

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.280
gotta wait can't even tell if you're

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.199
uh and then i ran into michael che that

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.759
night at a show and he was like

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.280
you did great i was like oh i was so

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.560
nervous and he was like you were the

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.120
least nervous oh all right maybe i got a

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.880
chance here yeah and then a couple days

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.840
later i was like oh no i'm getting it

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.199
together yeah

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.599
you went through the phases yeah

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:02.720
and then uh yeah they do like a they do

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.319
vet you they check you out they like go

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:05.680
through all your social media they do

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.039
all that before they announce that

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:08.960
you're on the show right for exactly my

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.960
reason right but i think i was one of

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.199
the first few people that had a podcast

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.280
that got it uh so they never went to

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.960
like listen to old episodes listen to a

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.560
whole podcast yeah

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.680
and and now they probably do yeah

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.479
you changed the way you said it

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.880
yeah yeah yeah so uh

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.160
now i don't put too much of your

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.520
business out there but they you were

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.440
signed to do it did you actually sign

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.039
con show that and then they had to tell

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:34.080
you no

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.599
yeah and they paid you though didn't

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:38.000
they they paid you yeah yeah half of it

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.960
uh

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.199
well technically i i got paid my first

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:43.120
contract yeah oh you got the whole yeah

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.199
yeah oh wow good for you yeah

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:47.039
yeah yeah yeah yeah that worked out

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:48.639
that's so fun um

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.080
do you think

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.840
now how do they break it to you how do

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.280
they okay well explain what did they

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.319
find

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.080
i i i was i know what it was but they

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.800
found it they say it on the radio well

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.919
uh they they found you doing comedy

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:04.960
where you made some sort of uh asian

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.360
reference yeah uh

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.520
yeah that was it i mean we were doing i

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.360
remember seeing it or hearing at the

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.800
time and i was like oh i mean that

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.960
wasn't that yeah yeah that's what i

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.720
thought too i go are they mad at him

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.720
because he's doing an asian character

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.319
are they mad at him for what he's saying

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:22.319
yeah because either way i'm like

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:24.400
hasn't everybody done that yeah what i

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.639
mean and andy's a comedian he's trying

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:29.199
to be funny and do stuff like

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.879
i didn't i didn't think it was that bad

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:32.240
i didn't think it was like oh this guy's

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.519
got to be fired immediately you know

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:34.719
what i mean it was one of those ones

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:35.680
where i go

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.000
it's a little ticky tack for me sure

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.760
sure yeah and it was again it was a time

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.120
we're doing a podcast me and my friend

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.039
are open mikers in philadelphia just

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.760
doing a podcast for like 500 people yeah

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.399
who cares yeah and then uh yeah it turns

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:50.480
out everyone cares

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.480
about a wider world

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.120
so so how do you how do you find out who

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.279
tells the bad news um

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:59.040
that was

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.480
i talked to lauren throughout the whole

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.480
thing oh yeah okay yeah yeah he's he's

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.560
actually pretty cool yeah i bet yeah or

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.760
he fakes it

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.200
either way he's cool

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.560
uh

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.720
and then yeah he was they were trying

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.600
they were trying they were like

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.200
hopefully this works and then eventually

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.240
it got to the point where they were like

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.519
this it was somebody from above yeah

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:19.600
that's okay so it's not like

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.600
i mean we always we always say this is

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.279
you find out the people who are most mad

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:25.920
at a black joke or old fat white ladies

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.560
like never so who was the one getting so

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.800
mad you know i think i think it was just

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.040
enough i think all these these companies

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.399
and shows and all these networks and

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:37.440
stuff they respond to just twitter yeah

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.040
you know there was enough noise on there

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.440
where like sponsors started to get like

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.440
and then also you know it's like a it's

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.440
a team rationale is like a team and then

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.880
you're bringing in this new guy who's

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.720
like gonna be a cancer to the locker

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.440
room yeah this could be a risk so i i

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.120
get it i get it do you remember you're

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.640
probably too young for this but howard

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.720
stern when when he was just on like in

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.240
new york in l.a and philly and all those

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.040
things he uh it was probably in the 80s

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.640
late 80s i was because i was still in

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.600
high school

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.519

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:07.600
he was on the phil donahue show do you

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.200

springer but not like oprah was

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.040
somewhere in the middle of that yeah and

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.760
uh he howard was there was an asian

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.360
group that was mad at him because he was

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.519
mocking asian people so howard was on

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.600
the show and there were two guys from

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.200
the asian group on there

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.279
and they were like yelling at him almost

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:31.360
like a character like you make up fun uh

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.040
you know they don't know yeah and and

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.360
that was funny dude it was funny it's

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.640
funny while they were mad but then

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.079
howard at the end

00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:40.320
was like uh look at me he's like that's

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.839

he was like kissed a guy and then at the

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.600
end they all end up hugging and

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.000
high-fiving and that's how it used to be

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.760
done you know somebody says something

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.279

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:52.640
i didn't mean to make you mad i'm and

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.000
then we're all high-fiving and walking

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.920
away and you have a full saturday live

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.560
career yeah uh would you have been mad

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.800
at elon musk's hosting this week i'd be

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.160
living

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.640
because i if i worked for snl i would

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.959
only work for my favorite millionaires

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.480
when even a greater portion of the one

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.200
percent show then i'd be outraged

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.800
do you know anybody on the show now

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.279
besides shay like that you talked to uh

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:21.600
yeah i know yeah like pete davidson yeah

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.839
yeah yeah i know that uh i know i'm a

00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:25.760
little yeah i'm just saying like who i'm

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.600
trying to think of who

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.519
or for what reason people would be mad

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.279
that elon musk was holding like nobody

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:33.200
can explain that to me well a lot of the

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.440
cash a lot of the people there are like

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.600
uh they believe they're they're very

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.600
political so it's like

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.000
they're like ultra left-wing

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.600
participants

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.720
i think they were upset he said

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.480
something about masks i don't know yeah

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.320
oh for the love yeah

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.160
uh anyway so it might have worked out

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.600
better for you that you weren't

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.639
maybe

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:54.480
i mean let's be honest i tweeted out a

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.800
thing the other day i love jay and i

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.720
love yeah colin jost i think that

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.720
they're i could watch clips of their

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.079
weekend update when they two of them

yeah and uh i saw che do stand up a

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.279
bunch of times i think he's a funny guy

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:09.440
yeah he's awesome and uh other than them

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.399
though

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:12.240
i haven't been drawn to saturday night

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.480

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.760
goes in waves i'm not saying that it

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.120
should be canceled or anything but i

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.880
haven't been drawn to it so stop

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.240
complaining it's the most pressed

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.079
they've gotten for anything yeah and

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:23.440
unless this was something that they

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.519
planned they don't do that which i doubt

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:28.880
but anyway so so you uh

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.880
are still hot doing comedy you're like

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.120
hey i got all this money i'm i'm still

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.800
working on my comments so do you feel

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.399
defeated or you feel like you know what

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:37.440
it's the bump in the road because you

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.639
seem like a pretty

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:41.200
take it easy yeah but you know also it's

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.720
not that much money

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.200
i would have to assume let me guess you

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.240
know

thirty-three four oh four months you're

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.760
not even considering anything seriously

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.920
you doing on on a regular basis it's

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.680
called matt and shane's secret podcast

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.160
right that's the one i got fired for you

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.760
i'm still doing still doing the same one

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.680
you're like yeah well yeah back to this

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.519
now are you worried about doing things

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:17.040
now for the future

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.680
uh something like worried about like

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.519
like repercussions of something you're

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:22.959
saying like we have to be careful

00:15:22.959 --> 00:15:25.600
because we have the fcc we have this

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.040
corporate company that we're working for

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.560
and we have sponsors on so we have to

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.600
find that

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.519
fine line but you're like i'm on a

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:33.279
podcast i don't have to answer anybody

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:34.720
yeah you still do whatever you want yeah

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.920
you can definitely say whatever you want

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.759
but it's also yeah there's definitely

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:39.120
future opportunities so you don't want

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.639
to do that and then it is in your head

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:42.480
where you're like oh man don't like

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.000
watch out

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.839
but there's also i don't think i can get

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:47.120
i don't know we'll see i might get

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:47.920
killed

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.199
i might get canceled twice that'd be

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:51.040
pretty good i don't know it's really

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.880
weird because uh

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.800
people say oh they're cancelling this

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.199
guy but yet we'll we'll still go see it

00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:00.079
we'll still do so it's really weird um i

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:01.920
i have to tell you that uh

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.720
that legion of skanks uh presidency

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.680
episode

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.759
with the dosing and all that who is here

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:10.240
that we talked to oh lewis was here yeah

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.040
yeah yeah

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.079
uh lewis was here

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.240
it's so funny i can i sat down with

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.399
lewis for an hour and talked to him and

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:19.600
we were like hey man good this is a good

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.440
time thank you and i know he left the

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.759
car and he was like i hate that guy

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:25.519
not really i just feel like it's deep in

00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:27.279
his heart louis puts that energy out

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:29.759
he's just a great guy though

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:32.399
it's so funny because everybody

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:34.399
says that about lewis yeah they're like

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:36.639
even bobby bobby's like he's such a he's

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:38.320
the sweetest generous guy and i'm like i

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.079
know but all he does is yell at me so i

00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:41.759
don't see that don't you guys fight a

00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:42.560
lot

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.560
yeah but it's almost like like i the

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.920
truth is is that

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.839
we fought pretty hard

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:49.199
and screaming at each other and really

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:50.639
getting personal with insults and all

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:53.199
that stuff but i don't i didn't wasn't

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:55.040
really mad at it afterwards and i don't

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.720
think he cared enough to be mad so when

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.920
they were like hey lewis is coming down

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.040
i was like great have him on the show i

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.759
don't know

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:01.519
and worse comes worse we start screaming

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:02.720
at each other in the studio that'd be

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.880
the best thing ever and plus bobby's

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.760
