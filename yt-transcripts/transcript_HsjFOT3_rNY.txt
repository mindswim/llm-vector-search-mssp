00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.740
historians are racist here's the thing

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.440
even if without a dump

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.590
yeah well most of them are from history

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.120
up until like last year they're racist

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.420
alright Thomas Francis Maher he was born

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.200
in 1823 alright now what I like to do

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.300
when I'm looking at history it helps me

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.020
a lot

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.850
depend like there's certain subjects I

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.830
can't study well because I heard like

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.150
learn about because I don't understand

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.860
the context of what's going on like

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.500
1820s it's a weird time like after the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.000
American Revolution to the Civil War I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.320
mean I have no idea what the [ __ ]

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.880
happened right I don't think much did

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.540
you know right in America yeah kind of

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.010
but but just in the way like the rest of

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.209
the world the rest of the world was like

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.410
the French Revolution and the Napoleonic

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.340
Wars like crazy [ __ ] Russian revoluta

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.590
but know what's in America like that's

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.630
like a small feeble power that was like

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.580
floating around [ __ ] up all the time

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.040
on the season early 1800s they were

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.400
you're thinking of the Barbary States

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.800
[ __ ] us yeah like North Africa was

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.930
that that have been around then like

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.880
Jefferson I think was the president yeah

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.470
during that just getting crushed me a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.750
small tiny little fleet and then we beat

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.370
that was before that what was no those

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.070
that was after we beat England and then

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.570
became a country so it would have been

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.820
after

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.650
so 1823 like it's always important I

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.730
think when you're looking at history to

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.080
try to figure out like what the [ __ ]

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.450
going on in the world when you're

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.100
looking at something so 1823 when this

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.900
guy was born it's like right at the end

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.019
of the Industrial Revolution so like at

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.510
this point most you know countries

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.800
especially like the United States and

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.290
England are like factories shitty

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.410
factories like childlike horrible chalk

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.150
applause [ __ ] like that like you know

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.450
because like unions and all that [ __ ]

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.280
came out of the Industrial Revolution

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.660
like because people didn't know how to

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.340
[ __ ] I thought it was gonna like

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.049
working on a farm yeah like that's how

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.730
they handled workers forever

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.680
yeah like kids can do it [ __ ] anybody

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.580
if you're outside [ __ ] machines and

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.739
[ __ ] and you're just like just throwing

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.580
people at it's just getting swallowed

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.360
only

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.860
make so much money and then you had a

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.449
machine you're like it's got a throw

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.699
porch many more hours we put on this

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.530
machine the more money we can make sense

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.219
yeah so at 18 23 just to give you some

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:38.990
context England controls most of the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.340
world this is basically like the height

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.680
of the British Empire mm-hmm so this is

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.750
after the Napoleonic Wars they just

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.699
ended like decade ago so France was the

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.620
continental European power for years

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.319
centuries now they've kind of [ __ ] up

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.759
I mean they're still very powerful but

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.560
there's like at this time there's still

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.449
weird countries it's like [ __ ] Prussia

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.060
Germany's not a country yet Italy is not

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.439
a country yet you've got Prussia the

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.860
Austrian Empire Ottoman Empire wild [ __ ]

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.069
what yeah yeah yeah the Germany would

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.599
started after us Germany and Italy yeah

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.229
they're all yeah it's funny I wrote

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.770
these notes so it was Rome then Rome art

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.349
of the papal States stuff like that yeah

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.919
yeah Italy was a bunch of states same

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.330
with Germany but they were all kind of

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.159
and then they united basically he has

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.860
like the Ottoman Empire there they're

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.659
going hard Ottoman Empire is strong

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.520
they're strong up until like World War

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.949
one so I'm and they're just but [ __ ]

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.719
the Greeks a bunch of stoves just

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.089
killing stoves what are the Ottomans

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:53.479
look like Turks okay yeah the Ottoman

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.610
Empire was like a caliphate kind of what

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.180
Isis was going for this was another

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.889
caliphate France in 1823 is invading

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.069
Spain so Spain during right after the

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:09.259
Napoleonic Wars got rid of their monarch

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.629
they had like a republic the Spanish

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.509
Republic going for a minute France comes

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.379
back in and invade Spain so during this

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.110
time while Spain France goes back in to

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.939
invade Spain to restore the monarch I

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:24.169
think his name was like Ferdinand or

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:24.560
something

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.339
and this gives the time for like all of

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:32.659
Central America to declare independence

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.110
South America this is why because Spain

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.930
was busy getting butt-fucked

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.910
this is the same time Simon Bolivar

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.270
Bolivar he's named president of Peru

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.640
so this is like 1821 Mexico's

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.470
independent Brazil declares its

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.990
independence from Portugal shits gone

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.810
this is the same year 1823 Joseph Smith

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.560
the founder of being Mormon mm-hmm he's

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.470
up in Manchester New York finding golden

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.560
tablets that an angel showed him and

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.610
that angel was like you better not

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.050
[ __ ] show anybody these golden

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.630
tablets but only you can read God's Word

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.570
if he put the tablets in your magic hat

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.480
and then Mormons exist newspapers right

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.310
yeah Stan the newspapers hasn't been

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.650
[ __ ] holy [ __ ] you this guy's talking

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.500
to angels this is wild that's [ __ ]

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:21.920
crazy

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.840
yeah apparently there was like a [ __ ]

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.670
ton of newspapers were like blogs back

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.380
apparently there was a [ __ ] I better

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.210
and I don't like the [ __ ] we have now I

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.480
don't think they were bad they're all in

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.630
different languages of [ __ ]

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.970
18:23 is rumored to be when rugby was

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.670
invented which was basically just a

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.200
[ __ ] guy that kept picking up the

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.910
ball and running during soccer matches

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.170
seriously that's out rugby like a guy

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.090
Kevin during soccer games picking it up

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.140
and running and people would have to

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:58.370
tackle this is pretty fun now the United

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.990
States at this time there's not too much

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.720
going on but this 18:23 was when the

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.090
Monroe Doctrine got signed if you don't

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.830
know what that is that's because all

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.820
these countries declared their

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.370
independence the Monroe Doctrine was

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.990
saying that if any European countries

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.970
tried to recolonize any of these Central

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.220
America South American countries it

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.900
would be an act considered an act of war

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.970
against the United States damn pretty

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.190
chill of us yeah pretty chill of us to

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.320
be like yo you guys are working hard for

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.840
independence we're gonna protect you

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.280
that was one we're super idealistic to

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.070
well slightly yeah I mean it's also a

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.990
way to keep European powers in check

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.940
yeah and then kind of us just be like

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.260
yeah we'll help you out once you take

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.030
out some loans what a good move by us

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.560
yeah also that year the Anglo Ashanti

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.940
Wars a lot of people don't know about

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.680
that it's just a British auntie yeah

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.380
Sean there's basically the British

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.310
fighting murdering

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.010
what's funny if you look up 18:23 not

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.570
too much happen or like famous people

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.839
were born 1823 Phineas Gage got that the

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:04.550
head injury yeah oh yeah you know about

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.380
him from psychology don't you NES gage

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.360
talked about Phineas Gage he's gage the

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.980
railroad railroad worker who got a

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.779
railroad tie went right through his

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:13.399
frontal lobe like some part of his

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:16.399
frontal lobe and then he survived it but

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:17.540
then they noticed like this guy is

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.790
totally [ __ ] different now so that

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.050
was when we started learning about like

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.180
the parts of the Buried frontal cortex

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.440
and everything yeah Labine like whoa if

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.480
you get hit here it's like he started

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.180
gambling cursing yeah he's like lack of

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.600
judgment was just gone whoa our

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.640
executive er executive functioning comes

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.709
from the front part of our brain and it

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:38.209
can't work simultaneously with like the

00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:39.620
rear part so the stronger you the front

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.209
part the more the rear part quiets down

00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:43.430
the rear park it's activated takes away

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.589
from the prefrontal cortex stuff it took

00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:47.450
a [ __ ] spike through the head that's

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.160
how we learn that's how we they took a

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.480
guy getting that in his head and we're

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.630
like I think that [ __ ] him up if you

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.770
look him up it's hilarious it's like

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.650
Phineas Gage noted head injury survivor

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:02.600
all right well that's what yeah that's

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.709
one of those arguments for you're like

00:10:03.709 --> 00:10:05.420
we have what if you go to heaven who

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.400
goes to heaven which Phineas Gage goes

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.800
to heaven you know mm-hmm which Phineas

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.010
Gage is in the afterlife the gambling

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.750
[ __ ] drug addict guy or the one who

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.750
had a full brain pretty trauma yeah

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.370
probably sucks pretty bad honestly I

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.570
don't think he was like that awesome but

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:26.779
he definitely I'm sure he was a [ __ ]

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:32.480
dirty [ __ ] all right so that's

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.370
what's going on 18:23 that's what's

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.510
going on oh yeah that's a good that

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.220
gives you a good idea of Europe's a

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.589
[ __ ] bunch of [ __ ] monarchs all

00:10:39.589 --> 00:10:40.940
that [ __ ]

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.860
post french revolution they're still

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.959
kind of they're getting their [ __ ] back

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:46.370
together but right now England

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.440
controls everything mm-hmm this is where

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.829
like the term the Sun never sets in the

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:52.490
British Empire

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.140
because literally the Sun never set on

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.880
land they controlled [ __ ] figured the

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.410
status they controlled like one fourth

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.940
it's insane

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.500
she's crazy right the amount of land

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.100
they controlled so now what I'd like to

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.050
do to get into this with Thomas

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.930
more is to try to figure out like it's

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.250
funny to look up Irish anti-irish

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.839
sentiment mm-hmm because it's ancient

00:11:14.839 --> 00:11:16.910
it's from day one it's not just the

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.279
British like the Romans that tried to

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:22.130
they went into England like you know

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.360
they built like Hadrian's Wall in

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.800
knowledge and they were just like we're

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.140
not wasting our time with that that

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.839
Island people over immediately got

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:31.970
killed by [ __ ] guy they're like we

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.100
don't even need we don't need to even go

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.180
to Ireland the first this is pretty

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.690
funny the first record of like anything

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.910
about Ireland is just anti I or

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.709
sentiment it comes from the Greek

00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:49.100
geographer and philosopher Strabo in his

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.800
work in his work geographica which was

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.829
published in 20 BC what yeah yeah yeah

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:57.220
20 BC he was writing about the the Irish

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.040
Chris yeah don't you read this quote for

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.890
me Chris B Straub oh right there at the

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.899
top it's gonna be a tough read mmm

00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:08.690
besides some small islands round about

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.490
Britain there's also a large island

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.370
learn which stretches parallel to

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.050
Britain on the north its breath being

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.850
greater than its length concerning this

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.500
island I have nothing certain to tell

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.480
except that its inhabitants are more

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.730
savage than the Britons since they are

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.510
man-eaters as well as heavy eaters

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.310
since further they counted an honorable

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.709
thing when their fathers died to devour

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.290
them and openly to have intercourse not

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:34.820
only with other women but also with

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.779
their mothers and sisters yes a 20 BC

00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:40.760
Strava was like alright they eat their

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:52.510
dad's [ __ ] the heavy eaters but there

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.490
have you the oceans when their dads die

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.380
they eat them and then they [ __ ] their

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.970
mind yeah don't count calories yeah

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.890
they're kind of they're not watching

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.990
their steps they're not watching their

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.380
steps also he gets to their fat before

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.089
he's like yeah they also are they have

00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:13.220
sex everywhere and they also [ __ ] their

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:18.079
moms and sisters so not funny is like I

00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:18.700
don't know

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.180
to say look I don't know him that well

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.760
but I will tell you this they're in

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:31.990
sexual fat [ __ ] dick hey so this is a

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.490
lot of this will be out of order I was

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:37.570
just taking notes in 11:55 all right so

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:38.680
now we're fat we fast forward a

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.700
millennium here okay

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.780
11:55 Pope Adrian the fourth so that's

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.640
the thing England and Ireland was

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.250
Catholic obviously so was England so

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.430
England it was against the Pope's the

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.940
law to invade mm-hmm

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.670
until Pope Adrian who was English he's

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.340
the only English Pope ever so they got

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.380
an English Pope in office and he was

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:07.270
instantly like yes Island is des so he

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.570
said he called the Pope called it a rude

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.090
and barbarous nation it was like yeah go

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:18.040
control it then I really good

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.080
note-taking here this [ __ ] went on for a

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.850
while yeah I went to Dublin Castle they

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.220
like yeah they they they built a castle

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.550
on top of like an old Vikings yeah yeah

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.020
so the Vikings were in Ireland for a

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:32.530
while

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.870
Norman's it's it's all so that like

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.290
white Mayans he was yeah the Pope was

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.150
like a Spanish Inquisitor for sure

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.400
that's 100% he was just like all right

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.760
go [ __ ] them up basically this [ __ ] went

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.950
on for you know centuries where most

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.600
English writers just wrote about Ireland

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.070
during the Middle Ages it was just

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.900
described as a bunch of dudes who still

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.180
ate their dads okay and [ __ ] otherwise

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.880
that's all one court I found was pretty

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.400
interesting was from Edmund Spenser he

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.440
was an English official and poet which

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.450
everybody's a [ __ ] poet back then it

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.740
was a hot thing as bigsley their

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.810
comedian way you could just include it

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.840
in your bio like also I'm a poet

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.830
in 1633 so this is England no no no this

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.360
guy's he's British there's a white

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.800
rapper back then if you're a British

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.090
poet because that was big in Ireland

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.840
yeah he's like a white rapper back then

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.600
16:33 this is an English official this

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.760
is a little little foreshadowing he said

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.509
great force must be the instrument

00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:33.119
to control island but famine must be the

00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:36.149
means for till Ireland can be famished

00:15:36.149 --> 00:15:38.850
it cannot be subdued [ __ ] that's you

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.220
know two centuries before it happens and

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.259
the English official was like yeah they

00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:45.089
could use a good famine heavy the only

00:15:45.089 --> 00:15:46.169
way we're gonna be able to control these

00:15:46.169 --> 00:15:50.579
boys [ __ ] to eat their dad's so sick

00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:52.949
that even like a Greek the whole time

00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:54.809
there that was the knock-on Island yeah

00:15:54.809 --> 00:15:57.089
where they're eating dad's Oh [ __ ] I

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:58.769
feel like everyone was kind of doing

00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:01.290
that right eating their dad yeah well

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:05.100
yeah where they all like pagans yeah but

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.299
that doesn't mean you don't [ __ ] want

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:16.439
your dad gotta be [ __ ] sick your

00:16:16.439 --> 00:16:17.819
daddy get all his powers when he dies

00:16:17.819 --> 00:16:20.819
yeah I mean I can't even imagine what

00:16:20.819 --> 00:16:23.399
Phil would taste like cracking open a

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:27.329
toad yeah your dad is just saying like a

00:16:27.329 --> 00:16:29.129
plaintive briars every night before bed

00:16:29.129 --> 00:16:31.470
it tastes horrible yeah

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:32.910
now if he's eating ice cream before

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.369
Betty sweeten them up true ice veal I

00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:40.259
might start Sweden in my dad so this is

00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:42.359
going on this is 1633 all that I think I

00:16:42.359 --> 00:16:46.169
say foreshadows yeah but that wasn't all

00:16:46.169 --> 00:16:47.639
that was this was before then I think

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.649
yeah who knows who knows when this

00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:51.959
happened the major change happened with

00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:54.269
Ireland in England with King Henry the

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:56.879
eighth you may read you may know him as

back to England it was just like well no

00:17:28.889 --> 00:17:31.679
I'm the Pope and I can get a divorce and

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:33.960
we're starting our own [ __ ] religion

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.690
and now we're the Church of England that

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.669
[ __ ] rules yeah now this is also a

00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:41.940
man who King Henry the eighth was I

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.260
think he was young and athletic

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.410
but then he got hurt Jia sting and

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.630
became a 400-pound he was 400 pounds

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.880
they had to create levers in like

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.150
machines to make him get up [ __ ] and

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:59.290
then he 400 pounds what Mina's [ __ ] he

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.910
had boils all over him from being that

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.000
fat like gal who's a fat [ __ ] who

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.370
wore like this duffy [ __ ] stupid

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.540
outfits and he had a 54 inch waist thick

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.970
boy what yeah they met [ __ ] it and put

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:14.620
it up 54 days yeah because they gotta

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.860
build like seats from the Rose before

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.950
elastic - yeah fix a tee

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.410
yeah it's true yeah I was in the

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.450
original Walmart shopper he was like the

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:28.240
proto Walmart Martone a hundred percent

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.080
damn so then all of England becomes

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.950
Protestant in fat and yeah Chile's [ __ ]

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:41.740
to be fat so so then England demands

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.280
Ireland become Protestant because they

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.780
are they're like you're in our kingdom

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.900
you are our religion and that's why

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.900
Irish people are so Catholic mmm it's

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.700
not this like love of the church because

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.100
they still hate it's a bunch of [ __ ]

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.049
Italians yeah the Irish Catholics don't

00:18:59.049 --> 00:19:00.760
give a [ __ ] about Rome they just hate

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.710
England sure that's why they're so

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.860
overtly Catholic out of a big [ __ ] you

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.809
to England that's all they're like Jews

00:19:07.809 --> 00:19:12.669
in that way slow down yeah we're like

00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:15.700
culturally Catholic yeah it really is it

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:20.919
totally yeah totally culturally again so

00:19:20.919 --> 00:19:24.400
they we already covered that this

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.500
resulted in a bunch of laws so that's

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.059
what sets this up that's what's that's

00:19:28.059 --> 00:19:29.980
everything up so when when England goes

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.200
to becoming Protestant the Irish remain

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.110
Catholic England starts to issue these

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.840
laws that start to make the Irish not be

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.100
Catholic and they start to because

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.410
England wanted them to be English so

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.030
they could so they'd stop [ __ ] their

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.179
moms and eating their dads yeah you need

00:19:49.179 --> 00:19:51.130
to start acting right instead of the

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.110
best they enacted basically the pull up

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.299
your pants laws the British were like

00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:57.710
you need to start acting right

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.419
basically they did what every like white

00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:02.700
racist dude wishes the laws he wishes he

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.870
can enforce on black people

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.100
none of that music no more basketball

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.970
that's what they did to the Irish they

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.470
like you can't play your music you can't

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.390
be that religion you can't play hurling

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:16.049
the national sport all this was on her

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:19.020
leg against against the law yeah you

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.700
were know how this is might be an older

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.660
law but you weren't allowed to own a

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.390
horse that was worth more than like five

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.230
shilling or whatever the [ __ ] they were

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:32.880
using they all had shitty horses check

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.799
out the Blue Book on this it's in bad

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:41.370
conditions but they yeah I bet they they

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.950
I bet they [ __ ] the air so bad on that

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.650
one just had like yeah they just take

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.030
someone's horse by just having one of

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.620
their friends go up and be like I'd pave

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.900
genetics so if you have a horse it just

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.090
is nice that is born and there's like a

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:01.710
nice horse English Lord would also you

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.299
weren't allowed to own property if you

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:05.490
were Catholic so the whole country is

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.280
not allowed to own land so they had a

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.380
bunch of these landlords and [ __ ] than

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.120
just controlled Ireland tenant like

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.130
these landlords that would come over it

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.210
some of them were Irish that just

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.950
claimed like you know I'm Protestant

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.700
yeah so that was that was a big so you

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.620
couldn't own land you couldn't vote you

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.990
couldn't sing you couldn't play the

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.270
sport that like you can play your NAT

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.730
which is why the Irish owes horribly

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.130
unathletic

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.450
for you for centuries they weren't

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.510
allowed to play a [ __ ] sport all

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:43.980
these laws like oh good yeah it's crazy

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.840
to do anything you couldn't do anything

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.669
that was in English and you had to

00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:50.400
convert to Protestantism to vote and own

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.210
land Jesus but yet it didn't take people

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.270
people stuck behind take it made the

00:21:56.270 --> 00:22:00.419
opposite happen more Catholic they would

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:02.730
[ __ ] hide out and have secret

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.140
religious ceremonies [ __ ] like that

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.940
this is worse group of people to start

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.309
that on man the Irish yeah yeah for sure

00:22:08.309 --> 00:22:10.550
what are the Protestants do what

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.900
they do what are they like what do they

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.350
do differently do they have communion

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.190
there's something about they don't

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.730
believe in trans substantiation so maybe

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.380
they don't do communion stuff like that

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.030
I think they still do it break bread I

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.460
think they just like break like bread

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.810
and this is a nice we should eat this

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.100
bread together I don't know I forget

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.280
about that transubstantiation is the

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.260
body of Christ becoming an actual good

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.120
but that doesn't mean you still don't

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.390
you know break the bread symbolically I

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.820
think it's stuff like that where I don't

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.470
know I remember reading about your

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.210
daughter has big blonde hot and mean

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:49.910
true Martin Luther like I think I was

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.020
talking about leery about it we're like

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.090
originally Martin Luther obviously was

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.360
Catholic before so like the original

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.150
like Protestant Reformation was very it

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.990
still kept like most of the Catholic

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.940
traditions mhm and then as it went on it

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.000
got a little more [ __ ] up they

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.280
shutting down they shut Ireland down and

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.430
a lot of this big chunk of this book

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.570
in the immortal Irishmen when it's

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:19.730
opening is about Oliver Cromwell in 1649

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.380
Oliver Cromwell came through and just

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.900
was [ __ ] to everybody this was

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.510
right after the second English Civil War

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.810
so it was like I don't know the Irish

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:31.400
were kind of like hopefully you know

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.140
England they were did Oliver Cromwell

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.970
came over and just slaughtered had a

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.370
civil England yeah yeah there was always

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.430
over like who should be king yeah who's

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.190
Cromwell who's that dude Oliver Cromwell

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.620
was I don't know he's a general the

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.480
English he was a politician for the

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.280
English in he came over he finds a lot

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.200
of [ __ ] up he [ __ ] it [ __ ] or not he

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.850
was yeah I mean he's like very faint

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.860
like English history I think looks at

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.790
him glowingly yeah he [ __ ] up Scotland

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:04.250
- yeah it was a beast so Cromwell comes

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.540
over and starts [ __ ] up Ireland and

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.370
that was they bud pounded Ireland

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.790
basically until now from then so from

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:15.740
from 1649 until like oh no the eighties

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.070
like when you two came out yeah once you

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.920
two came out Ireland was finally

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.230
independent so there's all this like

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.669
and then that gets the potato famine

00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:30.109
which is like 45 to 49 mm 18 yeah yeah

00:24:30.109 --> 00:24:34.369
yeah 1845 to 1849 but we'll get to that

00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:38.119
yeah or will we I forget it's a good

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:40.009
stage set I forget this is a good

00:24:40.009 --> 00:24:42.230
setting of a page that gives us that

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.840
sets us up to Thomas Moore all right hmm

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.509
so that's all this leads to Thomas Moore

00:24:47.509 --> 00:24:51.019
so 1823 Thomas Marr was born in

00:24:51.019 --> 00:24:55.519
Waterford Ireland his grandfather

00:24:55.519 --> 00:24:58.220
so Thomas Marr is rich mm-hmm he's a

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:58.850
rich kid

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.429
Waterford waterfords dope and you went

00:25:01.429 --> 00:25:02.989
there I think it's on the west coast

00:25:02.989 --> 00:25:05.869
yeah I think so yeah yeah yeah no I

00:25:05.869 --> 00:25:08.330
water playing ruins water town it was

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:09.769
like an old town is one of the oldest

00:25:09.769 --> 00:25:12.049
towns there's a Viking castle and [ __ ]

00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:13.090
like that

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.309
um Thomas More's grandfather went over

00:25:16.309 --> 00:25:18.950
to [ __ ] Newfoundland and started a

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.799
shipping company back and forth so

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:23.600
because he couldn't own land or like own

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.009
a business in Ireland he just went over

00:25:25.009 --> 00:25:27.129
to Canada Newfoundland I think was like

00:25:27.129 --> 00:25:31.700
80% Irish in Canada so he started the

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.710
shipping company of like fish [ __ ] like

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.749
that he would bring that over would

00:25:35.749 --> 00:25:37.489
bring back like grains and all that you

00:25:37.489 --> 00:25:39.980
know set up a [ __ ] sick sick business

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.720
he went over there is like a farmer

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.239
ended up becoming it on a ship then he

you know like that could have been his

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.389
life so throw that into the mix he had

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:28.429
the opportunity to just be an Instagram

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:31.419

00:34:31.419 --> 00:34:34.460

independence so he starts he starts with

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:44.990
O'Connell now the the problem with

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:47.089
O'Connell was he was he was more of a

00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:50.540
moderate mm-hmm so his is his protege

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.730
not his protege he's [ __ ] mentor

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:54.669
O'Connell was a bit of a [ __ ]

00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:57.020
moderate that was working with the

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.450
British like he was he's getting what he

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:04.250
could out of it which O'Connell's known

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:05.359
as The Liberator because he was the

00:35:05.359 --> 00:35:07.040
first to try like he was repealing the

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.400
acts of Union which like in 1800 that

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.200
was you know just more oppressive [ __ ]

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.730
they were like you're you're part of our

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.670
kingdom you're always part of theydon't

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:18.049
pretty sick though in the acts of Union

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:21.470
in 1800 they to incorporate England or

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:22.980
Ireland into England

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.880
I included the cross of st. Patrick into

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.080
their flag and they still have it

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.119
what and still in the British flag even

00:35:30.119 --> 00:35:32.300

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.940
Dublin they were saying Dublin was like

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.920
the biggest like the second biggest city

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.880

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.210
was all like Protestants and like

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:17.100
English loyalists and then I think this

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.530
Scot the scots-irish scotch-irish had

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.270
like a weird thing where the English

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:22.710
were bringing the Scottish in to help

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.510
the Irish assimilate like the Scottish

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.090
that moved to Ireland what kind of

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:31.560
loyalists there was a lot of like yeah

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.450
there was also a thing the the English

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:35.460
built a wall they built the wall dude

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.530

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.290
counties of Ireland to keep all the

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:42.119
shitty Irish out it's just a wall and

00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:44.280
the wall was called the pale so now when

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.869
you hear someone say beyond the pale as

00:36:45.869 --> 00:36:48.060
something that's shitty it goes back to

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.550
that they built the pale was the name of

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.140
the wall and if you lived beyond it you

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.240

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.890

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.470
how like sexually liberated this group

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:33.250

break happen between with him and

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:59.450
O'Connell O'Connell is kind of fighting

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:01.460
for a more moderate approach like a

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.130
maybe [ __ ] chill now this is 1846

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:06.619
this is the end of the famine err no no

00:43:06.619 --> 00:43:08.720
it's starting potato famine it's like 45

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.359
to 49 okay so this is like the second

00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:13.550
year in a row that the potato famine

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.109
happened now I think we've we've talked

00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:16.460
about it on the cast before the potato

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.350
famine first off a [ __ ] million

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:22.190
people died yeah it's crazy like four

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:24.609
years in Ireland what was the population

00:43:24.609 --> 00:43:27.470
10 million yeah it was most of the

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:31.250
people died and again this is most of

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.590
the people died of starvation so this

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:35.720
and and typhus took over because

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.190
everybody's just no one could move

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:39.380
they're just packed into tenements like

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.470
just there was this this guy that went

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:44.510
in and like was inspecting tenements oh

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:45.980
[ __ ] he was like every room you would go

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.410
in you'd lift up a blanket and there'd

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.080
be a pile of kids that were still alive

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.730
that were starving that couldn't move oh

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.920
there's piles of kids because the Irish

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.440
you know they're out [ __ ] yeah they are

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.880
not falling out so every house has

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.340
[ __ ] nine kids they're all starved to

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:05.060
death a million people this was insane

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.730
it's pretty bad man I mean the the

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.430
imagery of like walking into a dirty

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:13.970
smelly hut and finding a pile of kids

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:14.990
that were all still

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.510
I've yeah starving to death they said

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:18.980
they would have green teeth because they

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.350
were all eating [ __ ] grass they were

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:22.640
trying to survive on whatever they could

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.420
just eating

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.070
there's the stories about like people

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:26.690
that lived in cities that would just see

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:28.760
people coming out of the woods from the

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.550
from the countryside just the entire

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:33.590
villages would come out of the [ __ ]

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:38.080
wilderness like help there's no food

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.490
imagine going to a family party it is

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:42.230
never ended and you guys all died from

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:47.119
there being no food how does the pasta

00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:51.290
so yeah I mean you've grown we'd imagine

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:52.550
you don't mean like you'd be like mad

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:55.900
it'd be just as hard you could well also

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:59.660
would it yeah the blood it was as far as

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.670
the potatoes go they were gone there's

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:03.920
this blight that apparently I think came

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.800
from America sick sup baby

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.590
so there was like a real infection of

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:13.790
yes it was like a real scientist I were

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:15.140
what it was like and the spores just

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.670
traveled through the air and killed

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:19.609
everything yeah and what's crazy about

00:45:19.609 --> 00:45:21.770
it is like the hills like the

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:23.720
countryside would like the you'd see a

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.550
potato field like it would be rolling

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:26.840
acres of it

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:31.040
and during the blight the potatoes would

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.880
rot so they turn black and rot and smell

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:37.609
so you just see black fields everywhere

00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:41.270
that's stunk I mean it's crazy it's

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.790
really like nightmarish what happened

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:46.790
yeah and they had food again they had

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:49.340
grain they taught thousands of tons of

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:53.240
grain they cattle that it there's a one

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:56.090
story of like they still had their

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:59.030
annual like best cow competition in this

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:02.420
town where they just marched like giant

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.920
cattle through this town

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.410
Oh in the past people dying in the

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:10.220
streets of hunger I mean it's this is

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.720
like English people do with it yeah yeah

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.320
yeah all the like faint like rich Irish

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.520
English aristocrats why are you so lazy

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.990
then the guy I forget his name I should

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:23.540
have had that the guy who was like in

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.210
charge of taking care of the Irish he by

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:28.150
the English

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:29.620
like he was the head of the famine

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.140
relief they found like secret notes of

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:33.430
his that was like I think this is God

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:35.580
because the Irish are pieces of [ __ ]

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.960
like I think God is doing this this is

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.350
good good cleansing of these people they

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:44.200
had [ __ ] so the United States was

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.660
trying to give them famine relief the

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.080
Irish England would block it the rest of

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:50.740
the world

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.800

00:50:07.229 --> 00:50:08.609
include that like during the potato

00:50:08.609 --> 00:50:12.209
famine also known as the great hunger

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:15.269
they would they would this is when

00:50:15.269 --> 00:50:17.459

famine trying to steal like bread and

00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:08.890

everything you know [ __ ] out of this I

00:53:18.279 --> 00:53:19.749
mean I was also thinking about that one

00:53:19.749 --> 00:53:21.819
of the guys one of Mars boys gets

00:53:21.819 --> 00:53:24.309
transported to like the West Indies

00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:26.109
mm-hmm and they're like I mean it does

00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:29.619
suck he was in like a prison ship in the

00:53:29.619 --> 00:53:33.519
[ __ ] Heat yeah that's gotta be kinda

00:53:33.519 --> 00:53:34.599
nice to be in the Caribbean

00:53:34.599 --> 00:53:36.309
there's nothing but just at night on a

00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:43.499
beach like oh yeah yeah but I bet it was

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:48.069
tropical island there's back then there

00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:51.759
was no service you were the servant also

00:53:51.759 --> 00:53:55.809
raining and I've got to include this the

00:53:55.809 --> 00:53:58.710
Irish were slaves

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.470
Cromwell sent out thousands and

00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:04.319
thousands of Irish people to be slaves

00:54:04.319 --> 00:54:09.269
where did they slave where they slave

00:54:10.499 --> 00:54:22.150
you talk like the [ __ ] they were

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:23.799
slaving and all the British Empire I

00:54:23.799 --> 00:54:25.329
mean but mostly I think the Caribbean I

00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:26.619
think that you get some Irish down in

00:54:26.619 --> 00:54:29.220
Jamaica and the Bahamas and [ __ ] really

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.619
yeah

00:54:31.619 --> 00:54:34.869
how are they they ever get many how they

00:54:34.869 --> 00:54:37.720
over the Irish slaves I would imagine

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.400
the Irish were pretty bad slaves

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.700
especially being sent to Jamaica with

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.069
that skin yeah how much they must have

00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:51.210
burnt Oh complaint I bet they're [ __ ]

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:57.489
rebellion we need to rebuild so that's

00:54:57.489 --> 00:54:58.920
going on that's what's going on

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.450
basically like in white trash in that

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:03.819
book where like the British again just

00:55:03.819 --> 00:55:05.980
sent shitty people to these countries to

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:07.599
kind of like all right you guys build

00:55:07.599 --> 00:55:09.670
some roads and shitty houses then we'll

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:11.950
move in with good people and start

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:13.690
farming they just like sent like poor

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:15.640
people to terraform they sent poor

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.589
people to go fight off whatever animals

00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:19.720
and natives were there

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:24.220
and then went in just running average

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.800
and he's just some Irish guys yeah

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.450
there's a food nick Mullen has one of my

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:31.420
favorite jokes about how much how much

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.220
like Western culture dominates those

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.460
natives like Native cut like that

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.650
Australian native you know aboriginals

00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:45.760
and their weapons are now toys toys for

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:51.310
children all right so that's what's

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:54.190
that's what's going on Mar is with the

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:55.990
nation now which is that paper it's a

00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:58.840
seditious paper the talk [ __ ] their

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.310
revolutionary but they do it through

00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:04.930
like poetry and like real romantic [ __ ]

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.000
and that his whole squad is [ __ ] like

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.150
poets and actors yeah so I kind of don't

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:12.400
like them I think it's got that cool

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.320
[ __ ] yeah and I don't like him yeah

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.990
that's based off today's yeah yeah so

00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:19.240
none of them are soldiers none of them

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:22.140
are [ __ ] ready to start a revolution

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:25.210
other generals they have no idea what

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:26.830
they're doing that's kind of where this

00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:30.369
thing gets bud [ __ ] 1846 this is a

00:56:30.369 --> 00:56:33.490
place called conciliation Hall in Dublin

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:35.470
so that's where they would all come to

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:37.480
meet and discuss this was where the big

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:40.810
divide started because 1846 again it's

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:44.770
like year two of the famine but that was

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:45.849
another thing about the potato famine

00:56:45.849 --> 00:56:49.119
that really was really like hurt was

00:56:49.119 --> 00:56:52.060
every year with a new crop like they

00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:54.040
would start out good and they'd be like

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:56.680
nice it's over yeah and then the blight

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.490
would happen again

00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:59.740
and like you would have to race to try

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.240
to eat as many as you could before they

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.020
went bad and they went bad like

of the then burnt baby all right so this

01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:25.980
is 1846 they look after the I think it

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:31.860
started with a B 1848 so that was 46 the

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.450
next like two years they're riding

01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:35.580

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.590
Islanders I keep calling the Islanders

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:41.550

they did that which is sick which is

01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:55.380

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.120
from again you can't knock this guy

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.620

01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:00.720
incredibly rich family it's like all the

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.250

an autographed copy on DVD all right

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.280
this is very wild oh so in 1848 I think

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.770
the the round their young Islanders went

01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:59.900
to France to study this while he was in

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:02.540
there Thomas Marr invented the Irish

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:05.330
flag he created the Irish flag pretty

01:07:05.330 --> 01:07:07.250
sick yeah same one they're using today

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:12.110
what was from him Catholics white is

01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:15.110
peace orange is kind of England but it's

01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:16.850
the Protestants saw the Protestants in

01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:19.100
Ireland not not the British sure because

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:20.810
he was you know he hated the bridge yeah

01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:22.100
the Protestants the orange we're

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.390
supposed to represent the Irish that

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:25.250
were processed also this is pretty well

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.680
during the forgot to talk about this

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.600
during the potato famine they would set

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:33.590
up soup kitchens mmm that were you had

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:36.080
to they were Protestant missionaries

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.970
that the British would send over soup

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:40.160
kitchens set them up in town and be like

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.110
you have to admit your Protestant or you

01:07:42.110 --> 01:07:43.760
can't get the soup so you would have to

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.430
denounce your God or your religion to

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:48.620
get the soup so there's a phrase if you

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.960
took the soup that's somebody who took

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:53.870
the suit so you took the soup if you saw

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:55.250
someone eating soup you're like you've

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:59.240
[ __ ] you [ __ ] tough yeah I think the

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.300
O'Connor family took this soup big soup

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:10.150
takers soup you took the Sheep a chance

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:13.340
so then when they get back from France

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.500
same year that's when they have their

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:19.640
revolution which stunk yeah I only think

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.600

01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:28.790
revolution just stunk

01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:32.240
they ended up chasing in a town Balon

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.599
Gary it's called the Battle of balangay

01:08:35.599 --> 01:08:37.489

like a family hostage the [ __ ] Irish

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:51.799
revolutionaries surrounded it in like a

01:08:51.799 --> 01:08:55.069
Cabbage Patch so they're standing in and

01:08:55.069 --> 01:08:57.259

they can't stop us dude him yeah my

01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:58.590
Lords it is my intention to say a few

01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:01.200
words only I desire the last act of a

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.150
proceeding which is occupied so much of

01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:05.160
the public time should be of short

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.710
duration nor hot nor have I the

01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:09.750
indelicate wish to close the dreary

01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:12.420
ceremony of a state prosecution with a

01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:15.000
vain display of words did I fear that

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.520
hereafter when I shall be no more the

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.860
country I tried to serve would speak ill

01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:22.470
of me I might indeed avail myself of

01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:24.300
this solemn moment to vindicate my

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:26.700
sentiments and my conduct but I have no

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:28.739
such fear the country will judge of

01:16:28.739 --> 01:16:30.780
those sentiments and that conduct in a

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:32.910
light far different from that in which

01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:34.590
the jury by whom I have been convicted

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:37.110
have viewed them and by the country the

01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:39.060
sentence which you my Lords are about to

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:41.310
pronounce will be remembered only as a

01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:43.440
severe in solemn attestation of my

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.750
rectitude and truth whatever be the

01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:47.160
language in which that sentence be

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.810
spoken I know that my fate will meet

01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:50.880
with sympathy and that my memory will be

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.460
honored in speaking thus accuse me not

01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:55.620
my Lords of an indecorous

01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:57.630
presumption in the efforts I have made

01:16:57.630 --> 01:17:00.690
in a just and noble cause I ascribe no

01:17:00.690 --> 01:17:03.390
main importance nor do I claim for those

01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:05.820
efforts any high reward but it so

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:07.950
happens and it will ever happen so that

01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:09.420
they who have lived to serve their

01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.250
country no matter how weak their efforts

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:13.410
may have been are sure to receive the

01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:15.870
thanks and blessings of its people with

01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:17.910
my countrymen I leave my memory my

01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:20.160
sentiments my acts proudly feeling that

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.140
they've require no vindication from me

01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:24.840
this day a jury of my countrymen it's

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.730
true have found me guilty of the crime

01:17:26.730 --> 01:17:28.179
of which I stood and died

01:17:28.179 --> 01:17:30.520
for this I entertained not the slightest

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.260
feeling of resentment towards them

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.360
influence as they must have been by the

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.820
charge of the Lord Chief Justice they

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:38.020
could perhaps have found no other

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:38.830
verdict

01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:40.989
what have that charge any strong

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:42.790
observations on it I feel sincerely

01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:44.830
would be would it benefit the solemnity

01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:46.960
of this scene but I would earnestly

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:49.449
beseech of you my lord you preside on

01:17:49.449 --> 01:17:51.400
that bench when the passions and the

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.080
prejudice of this hour have passed away

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.810
to appeal to your own conscience and ask

01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:58.030
of it was your charge what it ought to

01:17:58.030 --> 01:18:00.219
have been impartial and indifferent

01:18:00.219 --> 01:18:02.500
between the subject and the crown my

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:03.850
Lords you may deem this language

01:18:03.850 --> 01:18:06.070
unbecoming in me and perhaps it may seal

01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:07.960
my fate but I am here to speak the truth

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.510
whatever it may cost I'm here to regret

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:12.520
nothing I have ever done to retract

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.770
nothing I have ever said I'm here to

01:18:14.770 --> 01:18:16.690
crave with no lying lip the life I

01:18:16.690 --> 01:18:18.760
concentrate to the liberty of my country

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.820
far from it even here here where the

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:23.620
thief the libertine the murderer have

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:26.110
left their footprints in the dust here

01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:27.790
on the spot where the shadows of death

01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:29.830
surround me and from which I see my

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.050
early grave and a nun anointed soil open

01:18:32.050 --> 01:18:34.480
to receive me even here encircled by

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.370
these terrors that Hope which first

01:18:36.370 --> 01:18:38.110
beckoned me to the perilous sea on which

01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:39.969
I have been wrecked still consoles and

01:18:39.969 --> 01:18:43.030
animates and enraptures me no I do not

01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:45.280
despair of my poor old country her peace

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.920
her Liberty her glory for that country I

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.130
can do no more than bid her hope to lift

01:18:51.130 --> 01:18:53.650
this island up make her a benefactor to

01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:55.840
humanity instead of being as she is now

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:58.210
the meanest beggar in the world to

01:18:58.210 --> 01:19:00.159
restore to her her native powers and her

01:19:00.159 --> 01:19:02.350
ancient constitution this has been my

01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:04.420
ambition and then this ambition has been

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:07.300
my crime judged by the law of England I

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.070
know this crime entails upon me the

01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:11.050
penalty of death but the history of

01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:12.429
Ireland explains that crime and

01:19:12.429 --> 01:19:15.280
justifies it judged by that history the

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.290
treason of which I stand convicted loses

01:19:17.290 --> 01:19:19.810
all its guilt has been sanctified as a

01:19:19.810 --> 01:19:21.640
duty and will be a noble Dazz a

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.600
sacrifice

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.210
with these sentence sentiments I await

01:19:25.210 --> 01:19:27.580
the sentence of the court I've done what

01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:28.929
I felt to be my duty

01:19:28.929 --> 01:19:30.760
I have spoken now as I did on every

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.739
other occasion during my short life what

01:19:32.739 --> 01:19:34.929
I felt to be the truth I now bid

01:19:34.929 --> 01:19:36.730
farewell to the country of my birth of

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:39.130
my passions of my death a country whose

01:19:39.130 --> 01:19:41.800
misfortunes have invoked my sympathies

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.840
whose factions I sought to quell whose

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.850
intelligence I prompted to a lofty aim

01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:49.120
whose freedom has been my fatal dream to

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.070
that country I now offer as a pledge of

01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:53.440
their of the love I bore her and of the

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.360
sincerity with which I thought and spoke

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.610
and struggled for her freedom the life

01:19:57.610 --> 01:19:59.290
of a young heart and with that life the

01:19:59.290 --> 01:20:01.480
hopes the honours the endearments of a

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.720
happy a prosperous and honorable home

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:06.370
proceed then my Lords with that sentence

01:20:06.370 --> 01:20:08.260
which the law directs I am prepared to

01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:10.420
hear it I trust I am prepared to meet

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:11.290
its execution

01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:13.480
I shall go I think with a light heart

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:16.120
before a higher tribunal a tribunal

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.860
where a judge of infinite goodness as

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:19.960
well as in of infinite justice will

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:22.870
preside and where my Lords many many of

01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:24.250
the judgments of this world will be

01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:30.220
reversed let's get it

01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:32.050

so this is right around I think it's

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:06.730
Queen Victoria she was young she was his

01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:10.690
age roughly so and everybody loved her

01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:14.380
she was like this good nice queen so she

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:16.270
had that reputation even though you know

01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:20.320
she she was still you know actively

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.290
overlooking the [ __ ] genocide of

01:21:23.290 --> 01:21:25.200
Ireland

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.610
she started yet there was started to be

01:21:27.610 --> 01:21:29.500
national outrage cuz Mara was releasing

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:30.790
all these Press comment like all these

01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:33.070
letters and all this [ __ ] you know he

01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:35.050
was saying [ __ ] like heed that speech

01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:37.150
we're just like I'm like God will judge

01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:38.770
me yeah yeah yeah and it will be

01:21:38.770 --> 01:21:40.420
reversed like this isn't a crime

01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:43.150
yeah so there's outrage there was

01:21:43.150 --> 01:21:46.120
worldwide outrage and like England who's

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.940
supposed to be this the leader of the

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.890
world basically basically like the way

01:21:50.890 --> 01:21:52.780
where you know like Texas executes

01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:55.030
[ __ ] guys yeah like the rest of the

01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.420
world's like

01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:56.739
you guys supposed to be like the light

01:21:56.739 --> 01:22:01.750
on the hill or whatever so the rest of

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.489
the world was like yeah don't [ __ ]

01:22:03.489 --> 01:22:06.790
cut this guy apart and throw his legs in

01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:09.969
a different town yeah so it gets the

01:22:09.969 --> 01:22:11.920
point where there's enough pressure on

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.440
them that they don't they revoke they

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.020

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:19.330
every one of the the young Islanders is

01:22:19.330 --> 01:22:23.260

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:54.460
finds the area where him and his friends

01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:56.380
meet at this creek bed where there's

01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:58.510
like a tiny bridge and once a week they

01:23:58.510 --> 01:24:00.160

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.679
and had dinner together pretty sick he

01:24:02.679 --> 01:24:04.929
just lived in Tasmania with a dog in a

01:24:04.929 --> 01:24:08.650
shack pretty sick pretty sick but he

01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:09.610
still had dreams

01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:12.730
still had dreams of a revolution and

01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:15.670

01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:34.090
time for being he just hated the
