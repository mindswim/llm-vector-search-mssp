Title: Next Level
Description: The walls of the #LakeLife house are thin and chatter is everywhere. Shane grabs some Landsharks and hits the couch for a rather fiery cast. Cusk has been programming hard, but feels off. He misses Shane and Shane misses him. Can they make it through this trying times? There love is strong, but can it withstand this scourge that definitely is NOT a bio weapon sent to destroy us?

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.640
there's some vitamin C and you're gonna

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.680
you're gonna beat this virus and it's

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.940
not even mad I'll tell you something

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.400
it's not some natural virus this is

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.620
clearly man-made if you if you put this

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.810
under a microscope you'd be able to see

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.430
it it's like seeing tits that have like

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.840
scars really those are fake did you see

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.300
the donk ovid come on miss do you see

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.120
the thing on a fake this was made the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.620
Chad comps made this and it leaked out

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.910
of their Factory it's I mean it's a

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.700
stage four level containment in woo him

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.560
mm-hmm but it definitely it definitely

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.880
leaked they have leaks all the time

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.560
whether this was intentional or not this

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.780
was a bio weapon from the cha comps I'd

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.670
only using know it so I watched him a

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.040
video on YouTube from a guy who had

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.570
lived in China for ten years who came

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.670
back and he was saying that this was an

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.310
accident but the cover-up is real so

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.770
they were apparently he's like the ropes

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.480
very very real well he was saying you

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.340
can look up all these records a lady was

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.320
studying the links between bats and

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.270
coronaviruses and it's specifically the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.160
transmission from coronavirus from bats

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.470
to humans and apparently when you

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.940
isolate a vai this is a chord in the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.470
video and you're isolated I think she

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.570
took her work home and I think probably

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.160
her husband got into the fridge and

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.100
talked it was like oh nice it's too bad

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.320
yeah apparently when you when you study

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.050
a virus you gotta like amp it up like I

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.160
want to find out if there's a connection

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.510
between stuff cross and mozzarella stick

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.420
just some husband opens the fridge finds

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.550
a container of bats and it's just like

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.100

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.480
[ __ ] kill us did I read an article in

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.370
the Atlantic about fluoride which

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.960
Atlantic is like you know suppose like a

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.540
pretty tempered publication so this guy

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.400
did a research thing I guess a couple

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.540
people have done this to make fun of

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.590
like people who freaked out about

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.800
fluoride and turns out there's no real

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.410
scientific consensus what is it with

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.160
journalists trying to like quell and

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.590
ruin conspiracies constantly because I

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.610
looked up I looked up the the trip

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.970
journalist just ruin everything the

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.350
we're [ __ ] the Lyme disease came from

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.070
yeah

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.860
all right you ever hear about that no

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.170
right so there's a there's a I mean this

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.450
is level 3 stuff this is mostly animal

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.550
because these kind of like figuring [ __ ]

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.100
out my lyrics cue level clearance it's

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.150
it's light like clickers

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.890
you me might be able to get a job there

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.410
okay self this if we are resume was this

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.820
cast there'd be a guy you guys know what

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.630
you're doing is it's a they'd it's an

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.090
animal disease like facility on Plum

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.310
Island its off like Long Island in New

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.280
York it's a military base now in 2002 I

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.690
think it was bought by Homeland Security

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.360
but it used to be Department of

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.130
Agriculture and in 1970 when 1975 I

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.340
think when Lyme disease broke out it was

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.010
from like contaminated they're like it's

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.080
probably from Plum Island it's in Lyme

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.850
Connecticut which is right across the

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.250
water from there like it's probably

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.980
either from birds or from deer can swim

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.280
sometimes deer get wild and swim then

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.820
they think some deer got out of that I

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.320
think that means deer swam like 40 miles

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.110
hold on wait I thought it's from a tick

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.730
yeah ticks on those deer so the tick

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.730
from the deer transmitted it to humans

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.250
yeah but it was from allegedly it was

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.750
from Plum Island and like government

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.740
testing on that like a barn China yes

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:54.760
it's China China I'm still laughing

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.320
about the bats in the fridge hello you

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.700
know everyone's like they don't have

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.470
heart attacks in China it's like okay

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.730
yeah but like every now and again you

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.860
eat the wrong thing you're like yeah

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.750
they're all-natural over there Eastern

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.190
medicine psych here they also [ __ ]

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:16.300
like a slurp salamander Super Bowl party

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.640
someone just lays down a plate of like

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.200
crawling it beat the [ __ ] out you

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:29.410
neutralize them that's pretty young oh

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.700
they're nice to bring out the guinea

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.420
pigs eats of gerbils at halftime it

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.890
could be how you get so good at chopping

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.510
planks in half because like imagine a

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.460
week you know to open Doritos boxes but

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.870
imagine if you had to like crack a live

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.550
crate like a wooden crate every time you

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.950
want it to munch do you like [ __ ] I

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:50.320
always [ __ ] punch through a wooden

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.450
crate a bunch of [ __ ] animals

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.340
yeah good do the floor icing is real man

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.800
I looked into it what is why is it so

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.330
funny that they eat different things

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.560
people get upset like you know how to

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.200
make fun of that it's like they're

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.940
eating funny animals it's funny

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.160
they're definitely I mean eating a bad I

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.840
mean Ozzy Osbourne again he ain't a bad

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.220
never never eat yet it was like an that

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.020
was crazy

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.520
but if Ozzy Osbourne eats a bat you can

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.310
say he's like a twisted weirdo but if a

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.070
Chinese person he's a bat yesterday yeah

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.080
oh that's [ __ ] that's their culture

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.320
maybe all Chinese just dark twisted

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.090
[ __ ] metalheads hey they're just a

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.930
little twisted bro

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.900
twisted maybe their Black Sabbath a

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.320
breakfast every as the national anthem

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.570
the generals gathered in the masses

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:59.240
general so no no that's even funny none

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.730
of it's even funny it's just junk dude

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.080
that's pretty far general so yeah the

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:09.770
Masters yeah dude they they have no

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.260
consensus on fluoride man

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.520
that's the time of the Manhattan Project

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.920
this is I mean to be honest this is you

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.290
acted all at the time of the Manhattan

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.920
Project

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.110
they were sources part of I guess

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.330
enriching plutonium or something one of

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.890
the byproducts of the experiments they

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:25.730
were doing to make nuclear weapons

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.190
created a ton of fluoride and it was

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.720
justly it was seaching it was going into

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.790
the groundwater and then right around

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.710
that time they're like [ __ ] this sucks

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.600
and they're like something came out

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.980
where Walt it where there was heavy

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.200
fluoride from all this activity P

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.580
they're like people have a little bit

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.140
less cavities there and they're like

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.700
[ __ ] it run that they started studying

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.170
and putting it out but they've looked at

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.000
these studies retro actively there's

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.430
thousands of them and by today's

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.560
standards in terms of like protocols

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.420
like the variables and all the stuff

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.850
like three of them stand up and they're

00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.560
they're vague and shaky so that fluoride

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.290
salesmen must be a hell of a Salesman

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.700
well it was ever it was just they had

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.900
enough this [ __ ] was leaking in

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.280
the ground so they were like what the

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.750
[ __ ] are we gonna do about this oh this

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.590
is good for your teeth we're actually

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.660
we're adding this to your water it was

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.660
already in some water so a floor eggs in

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.820
our water just to help our teeth just

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.650
adjust to help and it doesn't do it the

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.780
only thing they say it's a last-ditch

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.400
effort for people who don't brush their

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.830
teeth that's how they rationalize it now

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.050
they say well yeah you and I don't need

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.220
fluoride but there's some people who are

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.930
so poor they don't brush their teeth and

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.250
this will help them from the all their

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.980
teeth falling out that's it there's

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.840
that's that's that's all and it because

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.490
you have fluoride in your toothpaste so

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:38.990
why would you need to drink it it makes

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.640
no it makes no sense why they put it in

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.560
there yeah but the funny thing is

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.270
apparently everyone used to lose their

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.010
teeth back in like GWS day in George

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.770
Washington 1776 do you know do you know

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.300
there was I gonna listen to like a tooth

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.180
trade like George Washington had he had

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.880
horse teeth in his mouth he had to bowl

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.710
he had wooden teeth he also had some

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.750
slaves teeth in their clay I just saw

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.880
that dude he holds leaves teeth in there

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.740
it's no good dude he had a set of

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.540
dentures made from his own pulled teeth

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.450
from donkey and horse up top a Kia Cal

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.780
tooth and then he had yes lady his slave

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.000
teeth in there just that's why they made

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.300
grills there to protect from [ __ ] gay

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.780
from a founding father your mouth is

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.890
icing up yeah that's funny white people

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.180
have tooth fairies black people have

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.950
founding fathers come in at night and

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:31.730
snatch your teeth that could be where

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.180
the Tooth Fairy came from

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.040
on the battlefields back then dude they

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.930
would go for the soldiers as soon as if

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.190
someone was dead you would just if

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.330
you're on the battlefield you were pop

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.920
teeth out of everybody you go home and

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.510
you'd have mad [ __ ] teeth yo who

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.510
needs chomps damn dude George Washington

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:53.590
had a donkey and a kal teeth nuts

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.420
GW dude my president I know the god

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.480
that's why everyone's like sorry my nose

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.330
it's yeah there everybody's always

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.550
talking about how like stoic and silent

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.110
he was just like he couldn't talk all

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:12.130

a few words well what a great guy I said

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.630
[ __ ] County

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:23.350
[Laughter]

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:34.040

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.050
killing me here okay probably I'd like

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:46.130
riffraff you ever see riffraff [ __ ]

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.079
that was killing me sooo so maybe

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:51.050
fluoride work do we all have guys some

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.959
great teeth here in America no it's

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:56.029
cause we actually eat and stuff fact

00:13:56.029 --> 00:13:58.130
that it wouldn't eat forever no nobody

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.050
brush your teeth but then our sugar

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.839
consumptions up and there's there's they

00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:04.399
did a study to of countries who never

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:06.560
did fluoride in their cavities and

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.790
countries who did dude fluoride and

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.820
stopped it no different that we for some

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.649
reason have fluoride in a water it's not

00:14:12.649 --> 00:14:16.070
a parent as to what it does so maybe

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.649
they'll stop I don't think so well maybe

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:20.420
eventually if you hang yeah who's it

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.570
helping I don't [ __ ] know I mean now

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.120
if you're it will if you own a chemical

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.440
company and you've been selling I'm

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.570
sorry how much it's just like how many

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.880
people are in on fluoride probably like

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.980
ten dudes they're getting rich off the

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.399
entire country for just for no reason

00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:39.829
like how much you try the price is

00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:41.390
probably locked in it's just an audit

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.709
just stuff you make it they probably

00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:44.630
don't even put it in anymore they're

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.800
probably like yeah give us a billion

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.000
dollars for all the fluoride were put in

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.100
the water and like okay cool but yeah

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.660
that was that was [ __ ] me up dude

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.660
yeah I gotta figure out Plum Island bro

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.120
with you wait till you look into that

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.500
so limes they were researching Lyme

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.560
disease I don't know probably they're

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.240
like how can we take down landscape if

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.410
there's all these there's all these like

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.029
how they were like there's all these

00:15:08.029 --> 00:15:10.940
[ __ ] bio bio weapon facilities that

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.579
just are terrifying and pointless

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.649
stateful well yeah I mean dude this if

00:15:15.649 --> 00:15:18.050
you don't that's a thing till ok this

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.640
one's not a bio you know we could say

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.140
this one's not about although they did

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.000
say again when you research viruses you

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.500
have to amp them up so you can kind of

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.699
observe them better and the thing is

00:15:25.699 --> 00:15:27.230
they amped up his virus according to

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.480
this video and then it got someone got

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.310
infected and the lady that was patient

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:32.930
zero the government of trying to killed

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:33.560
her

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.300
if you go on their website of the

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.160
researchers people who had been there

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.660
for years and left their BIOS are still

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.370
on there besides the one lead researcher

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.500
who just has totally disappeared and

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.270
then a guy came out again saying like yo

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.430
that was patient zero she died Chinese

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.050
government cover that up murdered the

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:53.480
guy was dead two days later yeah it is a

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.310
good excuse for a Thor Italian

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.570
government to just be like man that's

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.430
pandemics really somehow it's just

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.320
destroying all of our political enemies

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.760
yeah man

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.410
I think all of our political enemies

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.810
have a cult you just go around kill well

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.120
dude and now that so seeing what it's

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.120
capable of now I mean dude you say okay

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.370
say this one wasn't a bio weapon bio

I guess I'm okay

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.670
like if other if I was the only one not

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:56.990

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.000
you just like quarantined life

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.010

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:10.340
watching us an L yeah like seeing it not

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.630
being able to be a part of it and being

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.760

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.670

left on the floor and they made him

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.980

room

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.700

giant head for no reason it's probably

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:38.240
the only reason I'm alive now this goes

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.770
like a thousand years ago it was like

01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:41.710
kind of hot to have a humongous head

01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:46.760
walk and walk around I was talking about

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:53.510
the ice so the tightwads I think I was I

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:56.329
was afraid that the clubs were gonna be

01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:58.640
[ __ ] yeah how many clubs but all I

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.030
heard through the grapevine the tightwad

01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:03.589
grapevine that a couple of the tightwads

01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:05.119
are thinking about buying up all those

01:02:05.119 --> 01:02:07.940
tightwads reasons like watts are buying

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.500
up all the clubs that are closing it's

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.510
like there's still there's expansionist

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:12.079
tightwads

01:02:12.079 --> 01:02:14.990
yes yeah I know so our god is great God

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:16.760
first of all how many gods are going to

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.609
be open I was genuinely worried

01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:21.200
yeah that would [ __ ] suck dude oh

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.849
[ __ ] me what would you do I would make

01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:23.930
sure curious about this what would you

01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:25.339
do if it was just like for the next

01:02:25.339 --> 01:02:28.339
three years or like hey man you know say

01:02:28.339 --> 01:02:30.829
oh you know stand up for three years

01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:33.349
yeah what the [ __ ] would you do I would

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:37.369
probably try to I guess act with tires

01:02:37.369 --> 01:02:38.270
make tires

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:41.150
nice tires there's four or five of us we

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:43.839
just we're gonna do that anyway true

01:02:43.839 --> 01:02:45.859
this might be a thing of fire you can

01:02:45.859 --> 01:02:49.339
stand up out it's not there's no way

01:02:49.339 --> 01:02:51.980
it'll be good take stand about it's

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:54.079
gonna take out live music theater plays

01:02:54.079 --> 01:02:56.030
I call that [ __ ] sure I'll never let

01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:58.369
these reporting events I'll never let

01:02:58.369 --> 01:02:59.960
theater day it's not I think you're

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.980
gonna think this who's gonna kill

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.589
[ __ ] that no it's not gonna do it

01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:06.650
they they're also talking about

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:09.769
letting people write-off entertainment

01:03:09.769 --> 01:03:12.769
and restaurants again used to be able to

01:03:12.769 --> 01:03:14.119
like take clients out and entertain them

01:03:14.119 --> 01:03:15.200
and write that all off and I think

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.670
they're gonna put that back into effect

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:19.430
so that way whoa Oh that'd be sick it's

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:20.720
