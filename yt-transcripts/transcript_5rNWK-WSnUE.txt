00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.240
out while

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.680

alert if you haven't seen it

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.280
because if you see noah's breakdown

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.119

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.280
association

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.000
block captain is when somebody claims to

be in charge of the entire somebody

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.639
assumes power someone

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.479
it's the lowest form of political power

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.240
and it's it's it's autocratic there's no

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.199

the roast battle itself it was lemaire

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.240
correct me if i'm wrong you were going

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.720
for like a kind of a more like wwf

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.920
theatrical style

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.839
you tried to be meta

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.639
[ __ ] like at one point like halfway

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:58.000
through a roast battle i pulled out all

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.760
my head shots and i started signing them

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.720
and giving them to people

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.639
god i hate that i know it's the worst i

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.560
hate what you're saying i had one girl

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.079
i had a girl planted in the audience

00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:07.600
that came up and uh

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.360
um like i took her panties out of my

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.120
out of my pants and gave it back to her

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.399
you're doing magic out there oh yeah

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:16.639
dude

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:19.279
it's time to move home the magic show is

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.720
over

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.480
back to philly

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.560
well so the mayor was going up against

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.079
this guy and i it was a tight race i

00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:29.680
thought the guy to be honest lemay had a

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.440
slight edge on you guys

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.839
um so he the guy was legitimately

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:34.639
winning hold on

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:36.160

beezer attacks shoes

you on the uh if you

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.079
when you get fat enough you start

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:06.160
leaning in on shoes you start breaking

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:06.800
them inwards

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.120
right do you ever see that that's one of

beezers that's one of bizarre's favorite

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.720
targets if he sees a fat dude with

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.360

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.639
who he goes for dude

well these are you know it was like a

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.160
chain of events because there it

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.440
happened to be like a semi-black

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.240
audience

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.240
so when beezer went at the shoes and it

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.000
landed audience

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.959

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:07.679
walking

00:22:07.679 --> 00:22:09.520
literally straight past me to go to the

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.520
car i was sitting next to the door they

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.039

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:15.280
first off i had bombed that night and i

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.039
was outside already in the car like

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:19.840
[ __ ] came back in just to watch them

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.320

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.280
way way worse but they walked past me

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:23.919
and while

00:22:23.919 --> 00:22:25.440
wood was i think it was six that was

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.559
directly in front of me i was like

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.600
bobby rule goes on stage was like that

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.080
was good if you like a podcast that

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.919
sucked i was literally face to face with

00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:40.000
six just like

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.200
he dunked on him at the end

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.280
oh so then we get home this is where the

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.320
bomb it was

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.240
six six sort of came to terms with it

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.520
by the end of the night he was he was

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.880
feeling bad oh no because he'll just get

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.240
drunk wood is the type of guy that i

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.760
don't think about it for the next i bet

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.520
he's still thinking about it they

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.679
would had one of the funniest [ __ ]

00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:02.240
like one of those things that i'll just

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.520
i mean it might be too mean to even

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.039
bring up but there was a female comic

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:06.400
that was headlining the show and he was

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.039
like

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:08.559
she's going to go back to new york and

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:10.200
tell everybody

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.200
[Laughter]

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.640
yeah he thought his reputation was

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.880
tarnished from it um from the mashup

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.679
from the mashup

00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:22.400
so he takes bombing very seriously then

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.200
we're sitting

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.919
yeah he does yeah we're sitting in the

00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:27.520
living room back at the house and saving

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.960
private ryan's on

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.400
and it's like the opening scene and i

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.240
was like we hadn't addressed it because

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.159
it was very very serious how bad this

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:36.480

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:40.480
[ __ ] it the whole car ride home was

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.520

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.039
then we sit down we're watching the the

00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:48.559
opening scene of saving private ryan and

00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:49.760
i was like yeah this is like your guy's

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.880

upstairs it's me and wood on the couch

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.559
and then uh eventually wood broke and

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:02.080
just spazzed on me

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.600

but then they they did

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.960

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.559
pull the mare there which is when you're

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:26.480

00:27:22.159 --> 00:27:22.640
last

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.080
dude lemaire let a lesson be learned

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.159
from the last championship around

00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:28.080
when that one guy wouldn't accept his

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.919
loss there was a guy who wanted to do

00:27:29.919 --> 00:27:30.880
the the

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.760
end was gardini versus gardening rules

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.360
by the way gardening is a [ __ ] man

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.120
yeah gardening versus this guy from new

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.200
york who you know the guy who came out

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:39.760
asking

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.159
what illya asked him billy alaskan comes

00:27:42.159 --> 00:27:43.840
out and he uh

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.399
ilya alaskan he came out and was like i

00:27:46.399 --> 00:27:47.520
can't

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.240
so he should do war mode yeah for real

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:50.960
so

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.440
he came out and was like oh man i left

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.200
like a rashahana dinner or whatever for

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:55.679
this

00:27:55.679 --> 00:27:57.039
and immediately the host was like oh i

00:27:57.039 --> 00:27:58.080
don't tell anyone that he's like oh

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.279
you're jewish too and the host like yeah

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:03.200
but i kind of keep it to myself

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.880
so then he goes so the whole all my

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.159
feedback was just like i just really

00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:07.840
like seeing a strong gentile and you

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.480
know guardian

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.480
just constantly [ __ ] around but then

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.559
he legitimately did lose

00:28:12.559 --> 00:28:14.159
but he was like you know i think he was

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:15.279
just kind of [ __ ] around but there's

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:16.960
part of him that was like not trying to

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.960
accept it but he made a good joke of it

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.159
he was just like i can't believe i drew

00:28:20.159 --> 00:28:21.440
all the way down here to [ __ ] lose

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.640
his songs yeah that's funny he was a

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.480
that like my veins were throbbing in my

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.679
head

00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:25.360
and then i remember when shane farted

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.039
during there there was a

00:33:27.039 --> 00:33:29.679
remember ruby yeah so she had she was

00:33:29.679 --> 00:33:31.760
taping for comedy center she

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.159
showed up

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.440
so she showed up and in her defense she

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.080
probably was

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.519
because i think comedy central was like

00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:43.440
please can one woman be funny

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.360

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.200
across the country please

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.120
somebody sent us a storytelling picture

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.960
i think it was for uh

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.200
what's that ari's show oh uh this isn't

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.240
how yeah

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.039
so she set up a camera i think told

00:33:57.039 --> 00:33:57.919
everybody

00:33:57.919 --> 00:34:00.720
yeah at the open mic at a [ __ ] open

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.480
mic that she was filming this set for

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.600
comedy central

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.360
and it was like a 15-minute story so

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.200
they gave her a 15-minute spot

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.159
to tell this story at the raven what a

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:10.639
[ __ ]

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:13.440
wild choice wild choice but all the

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.200
comics stand in the back right next to

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.639
where her camera was

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:19.839
and she had been bombing for probably 10

00:34:19.839 --> 00:34:20.720
of the 15

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.800
yeah at which point i did in fact

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.960
unleash

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.760
a very hard fart like a very aggressive

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.119
lap the type of part that

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:30.560
you will get hemorrhoids from if you

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.040
keep push just pushing farts

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.240
and uh it it reached the stage in raven

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.359
which is crazy because

00:34:37.359 --> 00:34:38.960
that's a big distance that's big

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.399
distance it was crowded there's mute

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:41.760
there's a dj downstairs

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.079
so there's music i mean that far was so

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:45.839
loud that she stopped

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:48.079
the place goes nuts she's like who did

00:34:48.079 --> 00:34:49.200
that

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.639
the hardest laugh of the set which was

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.000
the best part we need to get that tape

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
from ruby i do i need that man i'm

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.440
trying to get the tape in my fart from

gas station oh you'll get into that

hopefully they filmed they did i think i

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.960

you're bombing as a comic just let one

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.640

um dude this this is the way that i

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.480
describe la to people

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.920
where it's like i feel like a lot of

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.359
people in los angeles they confuse

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:44.480
necessary bullying with intolerance

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.400
so it's basically like i heard that you

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.359
know what i mean so it's like you're

00:37:47.359 --> 00:37:49.040

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.240
school right you get

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.040
called a douche bag as you should and

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.680
instead of doing any sort of like

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.359
self-inventory turry or personal

00:37:57.359 --> 00:37:58.320
reflection

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.880
you move to the one place in the world

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.079
of course where it's cool to be a

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:03.359
douchebag

00:38:03.359 --> 00:38:05.200
you know what i mean yeah so it's just

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.560
like and then they have the [ __ ]

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.680
balls to look back

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.200

her time to go

00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:10.960
yeah sure so wait now because yeah i

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.680
worry about the supreme

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.839
i wasn't gonna now that the notorious

00:42:13.839 --> 00:42:15.760
rbg died you have to vote also i can

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.599
only imagine that there was like

00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:19.920
because she had to stay alive i can only

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.839
imagine there was some intern at the dnc

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:23.599
whose whole job was to just slap her

00:42:23.599 --> 00:42:25.280
across the face every time she starts to

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.079
like nod off

00:42:26.079 --> 00:42:27.680
that's true they were no they were for

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.040
sure trying to keep her alive for

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.720
another six months and she's just like

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.400
but she did die at the perfect time to

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.160
help get votes

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.160
true yeah that makes sense so you think

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.359
hillary could just kind of put a little

00:42:37.359 --> 00:42:38.160
pillow on her

00:42:44.079 --> 00:42:46.319
boat

or even liberal leaning supreme court

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.760

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.200
then he does the thing where he walks

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.119
around the stage like well that's it

00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:23.119

00:54:44.559 --> 00:54:45.760
place and you try to like

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.599
make friends you kind of get thrown like

00:54:47.599 --> 00:54:49.440
the first lifeline that's like tossed to

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.240

man i'm so autistic that sounds like

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.079
such a nightmare to go to a place where

00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:55.359
i don't know anyone and be like well so

00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:55.680

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.160
like make too many friends and then all

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.599

for me to

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.000
just fully embrace capitalism like the

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.319
worst form of capitalism which is

01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:49.680
franchises in the middle of america

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.680

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.240
everybody was just one guy by themselves

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.160

looked up once

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.079
and just dracula blasting while people

01:05:06.079 --> 01:05:07.680
were drinking bud lights that were like

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.000
48 ounces that's awesome yeah it was

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:10.799
actually nice

01:05:10.799 --> 01:05:12.319
well costco if you're going to get drunk

01:05:12.319 --> 01:05:14.640
at a tgi fridays in the mall of america

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.640
what's the song you're going to put on

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.240
the dragon is actually regular is

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.920
probably pretty sick i like when i go to

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.680
a jukebox i like to if they have that

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.760
biggie smalls album put the interlude of

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.680
him just having sex really loud

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.440
that's one of my favorite songs to put

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.960
on yeah and

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.599
or i like to do atlantis by donovan oh

01:05:31.599 --> 01:05:33.039
because this is that song of a guy being

01:05:33.039 --> 01:05:35.200
like in the odin times the atlantean

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.119
people they just talk about atlanta for

01:05:37.119 --> 01:05:38.480
like six minutes and then they go into a

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.839
chorus dude it's the funniest thing to

01:05:39.839 --> 01:05:40.799
put on a bar

01:05:40.799 --> 01:05:43.039
that's a good one yeah put on donovan

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:44.480
atlantis is a really good one

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.359
my go-to is uh night moves by bob seger

01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:48.079
just because

01:05:48.079 --> 01:05:49.760
everyone like because i've done it

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.359
before and i like watch the crowd and

01:05:51.359 --> 01:05:52.799
like everyone just kind of like nobody

01:05:52.799 --> 01:05:53.839
looks at each other but they just kind

01:05:53.839 --> 01:05:54.960
of do that thing where they close their

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.520
eyes and they're like

01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.680
that's a genuine nice thing to do just

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.680
like put on some night moves but

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.240
about this true i promise dracula is the

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.280
one dragula

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:08.319
is dragulo in that situation was so

01:06:08.319 --> 01:06:08.720
[ __ ]

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.680
i should have played the notre dame

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.039
fight song that would be pretty that's

01:06:11.039 --> 01:06:13.680
why i i do usually pick that

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.000
that's [ __ ] okay no it's very funny

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.839
at a bar to just go

01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:29.359
oh more human than human would be

01:06:29.359 --> 01:06:33.839
anything by rob zombie rules

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:37.750
