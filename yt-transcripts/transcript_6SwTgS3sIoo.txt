hi how are you I was looking on are the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.299
internet and I saw you were selling a

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:24.410
mannequin you're not selling a mannequin

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.290
shoot it says it's it says Gleneagles at

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:46.379
the bottom of it you're selling a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.510
picture of it or the actual mannequin

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.350
the actual mannequin okay so I have a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.730
few questions about the mannequin it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.480
looks here like it has a very nice

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.049
feminine physique would you say that it

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.210

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:22.290
what would you say like c-cups well I'm

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.729
going to need to know that information

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.640
because this is not going to be a public

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.829
mannequin anymore this is going to be in

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.689
my house and I'm going to attach things

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:57.719
to it and you do the math it would not

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.170
support the weight of a man now if I

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.930

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.950
top secret stuff going on over here

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.750
yeah cluding the launch of a brand-new

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.049
podcast inaugural episode this is the

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.629
very first episode this is this is

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.420
big-time dude history this is history

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.069
I give it five episodes how about you

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.420
fives a little ambitious I think with my

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.159
visit they will fizzle out after two I

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.510
think we're gonna get a lot of bad

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.090
reviews after one probably maybe give it

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.609
a shot again and realize that podcasting

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.489
is not for us but for now this is it or

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.470
this is the best this is top five of all

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.239
time this could be exactly because

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.030
though we'll see but yeah we're gonna

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.750

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.770
Hail Mary at the end of it about what

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.900
would you rather do would you rather get

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.230
shot in the head or 69 with your dad

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.940

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.400
The Osbournes The Osbournes were there

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.070

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.410
watch there they're good friends son

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.320
flounder and then toss out a joke about

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.300
you know 69 with their [ __ ] friend

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.310
well also the threat of the impending

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.199
threat of a gun to the head makes it all

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:25.110
that more violence perfectly so weird

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.959
Saul fantasy now you gotta let you suck

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:31.290
yeah yeah and and the amplifier too is

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.029
you have to be both have to finish

00:11:33.029 --> 00:11:35.490
exactly that's the horrific that's more

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.380
scarier than the gun you both have to

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.069
finish so this could take hours yeah

00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:43.019
hours straight of just you and your dad

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:45.839
sixty-nining just like sore necks and

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:50.459
just clenched jaws it sounded like two

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:52.079
old wives of each other like new next

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:54.959
tired so I was yeah I had a show in town

00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:59.519
in Harrisburg and my parents were

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.019
excited they haven't seen me do stand-up

00:12:01.019 --> 00:12:03.569
in a while they thought there I moved to

00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:04.889
Philadelphia they're like man he's

00:12:04.889 --> 00:12:06.690
really he's really working on becoming a

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.569
good stand-up comic and then they got to

00:12:09.569 --> 00:12:12.029
watch me bomb for like ten minutes

00:12:12.029 --> 00:12:16.829
and toss that one out and the funny

00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:18.000
thing was is everyone in the audience

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.579
knew me so it was all like my friends

00:12:20.579 --> 00:12:21.930
and [ __ ] from high school and like they

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.760
all knew my dad too and they all knew he

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.040
was sitting in the [ __ ] front row in

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.310
the middle of the front row and they

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.910
just got to watch me say that and Crum I

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.190
crumbled onstage when I said it to my

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.440
mom yelled my mom yelled and I thought

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.639
it'd be funny to tell her to shut the

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:41.850
[ __ ] up so your mom shut the [ __ ] up and

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.310
you proceeded to and plant the visual of

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.260
you and your father 69 and in front of

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.209
the Osborne's to the whole party it was

00:12:48.209 --> 00:12:50.329
[ __ ] hilarious James Bond together I

00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:52.889

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.149
drove separate because as soon as the

00:13:09.149 --> 00:13:10.380

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.550
been like holy [ __ ] that's that kid is

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:21.240
[ __ ] weird weird dude imagine I mean

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.250
forgive me if I'm wrong but like just

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.199

your way to work right now you're

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.000
probably questioning everything like

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.860
what why did I choose what I chose I

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.809
could be in the house around a poker

00:28:53.809 --> 00:28:56.450
table right now farting into a

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:57.820
microphone

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.460
yeah which is pretty fun I'm not gonna

actually you know it's nice my dad

00:29:03.999 --> 00:29:05.409

00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:08.919
[ __ ] get ahold of this how's your mom

00:29:08.919 --> 00:29:11.049
with computer she might hook him up he's

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:12.009
gonna listen he didn't want to hear

00:29:12.009 --> 00:29:13.929
himself yeah

00:29:13.929 --> 00:29:15.759
major but sometimes you just

00:29:15.759 --> 00:29:17.109
fast-forward to the part you're on yeah

00:29:17.109 --> 00:29:18.519
he'll probably listen the whole thing

00:29:18.519 --> 00:29:22.389
yeah oh listen to that and then I was

00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:25.029
gonna I'll tell this story cuz he's

00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:26.799
gonna want to hear this one cuz I'm

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:30.399
thinking it so every year in like from

00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:33.669
like six through like ninth grade my dad

00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:35.889
would take us me and like ten of my

00:29:35.889 --> 00:29:38.379
friends out to Notre Dame uh-huh

00:29:38.379 --> 00:29:41.830
to watch their [ __ ] spring game it's

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.570
like just a scrimmage in April and he

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.960
would bring like ten of us out in uh in

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.289
like a [ __ ] huge van like what are

00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:52.119

yeah huge wrote like rows and rows and

00:29:58.889 --> 00:30:02.169
he would bring these kids and we were on

00:30:02.169 --> 00:30:04.570
like this year was like the seventh

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.169
grade sounds great so we all just

00:30:07.169 --> 00:30:10.499

while they [ __ ] all right tell me what

00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:31.120
you're doing so I was trying to

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.799
interview people alive while they're

00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:34.179
taking a [ __ ] and see if I could get

00:32:34.179 --> 00:32:35.320

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:35.980
taking a dump

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.380
perfectly reasonable [ __ ] and I was it

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.419
to talk about stuff in like an anonymous

00:32:46.419 --> 00:32:47.830
setting when they're relaxed and taking

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.080
a dump and it feels more like a sexual

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:50.710
come on

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.960

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.000
but I won't stop I will get the answers

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.350
