00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.599
crowd

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.680
there's usually like a split second

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.360
while the crowd's processing what i just

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.439
said yeah and then it's just

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.840
you're a couple people like

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.479
then everyone starts laughing yeah but

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.079
that is a tough one

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.080
yeah it's impossible to figure out it

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.280
depends how old your dad is

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.720
if it's like if you're like for the sake

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.919
of argument let's say he can ejac

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.320
if you work it good enough

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.840
you both have to finish or you get shot

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.759
in the head can you like put him on some

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.120
molly or something so it feels extra

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.199
good for him no drugs or alcohol what

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.400
the straight sober dad 69 oh

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.479
okay you'd have to do it

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.840
do you get shot and not get shot in the

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.199
head

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.280
i don't think my dad's so into dying and

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.639
like his death and i think he'd be like

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.639
shoot me in the head i don't know yeah

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.160
you both have to agree too what if you

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.440
were like don't be [ __ ] selfish what

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.199
if you're like dude i'll i'll suck your

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.880
dick but your dad's like no you can't no

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.639
in this hypothetical your dad has always

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.960
wanted to

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.000
[Laughter]

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.600
that's fair because i just thought about

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.560
that you could have a split party thing

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.919
where then i guess you're dead you just

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:12.880
have to

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.880
face [ __ ] your dad's uh dead body i was

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.400
gonna say your dad would get shot you

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.080
don't have to get on top

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.000
damn that'd be tough dude that would be

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.400
really tough

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.919
i hope that never happens oh dude we got

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.039
a sponsor

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.160
okay i hope that never happened

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.440
oh dude that's what i was i don't know

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.800
we'll get this box

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.400
but i was listening to that rape of nan

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.919
king

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.120
uh

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.280
oh jocko podcast where jocko was reading

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.280
like the atrocities and they were like

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.800
and the japanese soldiers would hold

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.720

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.280
in his voice yeah that could happen

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.360
actually it did happen to some people

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.280

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.440
[ __ ] a family member at gunpoint

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.880
oh yeah it's not out of the realm of

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.479
possibility i guess i think if you were

butt

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.759

if you've been circumcised your penis is

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.240
like your hand the palm of your hand

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.840
it's rough you don't feel it dude this

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.720
is they sent you

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.639
they kind of do send some of this

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:16.800
so they do the stuff they sent me was so

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.720
funny because it was like

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.560
you're basically finish your pitch dude

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.240
okay so basically whatever start over

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.919
okay i'm starting over manhood

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:25.440
canada.com

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.240
if you're circumcised you got [ __ ]

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.520
yeah that's basically the whole thing

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.280
like if you're you go with your [ __ ] if

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.440
you got circumcised

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.360
here's what happened i got cirqued my

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.440
dick's been rubbing my jeans and [ __ ]

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.240
for

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.479
since time immemorial dude yeah so your

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:42.640
flaccid state your dick is always trying

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.800
to like it's too supposed to be so

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.399
sensitive that like your foreskin covers

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:48.080
it and this is what the guy said in the

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.160
letter it was like your dick's constant

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.240
or your penis he says

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.839
he's like your penis is constantly

00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:55.519
trying to like shrivel back to your

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:57.360
foreskin to be protected

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.519
but sadly it's gone dude that's where i

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:01.200
quote him he's like and sadly it never

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.279
finds its little nest

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.399
he said that

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:06.160
he said little mess or little whatever

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.000
the [ __ ] it is like sadly it never finds

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.440
this little flap of skin or whatever

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.080
[ __ ] oh my god that's worse than this

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.560
yeah it's pretty nasty but

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.240
so basically our

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.839
our circumcised dicks are just

00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:19.600
completely bludgeoned and mute to the

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.480
world

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.240
whereas if you're uncertain if you even

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.360
touch it like it's literally like

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.040
clitoris it's like oh it's too sensitive

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.839
yeah

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:27.920
so basically so i have one unsearched

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.640
friend he got a hand job in high school

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.160
and his nickname became everywhere

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.320
because he nodded everywhere because it

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.640
felt so good for him dude we used to

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.200
call him dt deformed tallywhacker

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.880
and now he's laughing dude now he's got

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.160
a long

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.399
[ __ ] weird dick yeah but dude that's

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:46.160
how it's supposed to be so we we're

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.000
literally like unix dude we're eunuchs

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.920
basically he listens to this he's gonna

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.640
touch me he should he would use it too

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.680
good for [ __ ] him dude because you

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.040
don't get to grow your i don't think you

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.320
get to grow to your full potential it

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.399
was funny though as kids like

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:00.000
anybody that was different

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.760
like he had he had a different dick than

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.080
all of us so we all made fun of course

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.200
you get an outcast when you get older

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.120
and just like whatever whatever dude

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.120
what your [ __ ] dick looks like

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.480
it is funny he probably woke up and

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.760
we're like

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.360
[ __ ] dudes take his weirdest [ __ ]

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.120
dude it is it does make it big well i

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.000
think it was one of those things where

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.320
we all saw it eventually really yeah

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.839
like you pee next to each other enough

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.440
because we were together he showed you

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.880
the end he showed you the annie and then

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.399
like you come to and you talk to another

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:26.399
friend like dude do you see his dick

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:28.399
it's weird dude we didn't know what the

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:29.839
[ __ ] was wrong with it

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:31.920
like he's got a weird dick then you guys

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.600
confront him about it back to pee

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.600
sometimes yeah yeah what can happen if

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.279
you're not circus is that your skin like

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.600
fuses overnight what because if you're

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.640
like leaking all night and you're

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.480
leaking out [ __ ] crap

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.000
it's leaking dude and then you're like

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.720
you go to pee and it just goes and pops

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.240
and it shoots out

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.600
so basically what the product that's

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.360

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.720
out afterwards

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.960

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.640
[ __ ] struck with at this point it's

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.840
gonna be [ __ ] [ __ ] dude

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.280
a club for white guys or anyone really

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.120
who wants to do who wants to practice

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.480
asian impersonations but seriously like

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.480
no [ __ ] if you laugh you're out so

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.320
you have like a whole thing like oh

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.559
welcome and if anyone laughs it's like i

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:46.720
mean you get escorted out and you see

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.960
who who can last the longest dude

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.720
imagine renting out like a radisson in

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.400
and just like a conference room dude

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.520
if you laugh dude you get pulled out

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.559
just

00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:00.080
like it each it's like the world series

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.159
of poker there's just it's just tables

00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:05.919
when you get like a meal it's like oh

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.559
everyone's doing it loud

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:10.720
and if you do it like you'd have like

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.320
like speakers and you have to like take

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.000
turns addressing stuff

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.360
and if you laugh you're out dude you're

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.799
[ __ ] you gotta leave last man stuff

00:22:16.799 --> 00:22:18.000
that's a great that's i mean that's

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.880
incredibly racist but that's a good well

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.960
but my that's my thing it's like it's a

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.799
serious practice that's why if you laugh

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.799
you're kicked out this is guys just one

00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:28.240
attention to see who can

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.760
no this is guys who want to work on

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.360
their accent i understand but it's like

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.960
if you wanted to like say there was like

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.679
an acting gig that pops up

00:22:35.679 --> 00:22:37.280
like some people work on irish acts like

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.200
the great wall or

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.640
the last samurai where you need to be a

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.360
white asian dude

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.240
[Laughter]

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.400
because in my head i was like well

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.559
i mean if i was like studying mandarin

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:50.080
i'd have to do the accent so what the

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.440
[ __ ] i switched language and all of a

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.280
sudden it's bad it's like come on

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.720
yeah well

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.720
you understand the difference i do i do

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.000
that's why you'd have to have utmost

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.440
sincerity that's why laughing's

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.200
punishable by your ex you'd have to you

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.480
know what would help with the laughter

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.720
is if you had a few asian guys like

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.840
stand

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.919
stand guard did they would be the

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:09.919
security guards maybe the guy's kicking

00:23:09.919 --> 00:23:11.440
so you have to make eye contact with

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.080
them when you laugh

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.120
they'd be the ones kicking you out yeah

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.280
[ __ ] have bamboo sticks [ __ ]

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.799
whipping people that'd be so funny i

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:24.320
used to be a gong for when people get

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.440
eliminated laughing

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:29.200
yeah man that would be so fun we should

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.960
do that with the radisson

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.240
we should run out of the conference room

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.799
everyone laughs immediately and leaves

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.400
how many people if we had seven to eight

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.320

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:39.919
listening blizzard was there saying just

murders blizznick went there and he was

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.960
he was telling me he was like dude he's

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.200
the funniest he's like so [ __ ] good

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.200
it's unbelievable that's blizzard dude

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.480

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.000
blizz man he was like he just walked up

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.679
there but i think he stayed and watched

00:28:51.679 --> 00:28:53.360
a bunch of his [ __ ] this weekend yeah

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.960
he's like dude i saw his thursday and

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.480
sunday he's like it was just too funny

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.760
man yeah

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.039
he was saying he was kind of burying

00:28:59.039 --> 00:29:01.279
normand a little bit

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:03.200
funnier it's very different yeah because

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.000
norman's very jokey yeah like it's just

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.559
joke joke joke which actually i mean

00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:09.679
it's one of those things where i don't

00:29:09.679 --> 00:29:11.840
like that style of like people going on

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.600
and essentially reading tweets yeah but

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.840
norman's so [ __ ] good at it and he

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.960
does it

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.440
so he dude he's like a machine it's an

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.600
hour of just straight [ __ ] jokes it's

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.880
really [ __ ] impressive he's like a

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.159
machine and then i've seen him before

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:28.080
where like he deviated slightly because

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.200
like someone was getting kicked out and

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.480
he was like

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.559
and everyone's like oh yeah yeah yeah

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:34.399
yeah when he he does break and do like

00:29:34.399 --> 00:29:37.679
slight improv yeah yeah he no he's a

00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:38.880
[ __ ] he is a machine it's pretty

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.039
undeniable yeah even if like that's not

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:43.679
the style i like but he does do jokes

00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:45.600
that are at least like

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.279
they're edgy yeah some of the [ __ ] he

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:48.720
gets away with saying it's like dude

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.240
what the [ __ ] yeah it's like because you

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.320
said it in a jokey way

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.200
yeah yeah yeah i called him last time i

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.120
caught him he was he was [ __ ] funny

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.919
yeah but uh we went to raven

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:01.360
and uh

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.880
i talked a lot of [ __ ] you're talking

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.840
some [ __ ] talkies comedy [ __ ] bro

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.120
and then i woke up the next morning like

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.360
why the [ __ ] would i do that who cares

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.120
yeah but it just sucks among comedians

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.720
to be like there should be some sort of

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.120
thing where it's just like you know

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.799
um you just can't hold [ __ ] against

00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:18.559
people yeah yeah i don't want to go too

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.399
far into it i hear you because it'll

00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:21.840
undoubtedly come back to haunt that's

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.360
just lame though i don't know it's just

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.039
like you gotta

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:27.360
yeah i mean it was all comics and i was

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.120
just up there trying to say [ __ ] up

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.600

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.680

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.040
[ __ ] pedaling metal i'm like i don't

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.240

you think of that on the way i used to

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.040
think that like on the way to school or

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.240
something i didn't want to do you just

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.760
be like man i should just fly right into

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.000
this [ __ ] just bridge

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.440
yeah

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.680
you don't though you don't do it dude

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.880
you know what actually is weird i was

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.240
thinking about the other day

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.359
is the so i was out on friday night we

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:25.040
went to a place called the concourse

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.240
dance bar

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.880
dude this place is it's the new spot so

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.920
this is my conclusion this is what you

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.599
were [ __ ] up i'm so [ __ ] stoned i

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:33.520
go to this place and it's a 90s themed

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.720
dance bar

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.920
and their whole thing is that they want

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.160
to take the pretentiousness out of clubs

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.680
so you go it's five bucks you walk in

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.040
and it's like a bowling alley dance

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.320
floor where there's like these really

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.160
cheesy graphics everywhere and they're

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.320
playing like nelly and dude it was

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.880
i had so much [ __ ] fun there but the

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.119
weirdest part is there was a ball pit

00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:52.800
and i was bugging the [ __ ] out the whole

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.760
time

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.040
well just it's weird because i've

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.520
thought this before it's weird people

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.960
i guess millennials which i found out

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.040
i'm basically on like the it starts at

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.400
86 which is me but people from like 86

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.520

like laying on a couch with like a

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.560
blanket up to his chin oh dude that'd be

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.760

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.119
them

00:41:51.119 --> 00:41:52.880
my dad didn't have any african-american

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.319
your dad's pure

00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:56.480
i mean dude i've i'm praying to get one

of those back it'd be like sub-saharan

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.079
it'd be so funny not everyone gets

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:02.640
african on ancestry.com you get you

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.400
usually get something something a little

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.000
spicy yeah that's what people are paying

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.280
for dude yeah of course they're trying

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.640
to pay to get a little spicy let's see

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.240
if you can get a press

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.920
south park

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.160
oh yeah it is it is

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.800
um oh my god but yeah that was weird for

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.160
me i was i was doing that i was looking

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.599
at that and i'm like

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:21.040
there's something really disturbing

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.000
about

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.560
30 year olds and their childhoods

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.040
just that's really weird yeah

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.160
and then i was telling you about this

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.440
too this is cracking me up i was talking

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.800
to gerbies about this on the way home

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.400
when i was driving them i'm not just

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.240
paying attention to my [ __ ] uh

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.960
daydreams lately dude oh god dude it is

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.560
so weird to think about what you

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.920
daydream about

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.200
because everyone is kind of walking

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.880
around like picturing themselves like

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.520
saving in a movie yeah exactly like my i

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.720
was telling you about it when i was

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.400
doing my like volunteer thing about how

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.920
i had to go work with like bad kids with

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.520
like criminal records

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.800
and how like

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.200
my my like i was imagining oh my god i'm

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.640
gonna go in there i'll probably drop

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.240
some wisdom on them and i'm like and

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.920
then one of them might raise their hand

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.400
maybe one of them kills me i'm like no i

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.280
survive and i go back and i beat the

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.640
[ __ ] out like no

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.040
i forgive them and no i have a cane i

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.400
walk the corridors and they're like oh

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.800
my god there he is then i got like i

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.560
come to a red light and i'm like okay

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.680
and i started driving i'm like what a

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.800
[ __ ] dude

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.800
dude yeah i don't have any of those i

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.640
have dude i non-stop and like if i

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.480
listen to a song i like it's like and

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.240
it's always ruined songs for me i like

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.520
listen to a song i like and like this

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.040
song is great and then i'll just imagine

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.720
myself playing it on stage a bunch of

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.359
people i'm like jesus you [ __ ] psycho

00:43:31.359 --> 00:43:34.640
just enjoy the song

00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:36.560
and then i'm playing it i'm like yeah

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.839
but it's not your song that's like

00:43:37.839 --> 00:43:40.160
slowly i'm like oh jesus this is gross

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.440
what i'm doing right now i don't think i

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.000
have that really not really i don't know

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.880
what it is i like i just i'll fantasize

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.240
all day about it's like that and then

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.520
like there's obviously the ones about

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.680
fighting like four people at once or

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.040
like coming out and being like what'd

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.390
you say to my girlfriend

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:57.440
[Laughter]

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.880
yeah i don't know man

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.240
i have them dude i'm trying to i'm

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.839
trying to dig into that you have to pay

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:03.440
attention because i tried to record my

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.200
dreams and that was just dude they're

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.720
too [ __ ] weird i'm not getting any

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.240
sort of cool insights out of them

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.200
because i started reading about the

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.800
collective unconscious and they're like

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.040
if you record all your dreams it doesn't

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.640
make sense but if you do it over a span

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.920
of like two months and then you can

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.200
piece them together and you'll see

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.119
themes that constantly come up

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:21.200
dude mine are so [ __ ] the only theme

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.280
that i've ever had pretty consistent is

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.400
punching someone in the face and it's

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.839
not hurting them

00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:27.440
yeah that's that's pretty consistent

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.480
when you're trying to fight in a dream

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.319
and you can't well i couldn't that

00:44:30.319 --> 00:44:31.599
didn't work for me so i'm like i started

00:44:31.599 --> 00:44:32.880
doing my uh

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.720
my daydreams and trying to figure out

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.839
because if you can figure out what you

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:37.280
daydream about all the time that's kind

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.720
of like you can figure out what you're

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.880
all about i'm just all about i'm a glory

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.079
hound dude that's what i figured out

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.599
well i think everyone is and yeah

00:44:43.599 --> 00:44:45.359
daydreams that's what i'm saying we were

00:44:45.359 --> 00:44:47.839
sitting there daydreaming like

00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:49.280
i wish i was a background some people

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.800
daydream about like sweet treats some

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.400
people probably like i can't wait to get

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:52.780
home

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.880
[Laughter]

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.960
just wings it's like

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.720
and then i'll put this on there because

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.319
do you think girls daydream about like

00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:02.240
[ __ ] walking the corridors with a

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.599
cane and limping and like showing

00:45:03.599 --> 00:45:05.280
everyone how tough you are that's what

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.359
i'm saying i could only imagine girls i

00:45:07.359 --> 00:45:08.480
could tell you what they dated you about

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.640
instagram yeah

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.960
like i wish i was my boyfriend was

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.119
holding my hand and i'm walking in front

you treat your women

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.960
i thought about that and i was like i

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.240

the point where i didn't i just figured

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.079
it was more anonymous in a city but if

00:53:16.079 --> 00:53:17.520
you go somewhere enough the staff starts

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:18.800

01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:23.680

it was but the first half hour yeah but

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.839
the fact that we had him on and didn't

01:00:39.839 --> 01:00:41.599
talk to him for a half an hour it's so

01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:45.280
funny just rambled about black panther

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.960
oh yeah he was great on there that [ __ ]

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.559

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.920

wormhole it's a marvel movie dude i mean

01:00:53.599 --> 01:00:55.200

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.520
whole thing of like why are

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.520
30 year olds so freaked out about you

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.599
know all that [ __ ] and then you add like

01:01:01.599 --> 01:01:03.359
the whole cultural identity [ __ ] now

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:05.200
it's like that's a gold mine

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.960
yeah that's dude it's damn it it's yeah

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.799
that's a double gold mine whoever was

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:11.040
the guy who decided to make that just

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.160
sitting there just like you know how

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.839

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.480
through the snow that guy's doing

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.000

peterson well the one thing like

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.960
o'connor for example or whenever they

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.000
they have a problem with them it's

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.920
usually the religion stuff

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.440
and it's like if you listen to what he's

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.119
saying about it i don't understand he's

01:06:55.119 --> 01:06:56.720
just saying these are

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.640
archetypes these storylines that we've

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.240
always used and there's a reason that

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.200
that's

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.200
in the human consciousness yeah and he

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.640
tells people that

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.799
people who are who literally interpret

01:07:06.799 --> 01:07:08.480
the bible is the word of god he says

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.640
like don't do that it's bad it's stupid

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.880
to do he loves the he loves the jk

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.640
rowling analogy he's like that's all

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.480
harry potter is well dude the story of

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.079
the bible when you watch his thing and

01:07:18.079 --> 01:07:19.520
he breaks down like the lion king and

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.280
breaks down pinocchio it's just dude

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.280
it's the [ __ ] i watched that in our

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.000
old house and it was like pinocchio

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.839
went off to go all he had to do was go

01:07:27.839 --> 01:07:28.880
to school and do what he was supposed to

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.799
do and he goes off and they're like hey

01:07:30.799 --> 01:07:31.680
you don't have to go to school you can

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.440
be in show business and he goes off and

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.720
he's like everyone's laughing at him

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.000
he's [ __ ] up and i'm just watching

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.599
this just like oh god he's here

01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:41.200
and then he goes to the salt he breaks

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.799
the whole story down then he leaves

01:07:42.799 --> 01:07:44.319
there and they're like dude show biz is

01:07:44.319 --> 01:07:46.319
rough you got to go to treasure island

01:07:46.319 --> 01:07:47.760
and he goes there and the the whole

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.960
point of treasure island is that they

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.799
turn you into mules into a beast of

01:07:50.799 --> 01:07:52.799
burden so if you're abandoning yourself

01:07:52.799 --> 01:07:54.400
into a beast of burning yeah you go to

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.920
the [ __ ] salt mine dude and then he

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.680
escapes it when you watch him break it

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.960
down i would just lay in my room at two

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.400
in the morning and be like oh my god he

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.559
said you thought you were a pinocchio

01:08:02.559 --> 01:08:04.079
yeah do you think he got a sheath for

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:05.570
his nose yeah

01:08:05.570 --> 01:08:08.640
[Laughter]

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.160
but that's when people [ __ ] [ __ ] on

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.680
him i'm like dude i guarantee you've

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.839
watched none of his stuff yeah i think

01:08:13.839 --> 01:08:15.200
it's trendy it's one of those things

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.719
where it's it's almost like the same

01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:19.040
reason i just said rick and morty

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.839
was gay true because his fans he does

01:08:21.839 --> 01:08:24.080
have like really annoying acolytes who

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.679
are they all try to talk like him too

01:08:25.679 --> 01:08:27.040
which is annoying they're like i mean

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.120
it's absolutely reprehensible and it's

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.480
like stop dude you heard him say that

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.319
bloody reprehensible yeah everyone tries

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:34.159
to talk like him and it's like that is

01:08:34.159 --> 01:08:35.359
there's that's a weird thing that's

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:37.440
popping up now where it's like

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.239

01:09:57.679 --> 01:10:00.159
and regurgitating patrice o'neal

01:10:00.159 --> 01:10:02.640
i think you're gay so what

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.600
i need a platform

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.800
just crazy dumb [ __ ] yeah it's weird man

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.640
because he would pontificate

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.440
constantly on page or

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.040
on stage interviews every day his

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.480
interviews are funny he's always got

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.600
like this

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.360
he knows more than everyone in the room

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.520
profound [ __ ] yeah but if you listen

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.159
he never gets anywhere a lot of the time

01:10:24.159 --> 01:10:25.760
yeah that's true a lot of time

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.320
like he does this unmasked with ron

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.480
bennington which is [ __ ] yeah i

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.000
listen to that i love it

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.840
but uh i just listened to it again today

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.080
yeah but he he there's several times

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.600
where people ask him a question he just

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.400
answers with just a random

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.320
three-minute [ __ ]

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.840
speech about nothing

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.360
that's the way to do it

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.800
but yeah i was

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.480
feeling bad because

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.080
every yeah never mind i don't want to

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.199
get into stand up every time i talk

01:10:53.199 --> 01:10:54.880
about stand up on this i end up just

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.880
being like oh my god i'm so gay

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.400
why well

01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.199
why

01:10:59.199 --> 01:11:01.600
yeah well first off because i'm nothing

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.920

01:11:06.239 --> 01:11:08.320
and it's just i'm in a spot where it's

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.840
just frustrating and that's what it's

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.440
always going to be

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.960

that it's like a never-ending video game

01:11:16.719 --> 01:11:18.320
dude it's like even if you get something

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.440

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.239
sold cars before that yeah and it was

01:16:28.239 --> 01:16:30.560
like that's a sick gig it's like 60 70

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:33.360
000 a year that's awesome easy

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.000
it's not trying 12 hours a day too

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.520
sometimes

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.880
that's pretty sick but i mean if that's

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.040
your job who cares that's not bad at all

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.880
yeah but uh you need to talk [ __ ] all

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.719
day and [ __ ] with people if i sold one

01:16:44.719 --> 01:16:46.320
car i was done for the day i would just

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.800
walk around i would leave for like three

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.080
hours

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.920
i mean i was a bad i was a bad employee

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.480
i'm definitely a horrible employee 60

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.080
just about whatever i do

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.520
yeah

01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.679
but that's tough to take orders dude

01:16:59.679 --> 01:17:01.760
it is i can't take orders of people i

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.280
can't take orders at a job unless i

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.600
really respect the person 100

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.360
so if i like was i like would work for

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.560
my dad and my uncles and i'd be like

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.080
okay then like i worked for some like

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.199
dude two years older than me and i'm

01:17:11.199 --> 01:17:14.000
like dude [ __ ] you ugh or if it's just a

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.679
totally meaningless job

01:17:15.679 --> 01:17:17.520
yeah like like selling switching

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.800
people's cable

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:19.840
yes

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.520
i can't care about this

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.120
there's nothing i can care about no

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.800
that's true especially with sales i feel

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.080
like if you're selling something that

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.080
you actually like it's so much easier

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.199
but if you're like

01:17:29.199 --> 01:17:30.480
i'm gonna switch your cable it's gonna

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.679
be cheaper for three months then you're

01:17:31.679 --> 01:17:34.080
gonna get [ __ ] crushed with fees

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:36.159
that's tough god it sucks for whoever's

01:17:36.159 --> 01:17:37.360
listening to this right now because they

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.320
definitely

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.400
not most not everybody i mean that's why

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.480
people have jobs that it's just like

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.719
this is pointless yeah but it also

01:17:44.719 --> 01:17:46.560
depends to what like you got going on

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:47.920
yeah if you have kids you want to make

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.679
money and have a family exactly if you

01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:51.520
have kids it's like

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.199
you know that i think that existential

01:17:53.199 --> 01:17:54.560
angst kind of goes away as soon as

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.080
you're like you're [ __ ] yeah it's

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.679
like i'm making money for their for that

01:17:57.679 --> 01:17:59.199
exactly now you have a reason though

01:17:59.199 --> 01:18:00.880
that helps you we don't have that reason

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.320
dude you're just sitting there tapping

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.239
the [ __ ] tapping the keys and you're

01:18:04.239 --> 01:18:06.239
like dude

01:18:06.239 --> 01:18:07.760
that's what i did selling cars like

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.960
there were guys i worked with that had

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.880
families obviously and they crushed it

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.159
and they're like this is a great job

01:18:12.159 --> 01:18:14.239
yeah but i had i i was just making a ton

01:18:14.239 --> 01:18:15.840
of money doing nothing yeah just eating

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.520
[ __ ] just a strip club dude yeah i

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.960
was going getting wings at the strip

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.480
club i was like i was just sitting there

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.159
like i should go to spain

01:18:22.159 --> 01:18:23.600
that was a good movie i would read a

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.880
book every day i would just sit there

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.239
and read the entire day that's so

01:18:26.239 --> 01:18:28.159
[ __ ] it was a sick job but it sounds

01:18:28.159 --> 01:18:29.440
pretty tight

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.280
it resulted in me going to spain and

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.800
literally never having money since yeah

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:35.600
[ __ ]

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.440
six it's tough to get it's been poor for

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.120
five years now it's nice to get old

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.760
enough to look back and have like a

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.120
a good enough zoom on your life to

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.120
realize like how badly you [ __ ] up i

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.960
do it all the time we're like

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.480
i think about like how much money i

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.719
spent on my wedding and i'm like man i'd

01:18:50.719 --> 01:18:52.480
be nice to have that [ __ ] back again

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.080
that'd be nice not to got [ __ ] arm

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.280
wrestled into spending a bunch of money

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.120
you know i'm not getting expensive like

01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.360
i get old enough to be like

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.800
man i could have avoided that with like

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.520
maybe one uncomfortable conversation

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:06.080
i was i was i remember i was because i

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.480
got out of college and sold cars so just

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.000
like out of college that was the first

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.760
job i even applied to

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.120
because my cousin worked there yeah

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.120
hooked it up i just went and sold cars

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.560
and i was like oh it's so easy to make

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.480
money who the [ __ ] doesn't i was like

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:19.920
yeah i just got out of college and made

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:22.159
60 000 selling [ __ ] hondas it was

01:19:22.159 --> 01:19:24.000
easy so like when i left for spain i

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.040
remember

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.320
the teachers over there like what are

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.360
you gonna do when you go back i was like

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.600
i don't know i'll [ __ ] find something

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.239
i get back i'm hawking bathtubs

01:19:32.239 --> 01:19:34.719
[ __ ] selling nothing

01:19:34.719 --> 01:19:37.600
crying just that's so [ __ ] funny well

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.600
you're probably a sick car salesman i

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.520
was good at that yeah

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.520
to people that were not [ __ ] idiots

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.199
yeah that's true if i was like i would

01:19:45.199 --> 01:19:46.719
always be like look this is the cheapest

01:19:46.719 --> 01:19:50.239
price yeah i'll try to get i don't care

01:19:50.239 --> 01:19:51.760
i don't care what you spend i don't want

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.760
you to spend money yeah i feel bad if

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.440
you spend more than you have to yeah and

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.040
people would be like ah he's a he's a

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.360
shyster he's lying i'd be like all right

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.040
i can leave yeah get the [ __ ] out dude

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.719
okay i got a book to read dude that's

01:20:02.719 --> 01:20:04.480
when i did the cold calling i remember i

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.600
was supposed to call and get all the

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.520
information from like

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.000
i'd have to call an i.t company and ask

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.840
for like the i.t leader whatever [ __ ]

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.520
it's called the ceo

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.120
and be like i want to just get their

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:18.000
secretary and like so i uh i i spoke

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.679
with him i think six months ago are you

01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:21.440
guys still using that dell server i'd be

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.239
like

01:20:22.239 --> 01:20:23.600
i was taking wild guesses because you're

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.120
supposed to piece together what they had

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.880
and how old it is so then when it goes

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.719
like a server lasts maybe it's seven

01:20:28.719 --> 01:20:30.400
years so if they would say like it's

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.159
five years old you're like you put them

01:20:32.159 --> 01:20:34.480
you'd sell that information company

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.600
and uh

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.960
i just got to the point where i'm like

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.159
dude

01:20:38.159 --> 01:20:39.440
if you just tell me these five things

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:41.199
i'll take you out of this list forever

01:20:41.199 --> 01:20:42.560
and no one will ever call you from here

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.159
and then that starts to work and [ __ ]

01:20:44.159 --> 01:20:45.440
yeah they're just they're like dude

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.600
you're not allowed to do that

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.040
i was like dude i hate doing this it

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.520
sucks just tell me what i need to know

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.120
i'm literally i'm supposed to get seven

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.280
questions but five passes yeah and

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.040
they're like yeah bro you know i started

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.440
getting in trouble soundcloud

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.719
i got in trouble selling cars because i

01:21:00.719 --> 01:21:01.840
would go into the office and get the

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.480
invoices that we paid for the car i'd be

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.239
like this is what we paid for it you can

01:21:06.239 --> 01:21:08.320
probably get pretty close to this damn

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:09.440
yeah

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.560
they were like why are you always in the

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.600
office i was like i don't know man

01:21:13.679 --> 01:21:15.679
that's a sick move yeah

01:21:15.679 --> 01:21:16.880
like just showing them the actual

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.719
invoice be like here's exactly what we

01:21:18.719 --> 01:21:19.920
paid for so you'd show them how much

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:21.040
you're going to make

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:21.920
yeah

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.880
like look this is what we're going to

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.960
make that's a good way of doing it yeah

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.880
there's no that's how i felt that's the

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:29.440
only way i felt justified with it like

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.440
to literally show everybody everything

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.640
yeah cause they're dude they're they

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.640
play games because i saw dudes that were

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:35.360
just

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.880
butt [ __ ] customers oh yeah man and

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.800
you make a ton of money but so much but

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.239
i couldn't justify that because again i

01:21:40.239 --> 01:21:41.840
didn't have a family so it's like am i

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.239
going to make an extra 400 on this deal

01:21:44.239 --> 01:21:46.560
and have some couple that i've kind of

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.400
befriended at this point spend five

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.080
grand extra

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:52.000
so that i get like 40 bucks more on my

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.960
paycheck yeah it's real [ __ ] up okay

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.400
so they're not breaking off they're not

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.000
like showering the glops on you if you

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.600
like if you they're not being like

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.120
here's what we want if you get extra

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.800
just like you know we'll split it up no

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.199
no it's like if you sell certain type of

01:22:05.199 --> 01:22:06.080
insurance

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.719
get like 100 200 but they're paying that

01:22:08.719 --> 01:22:10.239
like each payment it's like twelve

01:22:10.239 --> 01:22:11.679
thousand dollars yeah yeah it's

01:22:11.679 --> 01:22:12.880
ridiculous

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.920
and you're selling something you're

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.840
selling them [ __ ] like mud flaps and

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.920
or mud guards and like accessories that

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.360
are like 500

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.600
dude that's the one thing my ex-wife

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.560
when she went to buy cars was like

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:27.520
an absolute monster buying them like she

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:29.520
would get people to the point where like

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:30.880
she would get a salesman like that on

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.080
the line of like all right y'all this is

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.239
awesome isn't that i have this and that

01:22:34.239 --> 01:22:35.760
and then she would be like

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:36.880
all right and as soon as they're ready

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.080

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.440
the life of the car and they'd be like

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.960

paper so this guy's like salivating and

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.480

01:24:23.679 --> 01:24:25.520
concrete pillars and i'm like so if

someone comes in here and takes it out

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.320
i'm gonna creep around the pillar like

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.719
of going stopping a school shooter or

01:24:30.719 --> 01:24:33.040
even like terrorists and like grabbing a

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.480
machine gun off someone and then it's

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.159
mowing down like a group of terrorists

01:24:36.159 --> 01:24:37.920

had six o'clock in the gym bench press

01:24:43.199 --> 01:24:44.560
and be like i'd hide behind that pillar

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:47.040
and i'd like those [ __ ] up yes

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.360
constantly that's so fun yeah any time

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.360
i'm at uh it was definitely when i was

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.360
in school when i was in college i would

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.280

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.280
you do someone came yeah yeah yeah and

01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.800

in like a public

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.920
place where i think it could like where

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:03.600

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.679

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.639
piece of my mind dude i would say you're

01:25:08.639 --> 01:25:10.639
not coming in here and treading on me

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:12.320
and my friends well i'm like always

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.520
hiding behind the pillar and then like

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.960
you know you let him go and as soon as

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:18.000

stealth like i gotta go just i'm s

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:27.040
i'm just

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:29.600
like [ __ ]

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.679
like nick cage and conair

01:25:31.679 --> 01:25:33.120
getting shot in the arm and just keep

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.560
walking well there was that there was

that professor i forgot this guy's name

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.000
i think he was like a concentration camp

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.320
survivor and then he was a teacher after

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.239
that and then people came to i think he

01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:44.000
was doing the virginia tech shooting and

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.600
he leaned against the door and told all

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.719
the students to get out the window and

01:25:46.719 --> 01:25:48.080
they just [ __ ]

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.440
lit him up they have like a statue of

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.280
him there he was like 75 years old he'd

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.719
been in the concentration camp he was

01:25:52.719 --> 01:25:54.719
like damn [ __ ] it dude whatever and

01:25:54.719 --> 01:25:56.000
stood in front of the door and they just

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.360
dude he's like get out of here and block

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:58.320
the door and they just shot through the

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.239
door and put an idiot people jumped out

01:26:00.239 --> 01:26:03.360
he's a [ __ ] hero dude he's 75 75 year

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.120
old man with a bunch of put a [ __ ]

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.320
desk in front of the door and i would

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.920
have slowed it down more than a [ __ ]

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.760
geezer that's true yeah but he was a

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.440
[ __ ] concentration cam jewish dude

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.280

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.320
pounds of [ __ ] bags of salt

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:19.040
he's a hero dude that's a dumb hero

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.880
yeah i mean most heroes are [ __ ] dumb

01:26:24.239 --> 01:26:26.639
you're 75 and the opportunity to die

01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:28.480
like that arises you got to take it

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.600
that's the best way

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.880
like you're saying it was totally

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:32.400
ineffectual he probably just like opened

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.610
the door

they heard you say you rushed in the

01:32:56.639 --> 01:32:58.400
[ __ ] school dude they're like

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.880
the fact that trump said that is just

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.199
it's crazy i mean remember when wahlberg

01:33:03.199 --> 01:33:05.040
said that about 911

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:06.400
he's like i would have [ __ ] rushed

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.840
the cockpit and even then it was like

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.920
dude shut the [ __ ] up yeah don't say

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:11.360
that yeah

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.960
i mean it's such a that's like when you

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.480
get if if you've ever been robbed at

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:15.679
gunpoint and you tell your friend

01:33:15.679 --> 01:33:16.880
they're like dude i would have [ __ ]

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.239
grabbed his arm and it's like no you

01:33:18.239 --> 01:33:20.159
[ __ ] wouldn't have dude but the fact

01:33:20.159 --> 01:33:22.560
of trump rushing in there it's like

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.600
him even saying that it's like

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.719
it's like almost makes me want to put it

01:33:26.719 --> 01:33:28.000
to the test

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.520
maybe it will someone should like

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.520
simulate olympus's phone and videotape

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.600
him to see what he does he's not [ __ ]

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.199
russian dude no he's hiding he's gonna

01:33:35.199 --> 01:33:39.199
be you [ __ ] idiot dude if he rushed

01:33:39.199 --> 01:33:41.440
trump daddy would be a king

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.520
if we tried to fake olympus fallen him

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.040
and he ended up [ __ ] beating the [ __ ]

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.800
out of the russian terrace there's no

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.960
way dude he'd be the dictator yeah

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:50.480
that'd be the end i would i would

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.400
support him he's must be getting so much

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.600
[ __ ] right now what were you about to

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.040
say

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:58.400
uh oh the when the story came out about

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.159

school shooting yeah

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:03.360

[ __ ] coward yeah

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.239

more or less you got the president

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.400
coming on and being like yeah that was

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:19.600
just wasn't there like three of them

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:20.960
that didn't go and apparently there were

01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:22.320
like three other guys that were like

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.840
apparently though the chief told him to

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.920
stand or no excuse me someone said that

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:28.480
may have been orders of like stand down

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:30.560
i don't know because the police

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.760
went on and was like we're gonna

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.280
investigate it because

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:36.000
that's unacceptable okay so it sounds

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.080
like i mean

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.199
it sounds like they were like that's

01:35:39.199 --> 01:35:40.560
where it starts getting weird where it's

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:42.159
like wait why did those guys stay out of

01:35:42.159 --> 01:35:43.520
the building and someone tell them to

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:44.719
stay out of the building and why do they

01:35:44.719 --> 01:35:47.199
ignore all the [ __ ] people like dude

01:35:47.199 --> 01:35:49.360
if i go into school if i was in if

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.199
like anymore in school if you like make

01:35:51.199 --> 01:35:53.360
a hit list you they pull you the [ __ ]

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.560
out of there so if people start

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.760
suspecting that like you're taking

01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.600
pictures with guns and [ __ ]

01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.360
i don't know how that went unnoticed

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:00.880
yeah dress because the schools take that

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.719
[ __ ] you're taking pictures with guns

01:36:02.719 --> 01:36:04.480
and you're very pale

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.400
yeah dude that's when it's terrifying

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.719
time to get some authorities involved

01:36:08.719 --> 01:36:09.440
yeah

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:11.199
i watched the system actually work once

01:36:11.199 --> 01:36:12.800
if you're like a hot dude that's like

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.280
wearing a hunter's hat you got like a

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.639
dog with you in a truck and you're

01:36:16.639 --> 01:36:18.400
taking pictures of guns that's sick

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:21.280
totally fine if you're super pale

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.600
and like porcelain skinned

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.560
well that's what they're gonna have to

01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:26.800
start doing i i was uh actually my mom

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:27.840
didn't really like it but i was telling

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.679
her i was gonna start selling targets of

01:36:29.679 --> 01:36:31.199
like kids like brushing their hair out

01:36:31.199 --> 01:36:32.400
of their face

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:34.960
just like super nerd targets dude oh my

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.320
god dude

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:37.440
for

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.199
for who just for the new teachers dude

01:36:39.199 --> 01:36:40.480
the armed teachers oh you're saying

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.239
those would be the school shooters yeah

01:36:42.239 --> 01:36:44.400
i thought you were saying like no no no

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.440
i'm saying like you they're going to

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:47.280
sell targets of like a goth just kind of

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:48.719
like crazy they're not

01:36:48.719 --> 01:36:51.199
just autistic kids yeah i know it's all

01:36:51.199 --> 01:36:53.199
like lonely dudes that love jordan

01:36:53.199 --> 01:36:54.639
people it's really sad no it's not dude

01:36:54.639 --> 01:36:55.840
they definitely peterson has probably

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.119
stopped a couple of these things dude do

01:36:57.119 --> 01:36:58.639
you think probably

01:36:58.639 --> 01:37:01.760
i don't think so i mean these are like

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:02.800
i mean he actually talks about the

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.159
combine shooters

01:37:04.159 --> 01:37:05.520
oh yeah about how yeah yeah he's like

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.040
they're they're not even in the game so

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:08.719
they bloody well they flip the board

01:37:08.719 --> 01:37:10.080
yeah exactly not even a piece of the

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.440
game yeah

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:12.880
uh people need him dude if i was a

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.880
liberal hack comic i would probably make

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.280
a joke about how

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.440
even uh even a white school shooter the

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:22.080
cops are still like don't shoot him

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:22.880
yeah

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.960
that's that's the that's the easy thing

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:27.119
they stay off the school shooting stuff

01:37:27.119 --> 01:37:28.719
pretty hard no they hit school shooters

01:37:28.719 --> 01:37:30.000
oh it'll be like

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.679
yeah i guess so

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:33.760
true if i wanted a sick liberal hot take

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.199
i'd be like of course the cops didn't

01:37:35.199 --> 01:37:37.119
shoot him he was white that's how easy

01:37:37.119 --> 01:37:39.360
here's a video of tamir rice yeah that's

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.080
how he's 9 000 retweets yeah that's how

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:44.400
easy that is you're right yeah

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:45.199
but

01:37:45.199 --> 01:37:46.239
amen

01:37:46.239 --> 01:37:47.760
dude put your dick shield on dude and

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.119
lower your head

01:37:49.119 --> 01:37:50.320
that cop

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:53.280
when those shots went off it's just like

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.960
[ __ ]

01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.560
i mean you gotta [ __ ] go of course

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.560
you have to but

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.159
i mean i hear you there's still that

01:38:00.159 --> 01:38:02.000
part that i mean i have my daydream but

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.440
yeah if someone came in the drexel gym

01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:05.119
and started firing no idea what's gonna

01:38:05.119 --> 01:38:07.840
happen [ __ ] man there's no way i've i've

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.520
fully looked at it i'm like there's

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:10.560
you're trapped in here i mean

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:12.080
unfortunately this is exactly what trump

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.560
said but he was like you never know

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.480
until you're tested but he was like i

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:18.000
would hope i would go in even if i

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.360
didn't have a weapon and he said i don't

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.560
know why he goes i know a lot of people

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:22.080
would do and also in this room i would

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.440
hope everyone would do this they were

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:25.199
[ __ ] like gentlemen so the speech was

01:38:25.199 --> 01:38:27.199
yeah all right i'm backing off a little

01:38:27.199 --> 01:38:29.360
that's exactly what everyone thinks

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:30.960
yeah but it's just funny to hear it from

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.199
him his [ __ ] old rich [ __ ] ass yeah

01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:34.480
as the president is like dude you're not

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:35.920
fighting anybody yeah and it's like what

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.360
do i need to say right now it's like i

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.119
would have went in it's like more or

01:38:39.119 --> 01:38:40.719
less it's like dude you guys don't say

01:38:40.719 --> 01:38:42.159
that i know

01:38:42.159 --> 01:38:43.920

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.320
yeah

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.800

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.719
and shoots up another school yeah and

01:38:52.719 --> 01:38:54.719

01:38:54.719 --> 01:38:56.560
like i was in on it the whole time i

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:58.880
doubt it dude i doubt it but

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:02.400
[ __ ] it might lead them to it be like or

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.159

01:39:04.159 --> 01:39:05.360

somebody's getting shot

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.920
himself probably

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.600
i couldn't take that dude

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.440
if someone if the country [ __ ]

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:17.199
scoured me on that level with that

01:39:17.199 --> 01:39:19.040
amount of blood

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.719
on the table dude

01:39:20.719 --> 01:39:23.040
kids you didn't stop a [ __ ] school

shooting jesus christ man

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:27.760
uh

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.679
yeah that's the ultimate coward move

01:39:29.679 --> 01:39:31.679
dude sitting outside the doors i mean

01:39:31.679 --> 01:39:33.440
you got one job dude

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:35.360
99 of being a cop sitting on your

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:37.600
[ __ ] ass and not really doing [ __ ] oh

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:38.880
and it's like dude

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.960
you gotta [ __ ] go in there

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.440
that's the thin blue line dude that's it

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.520
that's what it's all about jesus christ

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.520
i love this i love the cops and the

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.199

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:55.800
last responder dude

01:40:04.639 --> 01:40:06.080
one more thought about that guy there

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.280
was definitely if he worked at that

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.960
school every day there was definitely

01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:10.800
hot chicks that he the the high school

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:12.000
chicks he could have saved him he could

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.600
have saved him

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:15.119
think of those hot chicks he saw every

01:40:15.119 --> 01:40:16.960
day that was like man what would i give

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.880
that's i could say for sure i'd went in

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:20.560
there now like some hot [ __ ] puerto

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.880
rican 17 year old chick in there i would

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.880
have taken my shirt off and it's been

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:26.320
like i would have ran in their shirt or

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.600
stupid put your tie over your head

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.239
yeah was it so [ __ ] up dude this is

01:40:32.239 --> 01:40:33.679
what like the

01:40:33.679 --> 01:40:35.600
there's been a good amount of them yeah

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.600
so now it's like i i literally school

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.280
shootings are just shootings in general

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:40.800
excuse me

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.000
there's been a columbine i remember

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.600
being like whoa yeah and then it was

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:44.960
like huh

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:47.119
again now it's like

01:40:47.119 --> 01:40:48.560
i was i don't really read the news and

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:50.080

all right [ __ ] not another one

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:55.760
makes sense

01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.960
yeah the guy that's like the biggest

01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:58.480
talk about this now is a guy not going

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.560

01:41:14.159 --> 01:41:15.920
blocked by cnn

01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:17.679

high school senior

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:29.119
