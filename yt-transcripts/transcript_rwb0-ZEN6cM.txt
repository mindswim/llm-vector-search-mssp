00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.640
it was always funny to have guests on

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.920
that were from philly and be like

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.440
uh right before we went on being like

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.400
you know you're banned from good good

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.200

hey we're live just like right before we

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.200
started

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.720
that's it's funny too to be like we

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.239
didn't we didn't mean that wasn't for

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.440
you sure why are you making that all by

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.760
yourself it's like oh hey new rule this

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.239
thing that we would never listen to yeah

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.360
if you're on your band

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.720
yeah they they tried to say that that

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.360
wasn't they weren't coming after me

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.400
they were like that was just the thing

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.560
it's like dude they instituted that rule

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.200
when my show started

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.560
i think i might have had something to do

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.480
with it gotta weird you out that was

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.879
weird

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.800
be directly opposed on that level where

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.640
it's like i don't even talk to what

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.480
yeah what are they doing yeah are you

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.239
ever going to drop the dots on them

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.640
no don't worry about them okay now the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.319
dossier it could come at any moment

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.720
okay that can come at any moment just

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.319
the atom bomb dude yes we all live in

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.760
feet we all interfere with the dogs

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.519
yeah once once they're on you know

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.680
shakier legs i you know there's rumors

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.400
going around

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.080
shaky legs i don't know i don't know we

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.000
should probably stop speculating

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.239
true okay um did you ever get into the

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.480
downfall of opening it like there's a

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.760
i don't know if it's a whole subreddit

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.599
but there's a whole youtube video

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.920
yeah the title that's beige frequency oh

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.040
is that what that is the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.560
weird world of anthony cooper that's

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.920
what you're talking about you know they

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.319
weren't

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.400
they weren't friends for like 14 years

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.000
while at the end they weren't friends

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.840
no yeah for like each other yeah yeah

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.159
that's crazy no i don't know anything

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.440
i'm listening

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.720
yeah they didn't like each other yeah

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.560
that's [ __ ] up yeah and the whole

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.480
thing just fell apart

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.400
that's awesome i mean well anthony got

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.959
fired and then opie kept doing the show

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.200
with jim norton and i think he got that

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.799
was a little strange

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.040
right so what i don't

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.280
but what's going on it always bothered

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.799
me that they didn't the scene didn't

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.799

subreddit i only saw

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.480
so apparently some lady just did a uh

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.839
she pretended to be like i'm doing like

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.360
a college study or something and then

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.120
she was like actually i'm from buzzfeed

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.839
and i'm [ __ ]

00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:26.240
roasting fem cells and just like turn it

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:33.760
nasty gross do you think femme cell is

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.399
fourth-wave feminism

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:39.200
i don't think i i think it's uh i don't

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.720
think they have a choice

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.320
that's you know what do you mean they

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.920
don't have a choice well they're ins

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.880
they're

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.440
they're cells yeah so that's i think

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.279
they're you know they're in a prison

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:51.120
perhaps by their own design but they

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.560
they're not excited about it yeah of

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.519
their mind

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:55.040
there's a lot of yeah there's a lot of

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.440
crossover between like heart involuntary

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.519
celibacy so if the found if they were

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.519
intentionally celibate as feminist then

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:04.240
yeah probably it was it'd be something

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.160
but the thing about femi don't oh yeah

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.519
you hate women go ahead no i don't

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:10.160
hate women women i feel like women get

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.120
to choose

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.600
sex though so the the point of that very

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.639
intelligence

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:18.079
i love you women get to choose sex

00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:21.120
women evolution women get to decide a

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.040
lot the track of humanity

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.320
like it's not like you don't agree

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.880
that women get to decide that the way

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.720
the course of the neck like the

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.600
like the neck the next no the the next

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.320
set

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.320
step of like growing as people like

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.000
evolving they just they see what's cool

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.680

the way they say it's like a blind kind

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:58.160

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.600
women brain at large yeah

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.279
and they're and it makes no sense we

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:05.760
don't get it and they're not choosing

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.120
they're not choosing to keep the lineage

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.000
of anime alive

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.880

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.280
were shaming him

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.119

00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:08.400
dude yeah yeah

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.000

[Laughter]

00:56:56.839 --> 00:56:58.400

you to do yeah how'd it go

00:57:01.839 --> 00:57:03.760
it uh we didn't do it because hillary

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.480
damn yeah what do you think about people

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.799
that cried when trump won that was that

00:57:10.799 --> 00:57:11.200

that's dumb that's dumb that's dumb i

00:57:13.839 --> 00:57:14.480
guess

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.079
that's over dramatic for real so you're

00:57:16.079 --> 00:57:18.640
not gonna vote

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.839
you don't like bernie i if i was to vote

the air mattresses have become sealy's

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:40.319
in trump's economy

00:57:40.319 --> 00:57:43.119
yeah that's like the only reason i would

00:57:43.119 --> 00:57:43.520

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.839
like a laborer he was making like 300

00:58:33.839 --> 00:58:36.240
a week in his house by himself yeah all

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:39.040

just like a pack of hot dogs

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.920
yeah but that's that's a single dad yeah

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.480
that's if phil was left unchecked

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.079
that would be a bridge of hot dogs could

00:58:52.079 --> 00:58:54.000
be slightly nicer hot dogs yeah he'd be

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.760
sucking down hot dogs

00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.680
he sucks them down regardless there's

00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.599

that he had already cooked

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.280
that's a veteran move taking him out of

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.640
the weird packaging and put him in a

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:12.240
ziploc ziploc bag that eventually gets

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.359
like wet inside

00:59:13.359 --> 00:59:17.200

and putting them in the fridge again

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:20.720
