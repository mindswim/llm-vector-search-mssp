00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.270
little to worry about or do like maybe I

should take a week in South Carolina and

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.349

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:27.860
[ __ ] dogs there's two idiots [ __ ] you

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.330
morons oh these are cute I was outside

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.880
and whenever they would see another dog

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.979
they would be like Oh Matilda would

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:39.690
start growling when dogs would see them

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.129
they will grab them

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:42.659
were like making weird noises and

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:44.639
running around I swear to god they feel

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.089
like something weirds going on like I

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:50.849
think it was that the oh if your owners

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:52.649
on edge your dogs kind of extra edge

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:54.119
yeah I think the owners are walking

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:54.809
around on edge

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:56.399
so when dogs see each other like what

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:57.479
the [ __ ] are you doing do you get out of

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.129
here and then he literally saw that a

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:01.169
couple times and then I had we came back

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:02.699
I thought it was like a baby crying

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:05.369
there are two cats like wailing and

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:07.050
doing weird [ __ ] and running like two

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.339
cats running away from each other I

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:11.789

00:11:56.029 --> 00:11:58.310

00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:35.649

what only cool guys drink that's

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.910
actually I think that might be both of

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.589
our poison dude remember down the beach

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:12.069

00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:14.810
Captain Morgan is my absolute kryptonite

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.100
dude that's what I have a bottle of

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:16.810

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.780
I got Roman coke dude just sitting in

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.230
there I do die you know you throw up a

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.630
liquor and you can't drink it anymore

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.950
that just isn't the case of Captain

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.840
Morgan I could like literally I could

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.580
like [ __ ] that out of my mouth and I

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.470
would just be like stuff although I did

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.300
there was uh there was a cup on the

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.770
counter and I took a sip of it this

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.510
morning and it had Coke in it and I was

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.020
just like oh really just instantly I was

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.280
like oh yeah this is what I drank

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.050
yesterday oh you're doing rum and cokes

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.400
yeah how much coke did you drink

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.330
probably like a leader

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.450
Oh almost half of one of those big

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.910
bottles that's good it wasn't bad it

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.860
wasn't like a crazy amount I mean that

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.930
is a lot of coke the drinks it's a

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.670
decent amount of coke yeah then I woke

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.960
up today I was like damn dude my

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.550
stomach's [ __ ] up I think I have

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:08.980
karate or that bottle of rum drink last

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.750
night

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.030
[ __ ] that's so funny never drink a whole

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.600
bottle of rum to your face like that

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.160
I've never finished one probably I've

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.650
had to finish it I've gotten close to

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.870
nice always drink I'm like down to like

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.490
that much and bigger I'm not a

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:25.990
degenerate I'm not gonna finish this I

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.660
was like I need to finish this that's

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.730
strong I think this is the move is to

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.660
drink this whole bottle

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.030
that's good alcohol logic of just like

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.470
we gotta finit we have to finish all

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.810
this I got pushed through yeah that's

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.640
funny at a party like we kind of finish

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.830
this cake it's like guys I gotta [ __ ]

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:47.290
get this kid kicked bro a little less

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.120
traffic tonight Matt opposed what

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.890
there's gonna be nobody on the road when

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.160
you drive slowing down there's dude I'm

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.630
in Philadelphia there's nobody outside

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.700
it was just me I saw a bliss from like a

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.790
block away it was like what's up bro it

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.950
was crazy it's nuts did he just lay the

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.240
baby clothes on the ground and then you

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.890
picked them up now we said what's up we

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.240
chilled I'm not I'm not scared of the

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.220
[ __ ] bro I don't know if it's

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.500
[ __ ] Matthew I don't think it's

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.090
[ __ ] but you know I don't really

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.790
participate in illness so it's not what

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:24.700
I do what do you think of that somebody

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.130
a wait wait long ago it's awesome I

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.690
think that might be West Watson like I

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:29.630
don't participate

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.389
so I I'm trying my best to not

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:35.480
participate in this but here's the plan

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.790
if we if we get that house in South

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.649
cattle a key yeah I'm gonna have a

00:15:39.649 --> 00:15:42.139
Connie come down and be easier come down

00:15:42.139 --> 00:15:47.300
mm-hmm I think that might be a risk what

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.209
do you mean like a noise damn I think

00:15:50.209 --> 00:15:51.709
you're Kovich strong right now I think

00:15:51.709 --> 00:15:56.029
you're good you know annoying it's gonna

00:15:56.029 --> 00:15:59.600
be once the [ __ ] leaves yeah we did it

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.880
yeah true

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.230
like what New Jersey got that hurricane

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.790
it's gonna be that just out of national

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.399
level it's gonna be so [ __ ] annoying

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:08.839
yeah that'll be [ __ ] annoying it's

00:16:08.839 --> 00:16:12.800
it's yeah that'll be crazy on all it'll

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.420
just be dead man's and perhaps and most

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.680
of them deserve it dude they're still

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.829
out I'm nice I'm a theory Cove it'd only

00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:22.370
accept only it affects liberals I think

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.110
Kovac can only get in your skin if your

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.560
lib really if you want the wall you you

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.389
can't get Kovac that's why Africa's

00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:31.850
untouched there's a continent of black

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.759
conservatives I'm gonna throw in a dip

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:37.420
go ahead go ahead

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.519
oh wait let me put down the snowball bro

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:42.019
put down the snowball for me and just

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:44.540
listen at it look at the [ __ ] tripod

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.480
it comes with oh that's the snowball

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.100
there's like what's the thing that ninja

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.019
like the shredder rolls around in it

00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:54.620
looks like the Technodrome oh you can't

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.930
talk you don't got the snow that's pop

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.759
it in dude pop that [ __ ] in damn dude

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.139
this is [ __ ] sick we're just doing

00:17:03.139 --> 00:17:09.079
vapes and skulls right now but yeah I

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:15.289
think this is gonna be what I do now so

00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:16.789
I'm gonna point that out I just talked

00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:23.000
into a beer bottle that's doing I think

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.589
this is going to be overall good for us

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.750
so I think is zap to our like

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.179
consciousness in terms of like coming to

00:17:29.179 --> 00:17:31.580
grips with our mortality I think that's

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.380
a medicine that we've been in dire need

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.720
for of a long time I think that's true I

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.970
think this is gonna shake the [ __ ]

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:38.540
out dude

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.870
yeah I mean it's it'll definitely

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.430

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.679
we're you know we're in the midst of a

00:23:56.679 --> 00:23:58.990
national crisis I think it's forgivable

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.280

[ __ ] you know put smiles on the

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:07.179
people's faces but dude I uh I what did

00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:07.540
I do

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.820
oh I actually wrote so I figured out

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.429
that soap opera idea I want to do it's

00:24:12.429 --> 00:24:14.110
pretty good it's pretty good out the

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.740
boner

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.480
no wait the sibian one or the boner

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.520
pills it's a kind of combination of a

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.410
bunch of stuff dude I can I can I can

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.700
literally pitch it to you right now I

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.900
think it's pretty good dude

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.310
the idea is

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:28.030
dude so is funny I merged it I merged it

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.250
with a couple of I like it you want to

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:31.480
hear it or you want me to save it you

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.810
only save that for off the [ __ ] page

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.130
or you may drop it to you no job but

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.530
right now I have to yeah so but it is

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.110
combining so it's all shot like a soap

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.580
opera so where it's like super

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.700
highlighting zoom ins on the face so the

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.960
whole and this is just one of the

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.660
narratives I would be a retired like

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.180

you could do that too that's that's the

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.670
beauty of that you could do what a man

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.200
needs to be riding a sybian at some

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.750
point for sure I mean that would that

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.950
should be the I was also thinking

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:43.060
another thing we're like

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.120
might like since I'm a sex educator my

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.860
son would walk in on me riding a sybian

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.060
and I would try to give him the birds

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.370
and bees talk right after looks on guys

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:54.610
and groups like wait what no no no while

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.960
no don't don't don't run for this come

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.240
here that way while you're talking you

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.630
can be like even better to if like if I

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:06.310
was having like a high-powered meeting

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.080
or I was like talking to my wife s on

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.820
the Sirius and flicked on the CB and sat

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:20.560
on it in a suit very gratuitous come

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.480
scene oh not a sybian just straight up

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.160
like it a real nut scene - I would

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:48.220
actual actual not like a bad dog if you

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.110
get on YouTube I'm curious can you show

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.260
bodily fluids like if you didn't have a

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.970
penis and frame would you show like a

00:29:54.970 --> 00:30:01.120
rope flying cuz you could you have to be

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.980
able to show like saliva on YouTube so

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.570
it would actually be that'd be our

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.340
production company could be called

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.620
tribute and we could at the you know at

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.350
the end when they show those you know I

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.210
mean after the credits they're just

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.400
quick tributing on to like the logo

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.220
could be tribute tribute media and then

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.350
we both kids on actual jizz on there

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.900
yeah they'll be like we never tell

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.840
anybody its jizz true just have it like

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.490
on like a zoomed in on a microscope of

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.140
like 300 accidents it'll probably looks

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.870
cool as [ __ ] if you microscope jizz

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.010
actually it would actually might see

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:37.780
sperm cells swimming true I wonder what

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:41.350
X do you need to see sperm cells I don't

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.390
know like are they visible with like a

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:54.820
jeweler's loupe well that's great that's

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.190
dude so I wrote that last night on my

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.440
note on my phone no to my phone I left I

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.210
left a lot of wiggle room a lot of it's

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.590
just like an N chain says something

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:07.330
funny and then I do this dude I mean

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.600
this serious yeah it'd be incredible

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.980
sneak coming down on an alright comedy

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.020
podcaster alone in a basement it'd be so

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.600
fun just to [ __ ] you be so funny okay

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.790
get the women out of here you're like I

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:23.200
don't women get the same as men they

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.340
need to shut the [ __ ] up about all that

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:32.560
I guess I could probably improv a couple

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.680
lines on that come up with some thoughts

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:42.070
Oh obviously [ __ ] art all art yeah

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.540
man that's a great idea hopefully

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.130
hopefully I survived comon

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.870
that we can do it you're gonna crush

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.940
co-head dude I'm getting it

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.860
you probably literally killed Cove eight

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.150
last night when you drank a bottle of

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:59.170
rum a liter of soda they just all died

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:03.700
everything you just died and reset I got

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.070
the wrong one

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.450
the virus is like this is not where I

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.220
want to be right now I'm out of the

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.500
virus can't handle Margaritaville dude

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.420
honestly - I think this virus - like

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.090
lodges in your throat so if you were to

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.830
be drinking alcohol I burnt that [ __ ]

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:21.640
alive I don't think that that works I

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.590
really don't want any sir Charles could

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:26.110
have been smart dude sir Charles gave me

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.300
Cova dude I'll be [ __ ] ticked I'm

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.500
telling you I think you cured yourself I

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.610
think you might have came across the

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:34.780
vaccine an entire bottle of rum that's

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.730
why Mexico's fine right now good yeah

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.530
the lads are good well the thing is it's

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:42.670
just no one's testing it's the same

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.500
thing with like when people like Africa

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.640
is actually pretty good it's like well

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.080
no they just don't have [ __ ] tests

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.820
also you know you have to get a bunch of

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.440
shouts before you go down to lay certain

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.259
countries yeah hope it might have rolled

00:32:53.259 --> 00:32:56.289
through and they're like by it might be

00:32:56.289 --> 00:33:01.360
immune to it okay Joe there's some

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.190

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.779
thing is I'm listening to [ __ ] CNN

00:33:13.779 --> 00:33:15.940

to 60% of Americans already have it keep

00:33:23.529 --> 00:33:25.899
hearing that I keep hearing that dude I

00:33:25.899 --> 00:33:27.159

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:31.750

00:33:48.009 --> 00:33:50.049
mean that's right now it's either not a

00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:53.350
big deal or it was a bio weapon that we

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:55.509
were being exposed to or it's just a

00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:57.970
weird thing that might not have come

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:01.200
from people eating bats

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:12.010
it's a funny way to go dude anyway for

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.079
the world then dude it's pretty I mean

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:16.480
also people people just start eating

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.980
bats so what the [ __ ] happened

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.990
I don't know well the thing about that

00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:25.210
those markets is they're so [ __ ]

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.639
packed with other animals true like

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:29.319
mixing with it's like fighting each

00:34:29.319 --> 00:34:32.679
other [ __ ] oh yeah they might have made

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:34.079
a wild like fruit punch

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:36.550
they did what happens when I mix a bat

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:46.060
with an armadillo it is funny that you

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.190
can't associate China with it at all

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.050
it's like that's [ __ ] up to even

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.060
mention the fact that it came from there

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.360
yes that y-yeah what the [ __ ] why is

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.040
that familiar that started a virus I

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.630
wouldn't be butthurt being like hey come

00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:59.400
on guys

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.660
viruses a viruses don't know what

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.830
countries are what are you talking about

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:05.710
yeah sorry guys argument pirates don't

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.600
have borders it's like well they do have

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:14.560
like don't eat bats they do have origin

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.080
stories they might not have borders true

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.540
guess who's munching bats no what's

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.830
weird though is that like so how many

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:22.390
other viruses are just lurking around

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:24.520
waiting to be like pulled out of

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.590
whatever weird portal we pull viruses

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:29.820
out of like there is like aids on it yes

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.280
well it's it's uh what's the word it's

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.820
like zoo something with the word zoo in

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:45.370
it zoology it's it's all it's sad it's

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:45.880
Latin

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.240
yes okay it's like animals have these

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.190
viruses and when they mutate and

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:54.400
transfer to humans we can that's what we

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.650
get [ __ ] up that sucks

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.020
yeah so if they mutate and they did

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.610
because people were [ __ ] tossing bats

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:04.360
around yeah awesome I'm back dude that's

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:09.670
like the spider-man bite dude that is

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.020
weird to think about how many are just

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:12.550
lurking around you there could be like

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.890
some other weird virus being contained

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.260
on some other thing yeah munch one of

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.570
those dogs you might get something

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:21.130
farted that's [ __ ] up

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.510
have you thought about which dog you'll

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:26.170
eat first if you have to Jackson's

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:28.120
disgust Jackson literally smells like

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.820
puke right now Tildy would be like

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.150
eating some like lamb she'd be good I

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.650
think Jackson you get him on nice spit

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:42.700
roast I might I might just makes I might

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.500
just make like dog bone stock out you

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.820
know you could make like soup out of

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.140
their bones that you had to you could

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.520
that's it was a Batman or it was a

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.890
spider-man bite Oh for the [ __ ] Zeb

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:55.390
didn't morph to all of us into Chinese

00:36:55.390 --> 00:37:01.930
people we all breaks my heart to see

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.160
people wearing them here I'm like come

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.200
on man

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.860
I know I know what about [ __ ] II just

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.530
saw it was like what did you experience

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:11.820
the world if we're having like a

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.190
particulate respirator yeah if someone

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:15.660
doesn't breathe the wrong [ __ ] on you

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.850
it's like that [ __ ] sucks kappa oh

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.600
yeah but count me out of that dude yeah

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.560
dude so uh that's [ __ ]

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.680
I mean dude I'm telling you right now

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.130
this is pretty unprecedented bubonic

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:32.820
plague

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.220
it was pretty wicked but like this is

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.840
pretty straight this is a strange

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.260
combination of first of all this is the

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.490
this is the first thing that could take

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:43.170
Trump out of the national spotlight is a

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.680
pandemic that was the only thing dude we

grandpa dying yeah and like the first

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.910
tweet underneath it was like at Donald

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.320
Trump this is your fault

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.050
it's like Jesus Christ [ __ ] man cuz the

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.650
78 year old went on a [ __ ] cruise

40 years of your life being like alright

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.740
I think I just you know the war kind of

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.200
[ __ ] me up and then you can tract

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.790
[ __ ] Cove it you're like mother

00:38:53.790 --> 00:39:01.110
[ __ ] mother [ __ ] yeah I had a joke

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.940
about that about my one cousin that uses

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.010
the n-word and I'm like I hope you get

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:07.730
AI hope of like to does shoot him

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.050
so while he's dying to give me like I

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:12.530
told you

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.920
stop why'd you stop doing this hilarious

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.559
because the setup to the joke was like

00:39:22.559 --> 00:39:24.420
my one cousin says it a lot

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:27.480
Oh five is top five like if you added up

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.010
all his words it would be like top five

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:40.589
oh behind I'm sick of these did you know

00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:42.210
it didn't survive the Trump

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:44.280
administration that's a tough climb that

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.490
that cleansed a lot of jokes

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:50.010
that's a tough set up dude yes please

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:51.420
yeah those those from the Harrisburg

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.740
open mic days I've since maternity vault

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.650
be a bacillus that's pretty funny also

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:00.089
funny to say that's that's one of his

00:40:00.089 --> 00:40:01.890
top five words if you really have you

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:04.859
added up all the words out if you do a

00:40:04.859 --> 00:40:06.089
word cloud that would be like the

00:40:06.089 --> 00:40:12.569
biggest one oh yeah it's uh it is

00:40:12.569 --> 00:40:16.890
[ __ ] scary and I do feel I feel kind

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:22.140
of bad that I'm out and traveling but it

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.630
seems I don't know it seems kind of dumb

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:27.180
and [ __ ] risky but I don't like yeah

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.559
what do you indefinitely don't feel like

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:30.660
going to [ __ ] New York City dude I I

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.190
think that's the smartest thing not to

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.200
go there I mean I guess you could like

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.299
hang out in other people's apartments

00:40:36.299 --> 00:40:38.640
and have like like one-on-one fun time

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.660
but I don't think a lot of people are

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.049
gonna do that no my base trying to fully

00:40:43.049 --> 00:40:44.940
quarantine or it's trying to warn Jen

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.760
from going out like anywhere we had to

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.799
be able to light a bad I did yeah but

00:40:49.799 --> 00:40:51.119
like if I'm gonna if I could like go to

00:40:51.119 --> 00:40:52.859
a podcast or something if I'm hanging

00:40:52.859 --> 00:40:54.000

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.190
whole new experience for me so that's

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:05.730
into automatic negative thinking yeah as

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.109
a matter there's a big lever dude in the

00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:09.480

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:13.859
industrial revolution just trying to get

00:53:13.859 --> 00:53:15.630
it back to its automatically perceiving

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:17.580
events positively instead of negatively

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:23.070
I automatically do dude what the [ __ ]

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:24.780
are you doing down here I started going

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.280
into an eggo prison dude and I was like

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.080
what the [ __ ] going on then I thought

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.099
about it I was like why am i

00:53:29.099 --> 00:53:30.480
automatically perceiving things

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.369
negatively and I just switched it up on

00:53:32.369 --> 00:53:34.619

is a [ __ ] power and it's like the

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.619
smartest thing you can do right now it's

00:53:43.619 --> 00:53:45.030
the sickest thing you can do right now

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:46.339

after a week I gotta go [ __ ] find

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:17.670
another place yeah but then you could

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:18.690
you could do something you can go to

00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:20.369

there for like 20 bucks

00:54:36.619 --> 00:54:40.890
shouting hotels down - Wow yeah I think

00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:42.960
