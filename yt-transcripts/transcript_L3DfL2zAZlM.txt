she kept talking about her ptsd and i

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.360
had to walk away from her because she

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.520
was triggering my ptsd

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.800
of listening to people with ptsd

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.080
storytellers i don't know what to tell

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.000
you

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.160
um but uh good to be here in texas very

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.840
hot you know i like how there's two

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.600
temperatures there's like feels like

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.960
temperature and whatever the other

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.479
temperature is which

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:49.919
i don't get the point of that because

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.160
the only way i interact with temperature

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.039
is by feeling it

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.639
the is this other number doing

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.039
feels like 72 but sounds like 45 and

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:05.280
smells like 12.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.360

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.960

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.319
um

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.560
i think that uh if guns are legal then

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.160
traps should be legal you should be able

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.840
to trap a you know

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:19.759
if you bend down to pick up a supreme

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:22.639

in front of a live audience sold out to

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:23.599
the gills every single week i must say

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:25.440
i would say that that is one of the sets

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.520
in which you've got the least amount of

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.479
laughter and my question is

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:32.399
why do you think that is this week and

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.080
not any other week what do you think

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.479
happened in your life this week that has

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:39.120
you a little bit softer than usual here

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.320
is it because you're starting to dress

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.560
cool

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:46.320

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.680
a couple tours you're starting to buy

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.760
 whatever that shirt is a

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.080
little fun fact shane i was here last

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.640

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.320
forth about where did you park did she

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.680

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.760
forgetful and she's like sorry i was

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.440

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.880

don't think that uh she likes me anymore

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.880

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:24.880
might not know exactly how this works

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.839
but on this show any drummer has a

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.760
chance to become the new full-time

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.400

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.559

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.679
the show rules mexican drama off goes

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:58.640
like this it is uh they get each a drum

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.400

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.799
new endeavor

01:07:50.799 --> 01:07:53.200

at it again

01:26:57.679 --> 01:27:00.719
