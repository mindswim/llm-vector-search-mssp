[ __ ] people

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.920

walmart when i was a checkout thief

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:22.160
i would do it so brazenly because i

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.920
would look at them and be like this guy

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.279

they're not even looking

00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:35.600

skankfest covet i have

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.920
i i think i had it two weeks ago after

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.680
my wedding but my bo you know i've i've

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.040
recovered from it i think i actually

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.560
probably did because really well at

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.000
rookies i got that antibody test and

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.160
they said you've come in contact with it

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.200
recently

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.480
my body said no yeah dude it's

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.000
hot i'm telling you hot bath and eat

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.600
spicy food and it goes away and it's

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.720
that's my that's what i do for me

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.000
personally i'm obviously not a doctor

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.760
i'm not giving out medical advice

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.880
every time that i think that i have

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.160
covet and i didn't get a test cause i

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.560
didn't feel like it i would go take a

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.839
hot bath

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:41.680
and dude it kills it every time that

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.600
would probably have some benefit right

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.279
dude i think it sounds like that makes

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:47.200
sense sick i just scorched my i give

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.399
myself a fever

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:50.480
yeah kills it i like grasping for

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.040
everything other than the vax

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.360
it's very funny to be like i think this

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.800
might work

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.639

off like they just cut like the vein on

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:30.480
the side of your head i think it worked

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.800
you put a bowl here

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.920

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.800
like get rid of some of your blood

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.800
bloodletting

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:48.880

have bad people are gonna have bad times

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.360
that must have been a dark move when you

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.959
accidentally bloodlet a little too hard

00:12:58.959 --> 00:13:01.200

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.160
because he uh he would breathe in he was

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.000
a firm believer of getting fresh air

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.079
every single day so he'd open his window

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:29.519
no matter what time of year it was and

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:31.040
sit and just breathe in like air and

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.560
especially in the winter time and he

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.399
developed an abscess in his lung

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:35.839
just from sitting in front of the cold

00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:37.279
air

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.720
like you can only talk about this

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.440
person's bush that'd be fun that'd be

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.240
fun that is a fun thing

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.159
did gladiator pump you up it did

00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:09.919
actually yeah gladiator pump me it was

00:21:09.919 --> 00:21:11.520
actually that opening scene was firing

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.120
me up yeah that pumped me up it was

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.960
tough to turn off gladiator to do this

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.440
podcast it's i genuinely yeah i thought

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.679
about just sending out a brief memo that

00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:21.760
guy sorry we drove up to new york ended

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.960
up watching fatty gladiators

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.720
it's hard to turn that off it is

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.559
especially seeing the the

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:30.320
the part we're in in the movie is

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.000
probably the sickest yeah dude he's down

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.600
in africa

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.159
balling out yeah because spain

00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:37.840
yeah i think he was down in morocco i

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.840
would imagine yeah

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.480
yeah dude that's uh far from the horn oh

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.400
the horns over by the middle east

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.000
east coast yeah

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.080
west coast gotcha yes

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.720
dude i've been reading about the uh

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.080
i'm almost done that joseph campbell

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.640
book they talk about the bear cults

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.919
back in the day

00:21:55.919 --> 00:21:58.080
so the japanese ones not just japanese

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.600
but they did it was in a bunch of

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.799
different areas yeah i remember you told

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:03.760
me that about those not that not the anu

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.880
those are just water

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.559
this was in i think

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:08.559
in ger in africa they did more kind of

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:09.679
like the

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:11.520
feline cold type of thing but the same

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.960
same idea but like in the germanic

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.000
region

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.919
you would have in like up around there

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:17.200
these dudes were just like freezing it

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.039
was [ __ ] cold as hell it's ice age i

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:20.960
think it was the uh um i'm trying to get

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.720
cool name which ice age it was i forget

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.799
instantly that's a massive

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.240
worm

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.200
yeah

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.880
something like that

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.360
uh the worm weiss no the uh

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.960
so these guys would just be [ __ ]

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.960
freezing their dicks off and bears

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.280
hibernated so they'd like get to a cave

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.720
and be like

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.000
[ __ ] [ __ ] this diet and then they

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.200
just look in the back of the cave

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.720
there'd be like a bear family just

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.200
snoozing down oh no and they'd be like

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.280
sweet so they would just char they would

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.720
just carve up a bear family they had

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.799
like a walk-in freezer but that's why

00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:52.080
they honored the bear the bear was like

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.000
a gift from the gods so what they did

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.679
was in all these different areas they'd

00:22:55.679 --> 00:22:58.080
find they would excavate and find these

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.720
bear skulls with like the eyes like

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.000
covered up because they didn't want the

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.240
bear to like i guess see them yeah they

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.600
did the same thing in africa when they

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.280
when you killed a panther you had to

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.640
like took the skull and you put like

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.840
bones in its eyes so you didn't get the

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.679
evil eye so you killed a panther you had

00:23:11.679 --> 00:23:13.600
to close your eyes and then sneak up on

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.280
it to take it down

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.480
probably was ineffective

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.080
but it's pretty tight they had they had

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.840
caves all around the world of that one

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.240
thing of a bear yeah they would headless

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.600
bear and they put the skull down they'd

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.039
cover up its eyes

00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:28.080
it makes

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.520
this is one thing i could you ever see

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.360
that show alone no when they're up in

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.400
alaska if they're opening it in a

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.360
freight type thing yeah it's kind of

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.799
like that they just drop people off in

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:37.200
different parts of alaska yeah or canada

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.960
and let them [ __ ]

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.320
try to survive and whoever survives the

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.400
longest wins what what is this in the

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.240
wilderness is this under like the uh

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.720
tyranny of just canadian gay [ __ ]

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.240

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.200
so they're out the remote like but they

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.039
all end up like after like a month if

they kill an animal they like worship it

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:04.799

all those videos of like this is how

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.559
you're really doing it's lincoln park

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:04.320

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.080
you do pick them up

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.440
there's a lot of those videos going

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.080
around like [ __ ] tmz shame on them

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.679
dude they're such funny they're putting

00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:15.520
[ __ ] out of like here's time someone

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.840
actually got it right they are constant

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.440
although did you hear that the security

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.679
detail at astroworld

00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:24.080
apparently allegedly according to i'm

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.679
fairly certain those are greeters the

00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:28.080
smurfs they aren't the best hires dude

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.159
security detail at astroworld so here's

00:26:30.159 --> 00:26:32.799
the thing though there was apparently

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:34.320
uh they agree some they had like an

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.720
internal memo or some type of code that

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.720
was like yo if somebody dies

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.320
over the radio you call them a smurf you

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.559
don't say death and you don't say dead

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:43.600
because that way they don't want to get

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.120
it picked up and have like cop make it a

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.640
scene yeah that way you can kind of

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.960
quietly squid games like

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.640
[ __ ] yeah eliminate dead guy out of

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.000
there because yeah i figured somebody is

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.440
going to overnight overdose exactly so

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.960
like someone might die here so look

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.799
here's the deal yeah dude festivals are

00:26:56.799 --> 00:27:00.320
the bag dude that's the major bag

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.600
so they're going like the radio just

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.240
like smurf holy [ __ ] a bunch of smurfs

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.520
and then there was another thing saying

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.000
and if there's a bomb threat

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.679
let's see if it's real don't get

00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:11.279
everyone all freaked out that's kind of

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:12.960
what could be which exactly that could

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.640
be a for like you know don't make people

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.159
freaking out don't make a stampede

00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:18.000
bother it yeah exactly but they were

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
like let's show us the let's see the

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.440
bomb don't you know

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.440

we're in new york we can go to the five

00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:45.440
dude we can go stand in the window you

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.200
don't think they're sold out

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.880
i don't think they have a live audience

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.800
oh that makes sense because remember we

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.920
were watching them and it was just

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.520
silent after everything you were saying

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.119
true it was very quiet it's only because

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:57.920
there was no crowd otherwise you'd be oh

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.200
yeah it's a tough that's a gauntlet to

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.000
get into

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.680
the five in new york city yeah where are

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.920
you going i think i can get on gutfelt

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.920
you could dude 100 there's comedians

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.520
down there all the time yeah dude you

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.160
got on the whole time we're just going

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.960
and it's [ __ ] joe mackey works for

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.960
him i don't know we saw that yeah i was

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.720

popped up we were watching clips of it

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.079
on the way home from last time we did it

00:36:20.079 --> 00:36:20.960
here

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.160
and there's there's like it breaks

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.800
it breaks down it starts to like lose

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.040
the thread of any kind of sense it's so

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.720
[ __ ] the five might be the worst show

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.599
i've ever seen in my [ __ ] life dude

00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:34.800
but we were watching the file we were

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.920

it's just him killing his staff yeah

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.839
that's the whole bit the whole gang has

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:04.560
fun true also according to them they are

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.480
the number one late night talk show and

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.560
according to the internet is it true is

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.640
it true yeah it was wikipedia that was

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.160
everyone uh tore that page out of

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.000
trump's book to attack ratings yeah just

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.240
people said it was like [ __ ] ratings

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.160
it's like you had no idea yeah but

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.320
msnbc's ratings were

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.320
but everyone now but but it all it is if

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.760
they are number one dude that's a rock

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.359
star lifestyle they're living just

00:37:25.359 --> 00:37:26.800

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.720
do the puppet sketch we'll go get [ __ ]

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.079
up well they probably are because they

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:31.599
have no competition because they have

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:33.119
they have to compete with like

00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:34.240
kimmel

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.440

to be they're they're competition so

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.520
they might be the number one

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.280
conservative late night talk show i

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.040

them on wikipedia and then it's true

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.400

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.800
speaking of people's families abandoning

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.319
them that was what the open letter was

00:48:18.319 --> 00:48:20.630
about to anthony fauci um

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:23.119
[Laughter]

00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:25.200
he uh i was reading a letter and so the

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:28.079
video i i got sidetracked

00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:30.160
was him going on and being basically

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.599
saying like well

00:48:31.599 --> 00:48:33.200
it's highly probable that people can

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.280
catch hiv aids off of people who are

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.440
positive for it just by like living in a

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.480
house with them you don't have to have

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.599
sex with him you don't have to shoot

00:48:39.599 --> 00:48:41.839
drugs he's like you know just like

00:48:41.839 --> 00:48:44.319
sharing a spoon or whatever he's like

00:48:44.319 --> 00:48:45.680
it's very pop we think it's very

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.160
possible and then the the what people

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.760
are mad about this is the stuff you

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.440
can't talk about really and you know

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:52.480
again i don't know if it's real or not

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.800
but yeah they were saying that

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.960
they that administration under him was

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.480
pushing for a vaccine for aids

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.760
and they put tons of research and

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.680
blocked other treatments in the meantime

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.359
and then like dude so many people died

00:49:05.359 --> 00:49:06.160
and then they're like oh let's check

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.280

been watching there's a show it's

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.400
the same people that did assassination

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.480
of versace

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.160
they're doing one now on the impeachment

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.800
of bill clinton and it [ __ ] rules but

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.480
there's one the episode i just watched

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.680
is about how

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.880
how clinton got out of it technically

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.240
i don't know i i didn't know this was a

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.400
i was a young boy when this happened but

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.359
it was like uh he in his previous rape

00:50:57.359 --> 00:50:58.400
case

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.680
they had given him documents on

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:02.559
um

00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:04.079
what sexual

00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:06.240
relations meant

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.319
they gave him a document and he read it

00:51:08.319 --> 00:51:10.400
and it was like this is what sexual

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.760
relations are

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.440
so then when monica lewinsky came around

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.119
he was like i didn't have sexual

00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:17.040
relations and they were like didn't you

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.160
say

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.839
she performed oral sex on you and he's

00:51:19.839 --> 00:51:22.640
like by your definition on my previous

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.839
rape case

00:51:23.839 --> 00:51:26.640
that wasn't sexual contact or relations

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.800
what like that's how he got out of it

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.319
what yeah

00:51:30.319 --> 00:51:32.559
yeah it was beast the doc the show makes

00:51:32.559 --> 00:51:34.800
you kind of like bill clinton a lot he's

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.040
a scumbag but he's also like

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.319

smooth willie

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.280
he was slick dude but there's one part

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.359
where they're like you can't you can't

00:51:47.359 --> 00:51:49.119
tell the truth here because then you'll

00:51:49.119 --> 00:51:51.440

00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.599

although that whole [ __ ] village true

00:53:02.079 --> 00:53:04.240
i i am curious as to what actually

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:06.400
happened yeah of course i mean it's a

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.760
show on fx is it hillary can you take

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.839
your dark cloak off of your head that's

00:53:09.839 --> 00:53:12.880
true the goat's head she's sleeping in

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.839
oh

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.960
[Laughter]

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.480
well it's also funny too i mean it could

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.240
be who knows though who knows but it is

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.400
funny for him to be like

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.440
that rape case and being like well

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.760
yeah my fancy lemons true he's already

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.599
got some [ __ ] decent info out of that

00:53:39.599 --> 00:53:41.280
yeah how did so how did he what was what

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.280
did they say sexual relations wise he

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.040
was like touching with the intent to

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.280
stimulate on the girl it's not sexual it

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.720
was all just [ __ ] where he

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.800
technically he was like i didn't lie

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.280
which that's the crime if he lied during

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.280
his his testimony gotcha then he

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.280
committed perjury then he was gotcha

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.440
then he was guilty and could be

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.920
fired that makes sense but because

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.640
legally he told the truth right

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.839
it didn't matter that he got his dick

00:54:05.839 --> 00:54:07.200
sucked

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.319
that's not what they were trying to get

00:54:08.319 --> 00:54:09.839
him on they were trying to get him on

00:54:09.839 --> 00:54:11.520
getting his dick sucked that makes sense

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.880
yeah so they kind of like played with

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.400
the definition of like the thing he was

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.680
actually up to yeah i mean there's one

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.440
sounds like he's like

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.960
my enemy dude i'm fighting right now on

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.640

think this vaccine thing is a big is a

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.960
big mistake these libs often make which

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.119
is to try to attack the best quarterback

00:56:17.119 --> 00:56:19.680
in the nfl yeah they tried it with brady

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.359

00:56:23.839 --> 00:56:25.760
big ben they had it

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.839
pretty solid what did big bang do he did

not engage in sexual relations he i

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.920
don't think he intended to stimulate the

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.240
woman once you have multiple like

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.640
