guys well I I went skiing out at

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.640
Whistler and we met there was a comedy

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.600
show there that I did and it was amazing

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.040
so much [ __ ] Coke there dude all

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.600
those people it's like half Australians

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.680
all they do is blow all they do is blow

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.560
out every [ __ ] day that's true

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.800
Australians love cocaine yeah

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.839
Australians they always get that and

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:03.120
then when they finally get anywhere else

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.839
like it's so [ __ ] cheap here they

00:09:04.839 --> 00:09:06.680
can't stop doing it they might pay the

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.680
most for drugs they might I think in

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.720
Australia everything's like it's

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.839
probably like prison it's like five

00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:11.920
times what it should call that's my

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.360
opener in Australia I'm like you know

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.839
it's general rule of thumb is the more

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:17.040
expensive thing is the better quality is

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.519
and with that in mind the cocaine in

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:23.079
Australia must be by far the best in the

00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:25.720
world cut yeah I was in I was in Brazil

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.120
and there was Australians there and like

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.440
one of the dudes I was with he was like

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.240
luckily he was like South American so he

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.399
went into the favella to buy coke these

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:35.680
Australian dudes were like so [ __ ]

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.360

coming back dude on Palm Sunday they

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.760

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.040
Australians were coked out in this

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.959

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.720
like Australians I know I believe that

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.839

I've heard I've heard the sandwiches are

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.119
great they are they're good why would

00:39:36.119 --> 00:39:37.960
you stop doing them at a certain hour

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.599
though it's a popup it's not a like like

00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:43.920
like it's not a restaurant it's a popup

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.560
inside of a restaurant what's a popup

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.000
just make popup means like you're doing

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.599
like a like a highlighted thing inside

00:39:48.599 --> 00:39:51.000
of a functioning restaurant like you

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.599
can't do it all you have to do it during

00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:54.400
certain hours so they're able to

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.200
maintain an accommodate but isn't a

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.920
popup sort of a novel moment where

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.440
exactly where but if you're doing it

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.640
consistently would you call it a popup

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.040

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.920

the marijuana yeah it's stri stripping

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.960
for people with English there was I was

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.599
reading there was there was a piece that

00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:33.079
came out about a lot of the women who

00:47:33.079 --> 00:47:36.079
went to only fans who were then getting

00:47:36.079 --> 00:47:38.880
like outed and then losing their jobs at

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.680
like only yeah the at losing their jobs

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.839
at like the non jobs or say yeah and

00:47:43.839 --> 00:47:45.079
then they were like I don't know what to

00:47:45.079 --> 00:47:48.640
do now I'm only making you know $116,000

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.240
a month on only fans and you're like

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.720
well that clearly that was better than

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:53.960
your work you should have you should

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.800
have committed to it fully anyway dive

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.680
in they don't have benefits though no no

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.280
they're just punishing

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.559
themselves constantly every pretty much

00:48:02.559 --> 00:48:04.599
everyone on only fans every porn star

00:48:04.599 --> 00:48:07.559
every stripper is is also a [ __ ]

00:48:07.559 --> 00:48:10.480
prostitute yeah no that's not true

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.359
pretty much everyone that's not true

00:48:12.359 --> 00:48:13.839
what are you doing later every stripper

00:48:13.839 --> 00:48:15.079
is like what are you doing like we can

00:48:15.079 --> 00:48:17.040
talk that's not true that's true you

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.880
don't have it's like I think in like

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.880
some you can make sweeping

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.520
generalizations like that about but not

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.559
about that it's most no like like for I

00:48:25.559 --> 00:48:27.480
think it's true if you say like all Jews

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:31.200
are evil but that's

00:48:32.359 --> 00:48:34.680
different do you know what I mean but

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.839
like I don't think you could say that

00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:39.040
about strippers and

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.480
hookers you actually did do it you got

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.880
your be on that one I didn't know where

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.240

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.319
time he loves

00:48:48.319 --> 00:48:51.319
it but yeah no they all have their price

00:48:51.319 --> 00:48:53.000
yeah it's like the United you could

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.520
bribe the United States government but

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.920
you just need like a billion dollars so

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.680

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.920
Cops you just need you need one moment

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:11.119
where you're the guy on camera like

01:00:11.119 --> 01:00:13.799
bending down and and breaking it up or

01:00:13.799 --> 01:00:16.480

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.640
what you what what situation are you

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.559

01:00:19.559 --> 01:00:21.480

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.680
someone a a homeless person pushes you

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.599
want to beat that hell nice

01:00:26.599 --> 01:00:29.039

01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:35.880
jump down and I sort of cover her and

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:38.799
push her into the trough and we and we

01:00:38.799 --> 01:00:41.680
and the train comes over us and then we

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.640
scramble out and I'm like we're all good

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.000
here and by that point everyone's

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.480
filming yeah and then when you punch

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.760
that homeless guy that's when the thing

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.079

the bull for giving you the horns when

you shouldn't have been in the ring in

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.679
the first

01:17:14.679 --> 01:17:17.120
place that's a good metaphor so I think

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.840
in that is the pubes or the horns he's

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.120
the hole you guys got in the ring we got

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.840

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.560

rousing for us did you shave up no I go

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.199
with the grain but at some point when

01:17:37.199 --> 01:17:38.520
you get to the base you got to you got

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.600
to come from the other side you shave

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.679
your balls

01:17:42.679 --> 01:17:46.520

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:49.120
look when you have orange pubic

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:52.320

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:55.239
hair as a as a shock of red hair yeah if

01:17:57.719 --> 01:17:59.920
described as a shock to people you would

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.080

me is that I've watched you chain smoke

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.120
would make your skin look bad and yet

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.320
your skin is immaculate stretched out

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.880
