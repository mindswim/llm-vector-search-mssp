of those things where they hold you up

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.680

the gravitational pull between people

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.200

and i'm like sitting there like every

00:21:59.679 --> 00:22:00.799
now and again one of my cousins would

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:02.559
just be staring at me because i would

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:03.760
just be like this for like two minutes

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.280
like

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.559
and i looked up to like my cousin from

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:08.480
across the table just being like i look

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.720
at them like what up and they're like

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.120
like all right yeah so how how well do

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.640
you know that cousin

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.240
pretty well they probably think you're

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.000
oh my god that's that was what that's

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.280
what my paranoia was starting to base

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.640
around that my family thought i was like

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.720
a drug freak yeah because i would like

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.919
it you know and brittany had a couple

00:22:23.919 --> 00:22:26.400
pops so like she was like starting to

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.799
fade on me a little so that was my main

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:30.400
thing i was like

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.880
are we too up for this wedding

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.799
and i was like dude

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:36.400
 we failed as a couple dude we were

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.080
 and then like i was

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.320
like and then you know again i like

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.679
but i would like oscillate between that

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:43.039
and like nah dude you're totally i have

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:45.200
been too up for several weddings

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.120
yeah but you don't know that's the thing

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.640
but when you i rolled an ankle at a

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.520
wedding

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.440
fell down on the front yard that's the

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.039
difference between drinking and doing

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:55.360
like you know light true uh

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.520
hallucinogens at a point dude i might

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.360
toss that out as the uh

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.960
the challenge of this summer

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.880
hallucinogenic wedding challenge

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.280
dude it's so fun it it was a

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.480
blast again there was a change with

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.640
little bits of paranoia but dude i would

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.679
sit there and like there's nothing

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:11.520
better than a wedding drunk

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.600
getting up in a wedding hitting

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.039
the dance floor on a weed gummy and some

00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:16.559
mushrooms that's when you got to take a

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:18.559
bus back to the hotel with everybody

00:23:18.559 --> 00:23:20.240
sure you get on one of those i dip no i

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.400
really

00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:30.080
but i also thought it was somewhat of a

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.679
false flag because i didn't i only had a

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:33.200
vape pen on me so i think someone was

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.799
just trying to conjure up the beef on me

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:37.360
that'd probably be bill wasn't bill not

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.799
that sounds like although i did have

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:40.159
weed gummy so they might have stone

00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:42.080
called me i don't know but people do

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.520
people were on my ass from the beginning

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.039

00:26:59.919 --> 00:27:01.760
dude i just rose up against some trouble

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.919
the elders of the family dude

00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:05.679
the elders of the family he went out and

00:27:05.679 --> 00:27:08.640
danced by yourself

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.799
with my newfound moves dude

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:12.000
you got some good moves though i'll give

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.919
you that dude you thought i did and i

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:15.360
thought i i always thought i kind of

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.279
stunk but dude now that i'm equipped

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:19.120
with my next challenge i got to go to a

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.200
bipark wedding i do want you to know the

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.600
time in chicago when you danced at that

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.840
person of color circus yes

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.080
the universal circus yes

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.000
uh and they picked you out of the

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.520
audience to dance she was racist the

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.440
white man this will be funny they tried

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.200
to clown on you they did and then the

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.679
crowd went crazy when you hit the moves

00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:39.760
yeah have you ever seen a video of a

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.520
autistic kid at a high school in a

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.799
dance-off

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:44.880
and the crowd goes oh

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.360
no matter what they do

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.760
i am afraid that that could have been

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.520
what happened to you no i killed it i

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.039
killed it well that's exactly what the

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:56.000
autistic kid at the high school had

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.799
so

00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:58.320
you got to be careful because it could

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.240
have been that now i saw the moves

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.799
but i think i also might be working my

00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:04.640
footwork was nasty dude

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.919
footwork well i was a little uptight

00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:07.760
that's always the the autistic kids when

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.200
they get in the dance they swing

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.520
the scenes so i hit a couple of those

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.360
i hit a couple of those

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.880
like i hit a couple of ddrs i hit a

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.640

the wedding

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:05.120

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.039
dance what are like my dance portfolio

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:09.200
could you make it in the intro a montage

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.360
of autistic kids dancing in dance

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.200
circles no that would be sad

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.720
dude here's the i do think there

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.799
is a difference i it's just the theory

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:17.840
here's the thing here's the fundamental

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.320
here's the fundamental minds mind switch

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.919
that it's totally doesn't matter of

00:29:21.919 --> 00:29:23.520
course because no

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.919
exactly when i was there it was like all

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:27.919
the grumpiness and weirdness i would do

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:29.200
when i would sit there and be like why

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.799
does she want to make me dance i don't

00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:33.120
want to dance yeah i'm like i'm just

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.320
going to get out there not even for

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.399
myself just add to the vibe of the party

00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:38.159
and i did yeah

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:39.520
i might have freaked out you know my

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.039
family might be taught might be like i

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:42.640
start out as a grumpus

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.080
i started out

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.240
i don't get like pouty i'm just like i'm

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.760
not dancing and it's not a big

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.120
deal go dance yeah i'm gonna get

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.559
hammered and then i get hammered and i'm

00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:53.600
like what am i doing i should get it

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.039
that's the standard move yeah which

00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:58.000
again that rules too coming in once i

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.480

rip i see fly out of my seat that's a

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.039
good idea that's a good bait song for

00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:10.640
dracula next time you get the touch

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.039

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.840
telling you if you're

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.080
self-aware of bombs dancing and just i

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.360

i'm equipped with the rhythm dude my two

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.120
steps unstoppable right now

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.519
my here's my challenge for myself

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:21.440
don't stop the bypass

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.200
dance challenge no i am the bypass

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.360
wedding the bipark wedding i'm going to

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.880
i believe in july

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.559
no microdoses i'm going to try to do it

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:29.840
stone sober and go out there and just

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.640
dance my ass off i promise that's

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.799
impossible that's what i think that's

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:36.240
dude it's been keeping me up but

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.760
impossible is nothing dude you could

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.840
sober dance at a bypak wedding i'm i'll

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.360
be like probably probably the only white

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.120
dude definitely i'm gonna go out there

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.000
dude

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.679
stone sober definitely the only white

00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:47.919
dude dancing by himself true if you go

00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:49.840
dude if there's a circle

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.039
i'll join into it dude i could do it

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.559
again get it into the circle perhaps

00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:54.000
more of a train but it may be a circle

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.880
too

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.240
might be more of a two-line structure i

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:56.960
don't know if i don't know if the

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.399
circle's gonna happen there's not much

00:31:58.399 --> 00:32:00.000
of a circle there because everybody like

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.519
the circle's usually it's it's kind of

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.559
like a

00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:04.240
let's say a whiter defense mechanism to

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.279
be like

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:06.720
you suck out like no i'm i'm

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.000
participating but then you're just like

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.519
you go do it and then you kind of watch

00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:11.440
yeah dude you're a black wedding it's

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.120
the opposite you're gay if you

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.880
don't dance people are like what's

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.320
they'll come up and be like

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.440
you're okay

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.679
yeah but there are it's funny because

00:32:19.679 --> 00:32:21.679
there are black people who aren't good

00:32:21.679 --> 00:32:24.320
at dancing and they kind of like just do

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.159
they lean back they just lean back or

00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:27.519
they'll sit i mean yeah they could they

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:29.440
could just sit there you know exactly

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.720
they had that thing on them like you

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.159
know i would dance but i got a

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:34.399
gun yeah i can't i brought a gun to this

00:32:34.399 --> 00:32:36.720
party and have a discharge and kill

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.960
someone here

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.559
but it is funny seeing the black dudes

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:42.000
who like kind of stink at it and they

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.600
will kind of like stand off and you know

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.360
there's the whole you know it's a big

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.360
deal but yeah dude that's my personal

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.720
and again i could

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.159
if you just take a micro dose or two

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:51.679
like like a little like point two point

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:53.840
three dose and go dance or go just to a

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.399
wedding it's fun dude dude i can't it's

00:32:56.399 --> 00:32:58.640
so funny i cannot because it's i can't

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.720
own mushrooms would be fun it's a mental

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.480
shift dude when you take yourself out of

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.159
the equation you're just like i'm just a

of this party and like my personal

00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:10.559

piece of dude so i'm sitting there

i'm at the wedding and

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.440
i'm like you know i'm again i'm like

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.879
there's parts where i was kind of like

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:50.480
sitting there like like that weed gummy

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.240
 took me by storm man that was

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.599
the thing that like turned it into kind

00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:55.599
of a somewhat kind of like dubious

00:34:55.599 --> 00:34:56.879
situation

00:34:56.879 --> 00:34:59.200
and uh

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.599
so i'm sitting there and like dude out

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.119
of the corner of my eye i see this dude

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:04.640
and i could have sworn he was looking at

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.240
me like he's giving him if he's me

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.520
mugging you no here's the thing so i'm

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.119
sitting there and i go i look i look

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:10.720
back and i'm like guys just like staring

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.400
at nothing and i go holy dude's

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.280
like does my mind lightly hallucinate

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.119
judgment all the time like i'm like what

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:18.880
the second i'm like i'll like see

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.800
this this was like a weird thing i kind

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.839
of experienced while i was there i was

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:24.560
like i think i mildly hallucinate in my

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.480
waking hours like judgmental looks and

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.960
stuff that just don't exist my mind just

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.800
projects them out onto people and then i

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.119
just sat there being like

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:34.640
and you're waking an hour

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.880
yeah like like apparently

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.400
now i've read about this before but like

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.599
people will like

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:41.839
minorly hallucinate little things that

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:42.800
like just

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.640
didn't happen at all

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.000
like you'll read like a sign you could

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.200
have sworn it said something else you

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.160
look at it again you're like well my

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.079
mind just literally projected on there

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:51.680
so i think i was like i think i do that

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.200
a lot well i think i think that's

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.359
probably if i had to guess just to hunt

00:35:55.359 --> 00:35:57.520
like that's how your mind works yeah

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.200
you're interpreting every single

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.760
person's face towards you exactly so you

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.280
probably get some wrong

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.640
and then sometimes when you're nuts it's

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.560
just totally wrong all the time yeah but

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.839
like what are you looking and how you

00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:09.119
fill in like you know like when you look

00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:10.560
at that thing where it's like the is it

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.640
a candle or is it two faces that kind of

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.000
thing and really it's neither it's just

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.079
this blob that you kind of assign

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:17.520
yeah it's just a bunch of yeah

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.880
so i think like that's what they kind of

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.839
talked about i caught it out of the

00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:22.240
corner of my eye and my mind was like

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.640
put in the picture of a guy

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.760
and i looked and they wasn't even

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.280
looking at me and i was like

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.940
how often do i hallucinate judgment

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.560
[Laughter]

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.880
oh man i gotta hit the floor i bet he

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.400
was looking at you he was definitely

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.680
looking at me like damn this guy's as

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.120
high as i saw you like

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:43.380
[Laughter]

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:46.320
i had to go home i was in down in tamper

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.920
what you're doing somebody i ate a wheat

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.599
edible somebody gave me

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:51.920
yeah i was crushing beers crushing the

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.320
brewskis chilling having a good time a

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.079
dude was a

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:58.640
emt and you're a surgeon i think he was

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.720
telling me about just horrific

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.000
stories

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
just horrific like

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.160
terrible injuries and surgeries and

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.160
then the weed edibles hit and i was just

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.920
like i started doing this i was like

00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:15.040
as soon as i realized i was doing this

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.480
like wild talk like a guy was talking to

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.880
me and i was like

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.960
i have to go home i was like i gotta go

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.800
home right now put yourself to bed yeah

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.760
and everyone

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.280
a bunch of the people like no stay and

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.280
then the manager came out was like no he

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.320
should leave

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.000
he's got a show tomorrow he's got to

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.079
leave right now i was like thank you how

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:33.920
strong was it i don't know i think i

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.599
could have switched to 10 milligrams

00:37:35.599 --> 00:37:37.520
dude which is nothing that's my beef so

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.280
i got these things i got i got out and i

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.800
was out in chicago but it was enough

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.440
that i was just like i have to leave

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.200
that's dude so i got these things from

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.320
chicago um when i was out for my

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.640
sister-in-law's graduation party there

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.000
it's illegal out there so i went and got

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.599
a bunch of weed gummies flew back with

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:56.240
them you can't stop me and the uh

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.359
dude they say they're 10

00:37:57.359 --> 00:37:59.680
milligrams i'll like eat half of them

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.960
and again you know being on a microdose

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.040
ramps them up but even the one day i ate

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.440
one when i was uh in chicago for the

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.400
graduation party dude i was stuck

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.320
i was like these have to have more yeah

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.400
stop me right in my tracks dude yeah i

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.079
was like sauteing true i got these

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:16.000
edibles out of like a lady's truck in

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.240
tampa dude she they tried to give me a

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.160
joint and i was like i don't i'm not

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.200
gonna smoke and she was like i have some

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.040
edibles and i was like yeah i'll

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.560
yeah i'll have one of those i just got

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.760
it out of like a ladies glove

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.520
compartment well here's the thing it was

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.760
probably like 150

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.839
this package says 100 but i always

00:38:31.839 --> 00:38:34.160
thought it's 100 total so it's like and

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.200
they're definitely not 100 but they're

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.440
supposed to be 10 a piece yeah dude

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.800
these things were like knocking

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.320
my socks off and then that's when i when

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.680
i had the half of one at a wedding i was

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.200
like oh you have

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.520
dude still rocky pluto bro

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.880
i was just sitting there like what the f

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.320
but what happens too is when you mix

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.760
them because it's like a jelly mixture

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.599
yeah so you pour in like if you're using

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:53.359
i've had some of your gummies exactly so

00:38:53.359 --> 00:38:54.480
you're using like every once in a while

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.720
you hit a landmine exactly

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.200
because because it's like water and oil

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.320
and then if you're using distillate

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.599
obviously it's a little different but a

00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:03.040
lot of times like you're just mixing

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.800
sludge so like there's nothing stopping

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.560
if it's distillated or if it's like a

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.920
coconut oil

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.520
it's gonna concentrate in certain areas

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.640
so something yeah sometimes you eat when

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.480
it's a dud sometimes you eat when you go

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.560
this is like four yeah this is a major

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.720
problem this is a major one so i

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.960
remember how macky used to tr he used to

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.040
crush those crush him man that's

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.480
weird well here's the thing a lot of

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.079
times you know some people right mackie

00:39:24.079 --> 00:39:27.520
all right p mackie former friend

ubi

00:44:49.359 --> 00:44:51.760
it kind of accepted based on cheering

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.760
just for having it's rewarding having

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.400
children and making less money huh i

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.079
know that's kind of how welfare works

00:44:58.079 --> 00:44:59.359
but

00:44:59.359 --> 00:45:00.800
i think we're gonna run into a lot of

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.880
people being like i'm not gonna work

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.920
oh yeah and that's that's trouble

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.200
i know these sound like conservative

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.520
values but it also could be reality what

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.599
if the society was underpinned by like a

00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:12.880
lot of people not trying to be

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.079
productive yeah and then everybody's

00:45:14.079 --> 00:45:16.160
talking about like inflation and yeah

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.599
seems like kind of the worst thing to do

00:45:17.599 --> 00:45:19.359
if we're facing inflation is just keep

00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:22.079
printing money and sending it to yeah

00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:23.599
everybody yeah i'll be curious to see

00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:25.119
what happens it's time for

00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:26.960
now this isn't exactly what i'm saying

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.400

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.240

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.400
you identified as a person of color

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.319
and she's like yes he was like what do

00:46:32.319 --> 00:46:34.319
you think about the vaccine do you have

00:46:34.319 --> 00:46:36.800
access to it she's like yeah you know

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:37.760
he's like

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.680
do you think that school should require

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.920
children to all get vaccinated and if

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.680
not they cannot go to school and i'm in

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.599
the back like what the is this like

00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:47.839
do you agree one to five do you agree

00:46:47.839 --> 00:46:48.720
that

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.960
uh everybody should get it under 12

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.800
years old and that it is very safe and

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.480
that you should get it every year as

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.400
opposed to i'm sitting there being like

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.839
what kind of market research

00:46:57.839 --> 00:46:59.040
what kind of and then and then he would

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.280
stop at between every like four like

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.280
super creepy dystopian questions you

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.200
would stop and be like uh do you agree

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.800
that it is uh people of color are

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.880
disadvantaged

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.200
okay so should children be forced to get

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.960
the vaccine in order to play the sports

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.160
and i'd be sitting there like dude this

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.160
is crazy

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.520
i think the narrative they got going

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.760
right now is like don't let the man tell

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.079
you can't get the vaccine yeah yeah yeah

00:47:22.079 --> 00:47:23.200
so there yeah they're playing to this

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.040
whole thing of like be revolutionary and

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.960
step up i might get it

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.280
i'm addicted to it dude the vex hey i've

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.480
gotten it like

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.920
i've been very closeted about it i've

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.599
been very closeted about it i've gotten

00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:35.040
all of them i'm thinking about getting

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.720
it i've gotten all of them but you know

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.000
i haven't got it yet it's because i'm

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.359
lazy

00:47:39.359 --> 00:47:40.559
yeah i haven't got it because i'm

00:47:40.559 --> 00:47:42.319
genuinely i don't take advil i

00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:44.079
don't take tylenol or advil so like here

00:47:44.079 --> 00:47:45.599
take this i'm like

00:47:45.599 --> 00:47:46.640
i'll wait

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.079
i'll wait for it also don't want to jump

00:47:48.079 --> 00:47:49.280
the line bro you know i want to make

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.200
sure everyone who's more vulnerable

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.559
vulnerable than you can get it so i'm

00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:54.000
going to wait another

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.480
65 years probably yeah and then i'll you

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.559
know maybe consider it yeah but they're

00:47:58.559 --> 00:48:00.559
they're now talking about

00:48:00.559 --> 00:48:02.319
what i got from that robocall they're

00:48:02.319 --> 00:48:04.880
gonna try to like do a two-for-one flu

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.880
kovid shot and they're going to start

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.400
trying to give it out to people once a

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.520
year

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.640
so

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.160
that's that's what i got from the thing

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.680
but i think they're also trying to

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.440
really pump up kids to get it too they

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.280
would be sick if that's how america

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.599
collapsed that if the vaccine ended up

00:48:19.599 --> 00:48:22.319
just wiping everyone out in like a year

00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:24.640
it's possible what a catastrophic

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.240
failure of an empire yeah that would

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.680
stink that'd be pretty sick just be like

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.400
jonestown except the whole country

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.000
just everyone just laying down dead and

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.480
then just patriots emerge patriots and

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.760
black dudes emerge

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.359
true dude well that's the other thing

00:48:37.359 --> 00:48:38.720
too a lot of the stuff a lot of the

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.400
stuff i read is like

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.599
they talk about like they call it

00:48:41.599 --> 00:48:43.920
vaccine hesitation apparently too i

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.280
think they also

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.680
now they include annie vaxxer as people

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.079
who are against mandated vaccines if

00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:50.880
that makes sense they're like well

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.359
that's an anti-vaxxer it's like

00:48:53.359 --> 00:48:55.280
i got shots i just people like hey

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.359
here's a new one take it now i'm like

00:48:57.359 --> 00:48:59.280
yeah hold on let me go hold up i just

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.559
believe in science so i'm like let's let

00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:02.480
the scientific process on play in its

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.599
fullest i want to do more of a

00:49:03.599 --> 00:49:05.920
meta-analysis on everyone who gets it

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.839
first but you know again i just

00:49:07.839 --> 00:49:09.839
love science dude i love science too

00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:11.920
youtube don't do platforms true we love

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.160

thigh or does it have to be the arm

because my veins my veins are already

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.079
dude they're

00:49:24.079 --> 00:49:25.280

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.960
when someone's veiny

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:27.760

was in fifth grade all i cared about

00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:36.160

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.800
we're not taking the backs we're back

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.880
 youtube

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.880
i got too many veins

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.319
yeah i don't know again i think people

00:50:08.319 --> 00:50:09.839
should do what they want again i'm i'm

00:50:09.839 --> 00:50:11.680
right now battling addiction to the

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.520
vaccine i bet it's all right to take

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.599
most people are fine i had to guess most

00:50:15.599 --> 00:50:17.680
people are fine they're

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.000
hoss has been sending me some research

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.160
i don't trust his research it's it's

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.680
based off the cdc

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.200
and it's nothing crazy it's just the

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.640
unexplained deaths kind of jumped

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.640
significantly um

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.480
you know but

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.920
you know from 500 to 30 what's

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.839
interesting is right now my mom dad and

00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:36.160
sister all have colds

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.920
really and then i think my dad did like

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.839
a doctor over the phone thing yeah i

00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:41.040
mean the doctor was like no you guys

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.640
just have colds you're fine

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.160
i was like dude three months ago they

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.079
would have been like you have coveted

00:50:46.079 --> 00:50:48.480
definitely get out of the house yeah

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.839
yeah man i think we're we're coming out

00:50:49.839 --> 00:50:52.559
of it but they want to hit that 70 mark

00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:53.920
so they're to start vaccinating the

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.960
chair in

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.720
and once they hit that 70 mark then it's

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.160
kind of like all right we'll just start

00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.200
selling the every year it'll make

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.880
the flu shot in two years it'll be like

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.000
you know you don't get the flu shot and

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.680
nobody gives a yeah it'll be like

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.280
that in a couple years man

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.800
but you know for now

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.559
the funny part is the masks like people

00:51:08.559 --> 00:51:10.079
don't know what to do this is tough

00:51:10.079 --> 00:51:11.520
people know what to do with themselves i

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.839
i feel i still feel a little like i

00:51:13.839 --> 00:51:15.440
should be wearing a mask outside you

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.440
don't have to i know of course outside i

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.119
oh within that but if i walk in

00:51:19.119 --> 00:51:20.559
somewhere i'm like i have to wear this

00:51:20.559 --> 00:51:22.160
well i just i just launched a pretty

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.599
decent experiment and i was at a wedding

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.400
a tough date for a bay it seems like a

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.760
good idea and then you're in the third

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:06.960
inning and you've been there for three

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.319

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.200
flying with weed somewhere else just

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.920
ruining a trip over like four vapes i

00:58:54.799 --> 00:58:56.000
medical card

and then i'm allowed to have in chicago

00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.960
because everyone can have yeah but in

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.960
the air

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.559
you just don't bust that's the one you

00:59:02.559 --> 00:59:04.240
just don't vape in the bathroom it's

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.680
gonna be so hard

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.599
it's tempting but it's gonna be so hard

00:59:07.599 --> 00:59:09.280
not to i don't really have a desire to

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:11.359
be stoned on a plane i wonder if you hit

00:59:11.359 --> 00:59:12.960
it and then blew it in the toilet and

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.200
pressed flush it's possible you know but

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.319
if anyone smells dude they're fried i

00:59:18.319 --> 00:59:19.680
i've gone through it you can eat this

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.119
land of the plane

00:59:21.119 --> 00:59:22.720
maybe piss yeah they could land the

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.040
plane they would probably kind of be

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.880
like just because no one wants it

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.480
they're like just talking

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:29.920
especially

00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:31.520
that's one of my i do want to do that i

00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.559

00:59:32.559 --> 00:59:34.000
get older i want to just ground one

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.079
plane just light up a cigar and just sit

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.440
localized saying it's like a local sound

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.960
it's good for me to correct someone and

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.240
then not know what the i'm talking

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:35.920
about either but yeah like a saying

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.760
you can get wrong like that sure like

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.319
packing the gills oh yeah you know

01:06:40.319 --> 01:06:41.359
because it makes sense in your head

01:06:41.359 --> 01:06:44.360
you're like shoving things in gills

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.000
[Laughter]

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.319
you know packed to the gills

01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:50.000
so they were at this they're at the mega

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.119
gog

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.240
what the man

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.160

does anyone know that doubt it

01:07:18.799 --> 01:07:20.480
i'm really worried about israel right

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.000
now in palestine the fact that they're

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.760
gathering like that without being

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.280
properly vaccinated in close quarters

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.599
were they all six feet apart at least

01:07:27.599 --> 01:07:28.880
no way

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.599
no way oh dude 600 of them that building

01:07:31.599 --> 01:07:34.000
wasn't even being built yet the capacity

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.119
of the gills must have been 80.

that too

01:07:43.599 --> 01:07:45.119
that happens

01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:46.559
it looks like they fell in like a wave

01:07:46.559 --> 01:07:48.240
like they went down and they were like

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.880

oh my god dude yeah it's just

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.260

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:30.000
[Laughter]

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.199
we can watch

01:08:31.199 --> 01:08:33.679
at least 200 people were killed

01:08:33.679 --> 01:08:35.520
oh then it turns into a stampede there's

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.359
there's the back

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:39.520

01:08:44.719 --> 01:08:48.080
yeah the bleachers went down dude yeah

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.440
i was always weary of that i was

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.199

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.920
[Laughter]

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.279

01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:04.839
make

01:09:04.839 --> 01:09:06.880
jokes but i think there's probably a

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.759
collective like oh

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.719

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.239
gonna be funny at all it's not funny at

01:09:18.239 --> 01:09:20.239
all i'm saying just like the trump flag

01:09:20.239 --> 01:09:21.920
from a legal person jumping behind there

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.199
it was like it's not funny it's like in

01:09:23.199 --> 01:09:26.799
fact it's so funny that it's not funny

01:09:26.799 --> 01:09:28.000
there's a lot of things like that i'm

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.120
talking about from that's got to be a

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.120
legal nightmare dude yeah a synagogue

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.480
collapsing

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.560
can you imagine that case in court oh my

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.480
 everyone's getting a piece of

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.759
everyone's ass dude

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.400
people like i don't even know what's

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.679
occurring right now

01:09:45.679 --> 01:09:47.759
everybody well that guy elbowed me as he

01:09:47.759 --> 01:09:49.279
felt i think everybody in israel

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:51.520
tomorrow is gonna be a neck brace

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.719
for you there it's like yeah

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.400
look at me on ubi after that the whole

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.320
country

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.480
that's not funny that's not funny at all

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.400
dude but i love that now that palestine

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.560
and israel at war and the left supports

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:11.199
palestine we can be anti-semitic again

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.360
yeah well it's funny too like

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.199
it it's just it's just a group of people

01:10:17.199 --> 01:10:18.480
you can make fun of like any other group

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.239
of people but they were off the table

01:10:20.239 --> 01:10:21.920
for a while they were off the table

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.040
because it all depends on everything

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:23.840
else

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.440
i made i said the italians were pigs i

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.880
said eat like pigs yeah

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.159
then the juice fell off the bleachers

01:10:28.159 --> 01:10:30.320
and it just yeah here's always there's

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.600
an interesting one

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.400
where

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.000
something like with tony hitchcliff

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.080
happens yes and he says that word that

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.480
 unspeakable thing that

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.440
destroyer of all worlds that word

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.280
uh

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.960
and

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.320
then there's always a comment of like

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.920
well what if it was black people that he

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.520
said it about yeah what if it was the

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.640
n-word

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.000
it's like all right well what if it was

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.120
mick

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.679
yeah what if it was yeah if you want

01:10:55.679 --> 01:10:56.960
to do that game

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.480
yeah of course because then they have to

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.239
be like well that's different that's not

01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:02.480
as bad and it's like oh

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.800
your rules not mine so they vary so they

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.040
do vary perhaps they obviously do dude

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:07.840
yeah

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.679
it's yeah this is general consensus

01:11:09.679 --> 01:11:11.440
stuff they obviously do yeah

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.880
it's like you know

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.480
yeah i mean though the problem is the

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.679
problem is is when there's there's

01:11:15.679 --> 01:11:18.080
people who genuinely genuinely are like

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.480
i hate screaming people and it's

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.480
like that stinks but it ruins it for

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.679
everybody else just trying to have a fun

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.760
josh on everyone we were i was talking

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.199
to your brother william yeah about dudes

01:11:29.199 --> 01:11:31.199
saying the n-word yeah stand up and i

01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:33.199
was like you have no idea how often that

01:11:33.199 --> 01:11:34.880
happens they just rap like a dude coming

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.719
on stage at an open mic and being like

01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:38.000
what's up everybody and then it hit in

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.239
the end where it just disappearing open

01:11:40.239 --> 01:11:43.440
microscope just the guy

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.520
showing up being like all right i'm

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.600
gonna fast-forward it my career is over

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.679
right now my first mic

01:11:49.679 --> 01:11:51.040

open micros if you go to an open mic and

own creature yeah there's a lot of

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.360
creatures at an open mic and that's a

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.159
very distinctive scorpion of open mic
