the marquee and it was like people were

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.559
[ __ ] stoked yeah it's like jackie

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.760
robinson

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.000
rosa parks martin luther king it was

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.920
horrible comic book movie yeah it was up

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.360
there dude

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.119
people are reaching so hard to be part

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.880
of a civil rights movement right now

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.960
yeah it's [ __ ] it's weird but this

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.640
the movie was literally there was maybe

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.159
me and one other white dude in there and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.799
we were in cherry hill too yeah so cause

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.680
everyone's like where'd you see the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.200
movie i saw it in like north philly it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.880
was crazy dude i was in cherry hill and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.040
i was like the only white dude in there

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.400
well that's because white people are

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.720
they're also expecting the culture right

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.560
now and you you got to understand as a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.720
white person and i i assume our listener

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.840
is white

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.520
don't go see black panther yet let them

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.720
have this

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.560
you gotta go you gotta show respect to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.240
their culture and maybe wait a week you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.159
gotta go right now it's all sold out the

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.759
last thing they need is more colonists

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.000
in that theater dude you gotta go in

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.840
that white you have to go out

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.680
no don't see black panther you got to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.119
see it dude all right

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.000
how's it going doing good it's good nice

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.680
i i went to go see it but it was sold

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.479
out until thursday well like it's like

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.840
all the other stuff it's good you watch

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.600
it it's cool and then it's like it taps

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.360
into that

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.959
uh like the current movement of being

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.480
like calling white dudes colonists and

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.080
being like the white guy tries to speak

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.680
and they're like

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.120
and they don't let them speak wait they

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.760
bark at him yeah and like they like do

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.200
like it's really weird and then like

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.400
well they got that right that's kind of

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.239
realistic but you watch you watch it

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.520
look outside i'm like hey how are you

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.720
like

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.400
all right all right well you watch it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.000
and it's just kind of like

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.520
you watch you see the thing then you try

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.120
to explain it to someone who's not white

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.720
and they're or like

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.840
maybe they are white like what are you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.360
talking about but it's i'm like dude

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.720
there's something weird and they're like

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.080
well that's how it felt for us and it's

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.040
like

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.120
i guess man i don't know it just feels

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.200
like a weird thing to do and everyone's

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.720
like that's the point of the movie it's

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.160
like supposed to make you feel like it's

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.599
supposed to be a [ __ ] comic book

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.599
movie yeah it's like uh all right i

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.040
tried to i've been trying to sell that

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.360
at shows we did an all black show last

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.519
week and i was like he's like hey guys

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.879
you know black panther is gonna [ __ ]

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.000
suck right

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.080
no they were like what i was like dude

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.440
unless you're a little kid or you have

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.280
half a brain it's a [ __ ] comic book

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.360
movie you're an adult yeah but the whole

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.480
thing is that it's just it's a

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.040
mainstream movie and it's like an

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.519
all-black cast so it's like a milestone

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.360
dude and that black iron man has to be

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.800
sitting there like what the [ __ ] guys

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.480
there's no black eyes

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.720
where [ __ ] don cheadle

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.879
oh yeah he well he's like iron man's

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.440
[ __ ] helper dude

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.680
he made up 10 of the iron man franchise

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.720
accurately

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.159
you wouldn't think he'd make it an

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.959
appearance in there though also uh

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.239
if i were if i were black i would have

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.159
celebrated django a lot harder than i

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.000
celebrated black panther what was jenga

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.080
oh did you go unchained yeah but this

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.640
was black cast black director white

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.360
production company marvel white owner

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.440
yeah dudes yeah

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.159
yeah

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.480
yeah but i mean i get why people are i

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.159
get why people are stoked off it that's

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.360
the weirdest thing too that was the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.560
thing i was trying to figure out i'm

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.680
like

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.760
is this

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.080
is this just like kind of click bait e

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.920
where like it's it's not even made like

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.200
whenever it's like oh that's the design

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.799
it's made it's it's like or is it just

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.239
made for people to talk about and write

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.760
on the internet and get outraged about

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.599
and it's like that's my whole thing with

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.640
all of those who's getting outraged

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.159
about it dude there's a lot of bad movie

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.599
reviews who were like [ __ ] this movies

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.160
movies [ __ ]

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.680
it's it's a comic book it's a comic book

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.840
movie so it's like it sucks on the level

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.880
of like

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.120
if you don't like comic book movies yeah

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.680
it's like again i said it's like go if

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.240
you want to see black panther just watch

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.240
any spider-man movie and just listen to

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.479
kendrick lamar while you watch it yeah

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.240
it's the same [ __ ] movie yeah it's

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.759
pretty similar to that it's like it was

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.080
like cgi garbage with kendrick lamar

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.479
playing it was the most uh like it was

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.199
like the most they

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.040
the plot was the most like intricate

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.639
it's been from which usually they're

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.720
very linear where it's like dude

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.160
something bad happens comes back they

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.800
had like a anti-hero thing going on with

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.919
michael b

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.560
nice jack nick cannon dude i thought

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.320
that was nick cannon for like

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.080
six months yeah it's spider-man with

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.919
kendrick lamar and you got to sit next

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.680
to a guy from trenton new jersey and a

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.680
[ __ ] dashiki

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.440
yeah that's it

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.919
yeah it was my take on it it was so

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.520
weird it's such a weird i don't know i

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.199
can't i can't even like

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.560
i was because i thought about it a lot

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.160
because i was like i left and i watched

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.360
it and i was like

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.720
god that's so [ __ ] annoying and then

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.680
if you tell people that they're like

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.120
well that's you know that you just you

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.880
can't handle it and it's like

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.479
i don't really care there just seems

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.759
like there's something really weird

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.919
going on there is there's something off

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.919
there's something bad about it it's like

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.080
the same thing with get out except i bet

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.400
this is worse a way worse movie than get

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.840
out

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.440
well they're impossible for me to watch

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.800
because i analyze them i sit there and

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.880
i'm like watching it like the [ __ ]

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.320
going on i'm like the white version of

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.360
the dude from doing the right thing

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.880
who's wearing like the africa fish shirt

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.000
and they're like dude shut the [ __ ] up

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.120
with this [ __ ] i'm like no you got

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.639
to watch it

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.960
but the it is clickbait was the perfect

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.520
example yeah black panther is click bait

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.080
in just movie form yeah but it's it is

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.440
for certain people then if you're black

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.880
you're just like [ __ ] yeah dude finally

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.120
a marvel like if you and i were the

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.720
world and like every movie was like matt

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.240
mccusker matt mccoska and they made the

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.840
shane gilles movie you'd be like [ __ ]

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.120
yeah let's go we're gonna watch this

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.800
that's that's i get that that's the

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.319
problem it's too

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.840
there's too many groups of different

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.199
things going into it like for white

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.720
people when i'm talking a white guy like

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.160
oh my god this best movie ever saw i'm

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.520
just kind of like

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.280
was it bro yeah then if you're like if

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.400
i'm talking like a black dude who was

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.000
like i was so excited for black panther

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.360
i'm like you probably were [ __ ]

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.800
stoked and you probably really enjoyed

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.440
it

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.560
if movies were all if it was all medea

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.479
movies forever and one day it was just

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.880
like white dude movie you'd be like yo

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.479
bring the [ __ ] kids there's a white

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.000
guy movie we're [ __ ] seeing this

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.400
thing that part i do get i don't think

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.240
it is only oh i guess if you're a comic

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.240
book fan sure exactly like marvel

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.000
definitely black movies not like

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.199
mainstream though because i kept trying

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.319
to think of like mainstream media

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.240
training day

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.000
that's bla that's not a black movie this

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
denzel is the black dude there's a lot

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.759
of [ __ ] black people in that yeah but

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:00.479
it's not a black movie though

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.160
there's like movies have you ever

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.840
watched a medea movie yeah of course

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.840
that's a black movie

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.319
training day which is training day

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.280
but i

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.319
all right

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.919
i mean denzel's the main point of

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.520
youtube you're making you're making the

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.880
right choice of sitting this out what do

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.199
you

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.560
did you watch if you went to medea or

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.680
training day would you there's a

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.199
different vibe when you go in i'm not

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:24.720
saying baby boy

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.720
baby boy was a black movie baby boy was

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.520
a black movie um

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.919
i don't know i i just the idea of

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.360
separating us into these groups

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.960
constantly yeah

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.240
that's weird being like that's a black

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.520
movie that's a white movie it's like how

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.880
about they're just [ __ ] moving media

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.400
is a black movie though though media is

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.639
a black movie yeah for sure but now it's

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:44.479
weird that's that's the weirdest thing

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:45.840
like i really

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.599
the weirdest part about it to where it's

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:49.199
like

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:50.720
well this is important finally but it's

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.720
like movies are decided by the market

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.240
it's like these guys who are filming

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.520
these aren't like we need to make a

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.280
change they're like how much money can i

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.599
make when these things start making lots

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:01.520
of money then it's like but people are

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.120
paying for the tickets but it's like why

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.440
dude yeah there's a weird like white

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.360
masochistic element to where it's like

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.120
give me my punishment i'll sit through

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.039
black panther and it's like it's weird

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:12.960
man the whole thing makes me feel weird

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.560
yeah but you talked to him you talked to

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.080
like like last night i was talking to

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.680
two black ladies about this and it was

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.759
just they were like [ __ ] you

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:21.840
boo hoo [ __ ] off and i was just like you

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.080
guys don't understand well maybe they

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.960
don't

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.479
exactly because it was super because

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:27.440
they're black doesn't mean they're not

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.280
allowed to be [ __ ] dumb

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.039
what do you mean like you're allowed to

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:32.560
be just be like oh yeah you guys just

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.000
don't understand what's happening right

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.800
now

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.760
yeah

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.120
wait what are you gonna like put kid

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.479
gloves on they're like well maybe it's

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:39.839
just because it's their black experience

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:41.440
and this is really fun for them or it's

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.039
like maybe they're kind of [ __ ] dumb

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.880
and they're acting like a [ __ ]

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.600
cartoon is a civil rights movement

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.000
yeah but i i honestly get that part of

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.839
it that part i do understand to where

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:54.000
it's like if you never have if you have

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.440
one day if you're a marvel person and

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.880
it's just like now they're making a

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.880
marvel person yes yeah

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.160
even if you're even if you're just like

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.080
this is going to be sick dude

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.760
they're going to make a mainstream

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.600
hollywood production that

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.040
they spend so much [ __ ] money on this

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.600
movie yeah and it shattered box rock box

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.320
office records yeah because

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.080
people don't really

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.680
care about like it's not like we need

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.480
white people in a [ __ ] car

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.080
comic book movie yeah but it doesn't

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.640
think about why like why would that

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.640
shatter records like because the

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.399
market's the thing that this is feeding

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.480
this is a it's all just numbers and it's

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.000
like why the [ __ ] is that selling so

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.600
many tickets because like you said like

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.519
it's iron man did okay but this black

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.600
panther just like blew the [ __ ] out of

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.200
the water well it's

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.760
because no black people were required to

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.160
see it culturally yeah so you have every

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.600
single black person in america that had

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.160
to go see uh black panther yeah and then

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.360
white people that also feel obligated

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.560
culturally

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.080
if you'll watch it you have to go see

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.279
it's one of those movies where people

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:56.959
like i've had like so many people ask me

00:09:56.959 --> 00:09:58.399
you see black panther i'm like yeah so

00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.920
but if you're like nah

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.120
like i've talked to i talked to my

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.880
friend the other day and he was like he

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.399
was this black dude he felt bags he

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:05.839
bootlegged it he was like my friend was

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:07.839
like man you're going to bootleg black

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:09.040
panther bro and he's like i'm going to

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.560
get i'll go get a ticket but yeah i just

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.839
want to watch it in the house nah

00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:13.519
[ __ ] bootleg well that was the funny

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:14.640
part there is something really

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.360
culturally like it is like almost like

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.240
sac religious to like bootleg it or not

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.360
see it

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.320
because there's a thing where like

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.200
you're like oh man you're like

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.640
supporting you know but yeah again

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.320
you're really supporting like so

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.160
hollywood's fine [ __ ] weinstein at

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.360
the top yeah that's who you're

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.720
supporting well i think it is a

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.120
weinstein picture probably

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.399
i mean it's one of those if that came

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:35.760
out that would be the ultimate if

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.760
they're like it was actually harvey if

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.440
harvey weinstein made the most money off

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.200
that well that's the that's the weirdest

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.959
right to me now or to me now that's the

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:45.040
weirdest thing of like so you have like

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.760
the

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.279
the liberal tract of being like this is

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.720
the most powerful this is the best movie

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.240
they have people just kind of like

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.920
hoping like i hope this movie [ __ ]

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.480
sucks people suck exactly so it's weird

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.000
to think like

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.440
so there's two people trying to have

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.040
something that's like this is their own

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.399
reality and every day they're trying to

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:01.839
like see little things like yes i'm

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:03.600
right yes this is that they're like it's

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.279
just weird yeah i mean there's a lot of

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.640
people like that was the best movie i

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.800
ever saw and it's like

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.839
okay

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:11.920
sure i guess it was i don't know yeah

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.079
it's not it's just fun it's not the best

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:15.519
movie i guarantee it it's a [ __ ]

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:17.040
comic book it's a good for a marvel

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.560
movie they spent so much money and they

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.279
did a good job marvel wise but i hate

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:23.600
the cgi in those comic book movies yeah

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.640
so i mean i just it sucks yeah i don't

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.640
like it so then when i hear people put

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.240
this pressure on it that it's going to

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.560
be the greatest

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.240
movie ever and that that it's going to

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.560
be this like landmark

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.320
it's it's just not well i'm just like

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.680
because this is forcing that it's

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.200
building but it's building so it was

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.959
like get out that was like holy [ __ ]

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:44.720
this was awesome they're doing all he

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.079
wasn't awesome i know but they're going

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:47.600
to keep building the momentum of this

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.040
thing and this whole thing's going to

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.640
end with one black dude being like that

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.079
was all right and then they're like [ __ ]

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.279
and then they'll just lose a bunch of

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.880
movies in the pipeline yeah because how

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.399
many times can you replicate the whole

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.079
the whole thing is like

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:00.079
like get out was just like black people

00:12:00.079 --> 00:12:02.800
are treated badly wake up black panther

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.800
was like something similar to that but

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.800
with marvel behind it and it's like i

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.880
keep wondering like when is it gonna

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.480
when people are gonna be like

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.720
all right i've seen this movie i get it

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.639
enough uh apparently it's not gonna

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:15.440
happen

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.600

using the russians we've been using a

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.639

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.080
of going viral so on each episode

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.360
they're like what do you think about

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.960
people kneeling

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.799
every [ __ ] show well that's like

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:44.160
black people need to stand up for

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.000
themselves it's like all right michelle

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.640
beedle you white [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah [ __ ]

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.840
up now everyone's telling me about the

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.679
packers game everyone's checking them oh

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:53.600
she's going on like hard

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.360
necessarily just her but i've seen her a

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.280
couple times so that's that's the weird

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.880
noise that's the weird thing about this

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.559
because there's definitely something in

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:02.400
the air it's like there's this weird

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.840
thing among people where it's like

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.919
social change it's kind of trapped in

00:19:05.919 --> 00:19:08.000
the air and it's like advertising

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.240
advertisers are just like they plug into

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.520
it and they're like yeah you're gonna

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.240
get alexis yeah black people hey man

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.760
it's like look at the black panther huh

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.280
look at this guy how about this he's

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.280
getting alexis 14 lexus yeah it's pretty

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.200
weird to think that like they're and but

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.640
that's the market dictates all that

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.240
stuff so people see that they're like

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.360
lexus is japanese dude they're japanese

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.960
well dude that's it's so weird that

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.679
people get like alexis

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:34.320
the whole the whole idea is to see that

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.720
plug into it by alexis and be like i'm

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.559
somehow weirdly helping civil rights

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:42.480
with this new acura rss the barack

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.039

stuff out of your mind dude it's

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.160
poisonous yeah it's tough to watch start

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.600
always watching [ __ ] with this weird

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.600
filter you know it's wrong but you can't

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.600
really put your finger on why because if

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.960
you say it's wrong everyone's like what

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.640
are you [ __ ] racist it's like no no

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.640
no it's just weird to see

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.280
lexus hop dog pile on this or t-mobile

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.320
be like

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.320
you believe all people should be treated

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.720
equally yeah t-mobile

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.520
what yes exactly no and that's that's

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.440
the like that is the click-baity part of

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.039
it where it's not about like we need to

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:37.200
help people it's like what are people

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.400
yammering on about they're like all

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.559
right we'll get behind that yeah well i

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:42.320
think also too some something that i

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.679
would worry about with stuff like that

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:45.919
is when you're condescending to people

00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:48.480
then there's like a pushback and then

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.080
you're like well you're just creating a

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.000
nightmare scenario for all of us then

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.080
because then we're going to have people

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.159
pushing back on this

00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:58.240
in a way that could

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.080
there that's the that's exactly well no

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.679
no that's not yours that's exactly what

00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:02.559
happened

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:04.159
that's exactly what happened we got

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:06.480
[ __ ] donald trump

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.960
there was and then and then it doubled

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.480
yeah for donald trump the last like year

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.320
and a half we got let him go dude has

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.480

our throats yeah i mean it was

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.640
before trump with hillary it was getting

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.640
rammed down our throats pretty hard and

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.799
with obama when obama got elected it was

00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:26.799

never that made sense i worked

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.159
construction where people being like god

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:34.000
[ __ ] damn it well that means that but

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.679
everyone everything was quiet no one was

00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:38.320
no one well i guess people protested but

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.919
most people i think they had a couple

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:40.960

but not but no not on the scale

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:55.760

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.280
the black guys sports team won and i was

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.120

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.640
throwing this in my face

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.520
i helped i helped yeah that was when he

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.960
got elected i woke up and it was like

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.720
all right black president sick and then

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.039
kept going about my day and then like

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:40.960
ever i remember i was living

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.039

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:44.240
i'm sick

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.400
yeah and then i was just like well back

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.840
to [ __ ] my life

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.520
obama's different and then when we got

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.799
hillary they tried to use the same

00:22:52.799 --> 00:22:56.159
playbook of this is a monumental moment

00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:57.840
yeah and it's like

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.440
yeah well we don't care about women that

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.320
much

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:04.559
it's so [ __ ] chill and then uh

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:06.400
also it wasn't because she was you know

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.919
she had too much dirt on her well that

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:08.960
was the funny thing

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.360
she got caught more or less

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.120
[ __ ] with the elections messing up

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.799
bernie sanders chance and then she's

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:16.159
like the [ __ ] russians colluded

00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:18.000
against me and it's like it's like no

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.679
you did that too i know that's the one

00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:20.960
thing that bothers me the most that is

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.799
funny the conclusion thing the one thing

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:24.559
that really annoys me is

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:26.080
they're just they're like they're mad at

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.760
who blew the whistle

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.559
on

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:29.840
they're not mad about the crime that

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.039
they committed

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:33.360
which was rigging their own election

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.480
which is weird

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.559
i can't believe they caught us

00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:38.080
it's like look who caught us that's not

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.559
good yeah what exactly did you [ __ ]

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:41.840
rigged the election against bernie

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.440
sanders how did she do that i remember

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.039
reading the wikileaks and she basically

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:47.600
said like she got more airtime and they

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.559
well the dnc like pumped her up they

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:52.960
decided oh yeah yeah yeah and they

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.039
[ __ ] him over in like nevada yeah like

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:56.640
a bunch of those she got busted she got

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.400
busted she got busted and then she was

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.679
like these russian mothers it's like

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:02.080
yeah there's like the russians

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.600
that's where i tap out dude that's where

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.200
it's just like well [ __ ] this whole

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.200
thing now is every single piece of

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.799
information you receive off the internet

00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:11.440
or off tv is all fake

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.279
it really is yeah both sides i mean

00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:14.559
donald trump's definitely a [ __ ]

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:16.400
nightmare yeah he's definitely a [ __ ]

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.440
mess

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.120
and it's terrible that he's in office

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.640
but also

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.440
uh just every you there's no honest

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.200
piece of information out there well

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.080
interesting good no please uh on sam

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.279
harris's podcast recently they this guy

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:32.880
niall ferguson or whatever he had an

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.200
interesting counter factual to like if

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.039
clinton had gotten elected

00:24:37.039 --> 00:24:39.600
there would the protests would have been

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.440
insane but they would have been also of

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.039
a different character which is like all

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:44.720
of the ideas that they had that this was

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.799
completely rigged that the clintons are

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:48.480
part of this like world domination thing

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.640
yeah would have been totally

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.480
fitting that narrative yeah and then you

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.240
would have had steve bannon

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.799
without ever having a chance to be in

00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:57.919
power

00:24:57.919 --> 00:25:00.720
um oh hyping that up hyping that up sure

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.240
and that would make him more strong so

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.840
there's something about you have this

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.360
undercurrent happen and then you go okay

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.880
well you actually got it and now you're

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.559
in charge and now let's see what you do

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:10.480
with it well and

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.840
just to tie it into the black panther

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.600
thing i think that there is kind of to

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.440
your point earlier something where it's

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.520
like all right you wanted to do

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.840
this exact type of movie have you know

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.520
yeah humiliate white people in it or

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.799
whatever i don't know if humiliation

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.400
they don't humiliate white people steve

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.440
take it easy

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.200
i don't know i see it's slightly

00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:31.360
i'm plugged into like the weird

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.720
political matrix right now it's a

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.799
celebration of black royalty they're

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:37.120
they they're yeah it's it's about black

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.880
people being powerful all right so shut

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.320
up but i know what you mean

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.760
if that's don't have a problem that was

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.039
according though was like well that's

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:44.240
the point of the movie to make you feel

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.919
uncomfortable i'm like so good then get

00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:47.360
it out of your system i'll play a role

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.400
that you can

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.480
that's yeah i'll be hire me to yeah

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.080
white dude in your movie all right

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.080
whatever you guys say yeah yeah make me

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.039
look like an idiot just get it out

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:01.360
yeah i think you're exactly right as far

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.840
as uh like

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.600
trump winning and this is what i was

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.279
trying to get to until i got sidetracked

00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:09.200
with my

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.400
[ __ ] a good anti-obama

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.159
i remember saying uh like trump winning

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:16.000
was the worst thing imaginable for all

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.799
this [ __ ] that i already hated before he

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:21.200
got elected like i mean him winning was

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.000
funny for like a week yeah and then now

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.400
the left is just doubled down and

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.640
everyone's like they're exactly right

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.559
they are the correct ones and it's like

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:33.440
yeah now this whole wave of like get out

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.679
was the best thing i've ever seen black

00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:37.600
panther i [ __ ] jerked off in the

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.760
theater yeah i love the nba more than

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.840
anything not in my country matt well

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.559
dude

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:44.320
this is america this is what i this is

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.559
what i remember

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:48.320
i was full alex jones and i was like you

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.440
don't understand you're not the

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.080
crosshairs of this movement

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.080
but what your your alternate reality of

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.240
hillary winning the other the only thing

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.400
with that is that so if the protest

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.320
would have been basically like protests

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.600
launched by guys in like size 42 lees

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.600
are so easily wrong with that dude it's

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.440
so easy

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.039
yeah but think about if these were like

00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:10.559
guys in like hunting caps like dude

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:12.799
[ __ ] hell no crooked hillary

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.159
news would have been like and there

00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:16.400
those guys are back to the news

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.080
if it's all girls in the street you're

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:18.960
like

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.799
[ __ ] we can't just be like shut the [ __ ]

00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:22.880
up you got to be like

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.919
all right what are you guys talking

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:25.600
about all right that's nice if it was

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.760
white guys protesting there's no [ __ ]

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.120
more ignorance

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.960
aren't protesting but if they if you

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.080
were saying this

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.679
i was in alternate reality universe i

00:27:33.679 --> 00:27:35.520
understand we're like crooked hillary

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.919
and they do if you watch waco the white

00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:39.919
nationalists if you watch not waco but

00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:42.240
the documentary the netflix documentary

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.400
those dudes protest hard as [ __ ] that

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.240
was back when the right was the extreme

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.679
right was that like their pinnacle yeah

00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:50.080
that's but i remember that and we were

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.240
watching the waco [ __ ] last night and i

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.320
was talking to chris and i was like dude

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.279
if

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:56.880
and and i think they

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.279
need to but if will not need to but they

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.480
need to figure something out with

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.720
[ __ ] gun rights but if they decide to

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.120
start taking people's ar-15s there's

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.440
going to be about 40 [ __ ] wacos

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.240
it's gonna get nuts dude if

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.559
let's see whoever comes in after trump

00:28:12.559 --> 00:28:14.240
and if the pendulum swings just as hard

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.559
to the left if we get in some [ __ ]

00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:19.279
guy that's like or some chick god forbid

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:20.720
that's like

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.320
we need to get rid of everybody's

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.799
assault rifles dude you can't turn them

00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:26.559
holy [ __ ] they'll do this grandfather if

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:28.480
they do like a gun return and then

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.000
they're like and those of you who didn't

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.840
return them we're going to come get them

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.520
it's like they'll never do that it's

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.720
going to be crazy they'll they'll do

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.320
like no longer can buy them and if you

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.600
have an ar they'll just be like well

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.120
[ __ ] it yeah you gotta let them go

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.200
because if they try to take those things

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.279
dude there's there's no way there's no

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:44.880
way that would be radicalized i mean

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.880
that would like you'd have like 10 dan

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.799
bilzerians and joe rogans out in the

00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:50.320
[ __ ] woods

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.600
i mean dude you don't want those you

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.520
have like mutated rogans yeah it's not

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.960
even you you're going you're tapping

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.640
into a strain of [ __ ] white trash

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.240
freedom dude that's just like that

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.320
actually like has a decent point they're

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.440
like they're actually coming for our

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.520
cons like yeah it's weird oh it's weird

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.279
because they are fine they down like so

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:07.279
like the when i first started stand up

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:08.480
like the

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.399
like what was funny was dominated more

00:29:10.399 --> 00:29:11.600
by the right because like guys would

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.679
just go up on stage and be like [ __ ]

00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:16.080
lazy ass mexicans and people would just

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.520
crack up and i remember watching like

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.200
god this sucks and now i watch the

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.399
liberal version of that i'm like god

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:22.480
this [ __ ] sucks yeah it's just weird

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.159
because they like the wacos was like we

00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:26.320
were kind of operating on like somewhat

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.159
of that and now it's more just like the

00:29:28.159 --> 00:29:30.159
the left stuff and the left the left so

00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:31.520
i got capcom

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.279
and this is kind of a change of subject

00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:35.440
because i think we need to yeah but uh

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.679
the left stand up

00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:39.760
is so [ __ ] bad and that's the whole

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.600
world of stand-up right now

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.799
and

00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:45.440
because that's so mainstream

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.520
nobody notices it yeah you know what i

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.840
mean like people watch two dope queens

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.000
and are like this is comedy this is

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.080
normal comedy that's true that's like

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.720
that's not comedy that [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.760
sucks

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.200
at

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.480
if if you watch two dope queens on hbo

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.320
and you think that that's comedy you

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.919
should [ __ ] go hang yourself imagine

00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:08.320
if you're watching louis ck's special

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.520
and then in the middle of it he just

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.200
like interviewed

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.640
some dude he'd be like what the [ __ ]

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.080
he doing right now this isn't it you

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.679
can't interview somebody during and call

00:30:15.679 --> 00:30:17.760
it an hbo special you just

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.600
your podcast it's not a special they're

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.200

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.279
two dope queens has always been

00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:25.039
those two go on and then they bring out

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:26.159
people and do like a show so it's a

00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:28.159
podcast but they said it's this showcase

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:29.279

00:30:35.919 --> 00:30:39.520
season yeah but it's uh yeah whatever

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.520

and those people in our arkansas would

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.320
defend your statue

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.160

it like you got to research the

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.040
endocannabinoid system so i can't

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.480

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.760
know well whatever it is i think it

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.880

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.119
but it is pretty sick so gerby is here

00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:23.040
to talk about kind of to talk about you

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.440
have a loose outline of your upcoming

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.040
talk yes

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.839
um yeah yeah what's it about so the the

00:39:29.839 --> 00:39:33.359
um this talker show uh is going to be

00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:35.920
about human progress

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.280
how we make it

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.800
why it's a good thing and then what

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.240
would get in the way of it

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.720
and this is progress that's basically

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.520
like

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.880
western

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.359
progress since the enlightenment oh [ __ ]

00:39:47.359 --> 00:39:48.320
um

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.040
what's up just forgot how [ __ ] white

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.119
supremacists and all right this talk is

00:39:53.119 --> 00:39:55.599
very white surprised now that i really

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:56.960
it definitely is they left would

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.320
describe this is

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.200
true

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.320
and they're more than others and they're

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.480
impeding progress

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.560
that's why that book sapiens you read

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.000
that right yeah there's towards the

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.560
beginning he goes on this long

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.359
like

00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:10.960
i mean it had to have been i listened to

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.800
it on audible but it was like

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.440
a 20-minute section was just devoted to

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.800
like

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.040
like uh white supremacy is obviously bad

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.240
obviously this is obviously it was like

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.480
a very sjw slanted take and i was like

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.760
where the [ __ ] this book going then he

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.440
was like and here comes the rest like he

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.560
almost had to get that out of the way

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.680
because what he was about to say would

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.800
have been so

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.000
people would not be able to take it

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.440
unless he was like okay let me say all

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.359
the disclaimers okay now we can go back

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:34.240
with all the other [ __ ] yeah the

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.000
prologue has to be like

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.800
i'm not racist i'm not sexist yeah white

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.599
supremacy is bad here's why the western

00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:43.200
world is the best

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.720
basically that was the book yeah the

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.680
western world the western ideals are not

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.680
for white people right anybody can have

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.520
them and most people do in different

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.680
countries yeah they just mayor yeah so

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.599
they can't express them

00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:58.079
um but sapiens is an interesting example

00:40:58.079 --> 00:41:00.880
because the conclusion he draws about

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.240
human nature

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.640
or humans in general is kind of what i'm

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.319
pushing back on in this talk which is

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:08.000
that they're

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.160
we haven't accomplished anything he says

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.760
that like at the very end dude that

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.119
freaking the end of it freaks me out

00:41:13.119 --> 00:41:14.240
because it's like yeah everything you

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.760
believe is an absolute delusion and

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.119
you're just kind of deluding yourself

00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:18.480
and you have to get your delusions to

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.920
line up with the shared delusions of

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.760
society and i was like what a [ __ ]

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.440
[ __ ] dude yeah i didn't like that but

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.359
i was i'm too dumb to be like push back

00:41:25.359 --> 00:41:27.200
so i'm looking forward to your pushback

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.480
because i was like stewing in my car

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.560
like what a [ __ ] wait he's smuggling

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.240
his book by saying we haven't

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.480
accomplished anything

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.240
is that is that i still have like 20

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.760
minutes left but i've got he's building

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.280
up to the point where he's like it's all

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.960
just shared delusions and blah blah blah

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.480
blah so what's this

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.920
two there's two different things there

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.480
though one is that he thinks kind of

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.319
like what you're saying that everything

00:41:48.319 --> 00:41:50.079
that we think is just a story and we

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:51.680
have to buy into this story and that's

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.160
what allows us to function

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.319
yeah but the other thing is that humans

00:41:56.319 --> 00:41:58.640
really haven't made any progress it's

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.640
just that we think that we have

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.599
that

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:03.280
i mean i'm probably not doing a great

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.800
job no i can't i get what you're saying

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.920
that makes that makes sense because

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.000
that's uh he was like getting into the

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.599
factories like we haven't even touched

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:11.440
genetics yet like the stuff we're about

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.640
to do is about to blow everything out of

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.400
the water and i've wondered that too if

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.319
our stuff maybe isn't that tight throw

00:42:16.319 --> 00:42:18.240
everything out of the water dude it is

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.839
so funny i've wondered that too like if

00:42:19.839 --> 00:42:21.520
we were just like beef i'm sure a beaver

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.280
sits in its dam and it's like dude this

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.200
is [ __ ] sick i wonder if our stuff's

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.359
not as good as he thinks

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:28.960
i don't know but we've been to the moon

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.280
that's pretty cool it's like yeah i

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.280
think he's a relativist so he just says

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.040
like you think that that matters but

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.480
there's no way to gauge that that

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.240
actually matters well his weird thing

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.680
one thing he said it threw me off was

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.480
like

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.240
well if human beings were to perish from

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.079
the earth the universe would go on it's

00:42:44.079 --> 00:42:45.359
he's like absolutely absolutely

00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:47.280
meaningless and it's like okay that's a

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.520
weird step that makes no sense right and

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.920
we are anything but meaningless yeah and

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.599
and that this is like kind of

00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:55.119
one of the things of the talk and you

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:56.960
know you bring up jordan peterson i

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.079
think um not that i would agree with

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:02.480
everything but i i really like him yeah

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.319
obviously and one of the things i think

00:43:04.319 --> 00:43:05.839
he's doing that's very important is

00:43:05.839 --> 00:43:07.839
giving people a sense of purpose

00:43:07.839 --> 00:43:10.880
yeah um in his new book the 12 rules for

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.480
whatever you know yeah i'm almost i'm

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.920
halfway through that's 12 rules for

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.560
white supremacists

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.240
should he find some white supremacists

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.200
ah you know but um

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.280
okay so so let me just start with like

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.520
this general idea

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.680
that i think

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:28.960
what

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.200
a lot a lot of bad ideas come from this

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.359
belief that there would be some way to

00:43:33.359 --> 00:43:35.680
go back to living in harmony with nature

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.960
that like when you look at human

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.960
progress you could see these bad things

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.040
you can see like you know global warming

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.040
or factory farms or you know

00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:46.880
nuclear weapons and you go well we just

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.560
need to get back to it the symbiotic

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.720
relationship with nature yeah this kind

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.280
of like i eat the berry i poop the seed

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.040
the seed becomes a bush and it's just

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.599
like this one to one life and death and

00:43:57.599 --> 00:44:00.160
that it's just like total [ __ ] yeah

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:00.960
it

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.680
does not work that way whatsoever

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.920
um nature go ahead no no i was saying

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.400
what do you so how

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.319
so you think it's good that we conquered

00:44:12.319 --> 00:44:14.079
the native americans and expelled them

00:44:14.079 --> 00:44:15.680
from this land so we could create this

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.280
great empire no that's not the

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.440
conclusion

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.359
they're out in the woods eating [ __ ]

00:44:21.359 --> 00:44:24.319
berries [ __ ] in tents [ __ ] around

00:44:24.319 --> 00:44:25.680
we should show up and be like get the

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.440
[ __ ] out of here we're building nukes

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.640
well i think there's a difference

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.040
between saying we should find a way to

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.240
conquer or control nature yeah and

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.640
commit

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.960
would you say that the hoover dam is

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.240
greater than anything the native

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.000
americans ever accomplished just the

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.079
hoover dam specifics of the hoover dam

00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:48.000
would you say that

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.160
the st louis arch is a greater

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.319
accomplishment than any single thing

00:44:52.319 --> 00:44:55.359
those [ __ ] savages ever did well i

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:56.400
mean now that this is going to

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.319
unavoidably make me sound racist but the

00:44:58.319 --> 00:45:00.720
knowledge that's contained in the arch

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.960
namely things about them

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.760
so yes yes definitely a hundred percent

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:09.599
what uh yeah because

00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:11.440
you're putting this on native americans

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.880
so i would rather instead of like

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.200
putting this on a specific demographic

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.720
you want to put it on the whole earth i

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.560
just want to say that do we want

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.560
societies that create knowledge or don't

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.839
create knowledge

00:45:21.839 --> 00:45:23.839
and there you go

00:45:23.839 --> 00:45:25.440
that's fair you could suck air through

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.680
your teeth yeah that's fair dude the

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.520
sound of this dude i'm telling you this

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.359
is this is pure academics dude obviously

00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:33.119
i agree with everything you're saying

00:45:33.119 --> 00:45:35.440
but it's funny to put you in a point

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.280
where you have to be racist because if

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.040
you do break down this logic down to

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.359
individual groups it gets racist

00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:42.560
but you don't have to that's the thing

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.839
yeah you don't have to yeah it's funny

00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:44.960
that you can

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.240
you yeah you could do you want the

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.160
microscope zoomed out and you're making

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.000
this statement but i'm saying you know

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.400
increase that about ten times so we can

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.000
analyze an individual about native

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.839
americans is like let's

00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:57.920
it's there's nothing to prevent somebody

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.440
just from the geographic location in

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.880
which they were born from creating

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.480
knowledge it's just that there's certain

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.359
cultural ideas that get in the way of it

00:46:05.359 --> 00:46:06.640
yeah and

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.599
um

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:09.040
that was my favorite thing about sapiens

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.200
how they said how that's basically why

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.800
the europeans did so well because they

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.040
assumed there was stuff they didn't know

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.200
whereas like china china wasn't more

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.520
advanced than europe at the time but

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.720
they were like yeah the emperor's

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.880
talking to god we're all good here [ __ ]

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.800
off yes that was what happened and then

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.000
all of a sudden it's like hundreds of

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.040
years later they're like what are those

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.960
[ __ ] guys doing it was too late dude

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.599
europe was too was just out of control

00:46:31.599 --> 00:46:33.599
guns germs and steel you ever read that

00:46:33.599 --> 00:46:35.119
very similar to that it's basically like

00:46:35.119 --> 00:46:37.280
why europe conquered the world but i

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.160
wouldn't agree with necessarily his

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.480
his thesis in that book which he says

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.720
it's it's just the geographics so it's

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.800
like europe had more access to this type

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.480
of animal and therefore that made them

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.240
better when really it's like no it's the

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.200
ideas ah it's the white man's mind

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.720
it's not necessarily the white man's it

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.240
could be any man's mind but it just

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.000
happens to be the white man's

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.960
well it's russia is not really white

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.040
true

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.440
back up there yeah

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.920
because this this would be the main

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.119
purpose of the talk like you were

00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:12.160
bringing up about um other cultures that

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.839
have had their sort of what i would call

00:47:13.839 --> 00:47:16.480
a final answer yeah which that that to

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.960
me is if there's one filter through

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.960
which you could pass any ideology it

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.599
should be is this ideology

00:47:23.599 --> 00:47:26.240
you know purporting to know something

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.280
that is not challengeable so like

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.839
a final answer communism for instance

00:47:31.839 --> 00:47:33.119
claims to know the perfect way to

00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:34.960
organize this political and economic

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.359
institution so if you can't error

00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:39.839
correct it then when an

00:47:39.839 --> 00:47:43.599
inevitable problem arises you're [ __ ]

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:46.640
and then that is exactly what happened

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.359
and will always happen with communism

00:47:49.359 --> 00:47:50.960
because it's top down you don't allow

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.480
for error correction whatsoever you

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.599
claim to know the perfect way to

00:47:53.599 --> 00:47:57.440
organize it so but just to come back to

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.960
nature

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.720
we were talking about how

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.640
it's totally

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.000
impossible to live in harmony with

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.160
nature and one of the reasons is like if

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:06.880
you

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.880
if you were to personify nature trying

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.920
to do this kind of as a joke so

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.079
help me out but

00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:15.520
it would be a horrible negotiating

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.200
partner if you sat down you're like

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.640
nature i want to live in harmony with

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.560
you nature would be like i'm going to

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.319
kill a third of your kids before they

00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:24.480
reach adulthood nature let's for this

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.079
argument let's say nature's just a mean

00:48:26.079 --> 00:48:28.160
black lady

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.680
and you're like nature i want to work

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.920
with you and she's like dick no nature

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.880
is not a mean

00:48:35.359 --> 00:48:37.359
mother nature is definitely a black lady

00:48:37.359 --> 00:48:40.800
no she's like tsunami over here um

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.680
hurricanes for y'all

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.319
okay so that is true though so what is

00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:49.440
true all those things that this lady

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.880
would be saying is stuff that nature

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.240
would be saying

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.720
here's a flood here's a drought yeah and

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.119
it's it's more than nature just being

00:48:57.119 --> 00:48:59.040
like here's a disease here's all these

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.520
things it's also changing the arena in

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.520
which it's attempting

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:06.640
to kill you insofar as like 18 000 years

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.880
ago england during the last ice age was

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.880
under a mile of ice

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.680
it's like a mile to the sky of ice and

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.599
then 180 000 years before that it was

00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:17.839
just like a swamp with hippos in it

00:49:17.839 --> 00:49:19.200
it's like

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.440
this is with hippos yeah that's pretty

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.040
great that's a coin nature's like a

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.359
really really really hard level of mario

00:49:25.359 --> 00:49:27.680
basically

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.119
it's just like an impossible [ __ ]

00:49:29.119 --> 00:49:30.640
video game it's like it's like a

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.319
neighbor that you pissed off it's just

00:49:32.319 --> 00:49:34.079
like crazy i still kind of like mean

00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:35.920
black lady in this okay

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.160
uh-uh hippos

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:41.359
you get hippos now

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.200
all right mean that's not mean it's

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.280
funny it's nature being a mean black

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.540
lady just like

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:49.680
[Music]

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.319
typhoid

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.480
it's great

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.280
hear that how would that explain the

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.920
colonial expansion dude she's trying to

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.000
stop him no way meanwhile she's like

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.920
cortez spread that [ __ ] i mean black

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.400
lady mother nature well she's she's also

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.400
like you know she's mean black lady she

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.520
doesn't care about what do you think she

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.040
gives a [ __ ] about aztecs that's

00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:17.040
get them smallpox engage

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.040
all right sorry so

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.119
the point is is that

00:50:21.119 --> 00:50:22.480
we

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.559
now what nothing

00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:27.119
were you laughing

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.760
do you want to go with it no no we we

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.000
now have the ability to create knowledge

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.440
since the enlightenment we know how this

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.839
is done which is basically trial and

00:50:35.839 --> 00:50:37.920
error correction you know you come up

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.359
with ideas and you try and prove them

00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:41.200
wrong and the ideas you prove wrong you

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.720
get rid of and that's how you separate

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.480
true ideas from bad ones

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.480
okay but but that this is again the

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.920
problem of somebody claiming to know a

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.599
final answer where they'd say oh this

00:50:49.599 --> 00:50:51.920
this idea you can't say is wrong yeah

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.520
it's like it's like the um the muslim

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.960
thing we watched where the guy was

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.559
saying like why is it bad to have sex

00:50:56.559 --> 00:50:57.760
with your cousins and he's like it is

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.160
very negligible

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.599
the guy he was trying to say like it is

00:51:01.599 --> 00:51:03.680
a very small chance of having a bad baby

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.960
yeah that's that's what you get that's

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.160
how you end up [ __ ] your cousins and

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.359
being like nah that's totally cool

00:51:07.359 --> 00:51:08.880
that's what danny o'leary was over here

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.800
saying yeah he was talking about how

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.440
catholicism reads the bible or like

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.359
interprets the bible and is like

00:51:15.359 --> 00:51:17.280
we don't know everything and it's it's

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.960
evolving hopefully

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.400
whereas

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.920
protestantism or protestants and islam

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.440
where he like in the team were like the

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.040
book is final

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.200
the bible is yeah yeah this is verbatim

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.040
this is correct

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.119
while the catholics are like we can

00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:35.200
change this yeah like we don't need to

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.200
stick to this because problems

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.319
that's the point of your talk saying

00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:40.559
like that's what you need in order

00:51:40.559 --> 00:51:42.079
in order to make a biography

00:51:42.079 --> 00:51:44.960
yeah and and so many cultures throughout

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.920
history failed to do that and still many

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.160
cultures today fail to do that who did

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.680
so where did it start

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.000
when people start doing that well i

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
there's the greeks

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.079
well they tried to and then the spartans

00:51:58.079 --> 00:52:00.960
were like [ __ ] you yeah sorry it's over

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.280
your enlightenment's done

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.200
the spartans were all mean black ladies

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.440
there's i think a lot that would

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.400
like

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.240
what you're learning contribute to the

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.839
enlightenment i think in this book

00:52:11.839 --> 00:52:14.079
called why nations fail one of their

00:52:14.079 --> 00:52:16.640
ideas is that the plague which wiped out

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.640
half of you know i guess europe yeah uh

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.880
so if you're in england at the time and

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.400
all of a sudden you're you know working

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.839
on somebody's land and you're kind of

00:52:25.839 --> 00:52:28.559
beholden to that and then half of the

00:52:28.559 --> 00:52:32.480
workers die suddenly you've got power

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.319
because you're like hey if you need me

00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:35.760
you're gonna have to give me some rights

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.280
you're gonna have to give me something

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.319
to do

00:52:38.319 --> 00:52:40.079
really yeah you're saying diseases

00:52:40.079 --> 00:52:42.000
caused that well no i'm not i'm saying

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.800
that that's one facet oh i get what

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.240
you're saying because the labor pool

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.440
became scarce because all these people

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.559
died

00:52:48.559 --> 00:52:51.359
1350 around there yeah that's pretty

00:52:51.359 --> 00:52:52.640
cool you know it came from the middle

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.240
east

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.280
huh what the black death yeah dead

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.599
plague supposedly that's uh that's sick

00:52:59.599 --> 00:53:01.200
too to be like on your resume it's like

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.160
i survived to play you're like nice

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.480
[ __ ] good survive the plague

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.200
so um but coming back to so if we go

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.200
back to this ice you know this smile

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.079
it's like

00:53:12.079 --> 00:53:13.119
now that

00:53:13.119 --> 00:53:15.200
if we were to run into a scenario where

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.640
another ice age was happening upon us

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.680
yeah we would not let that happen

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:24.319
if ice were supposed to come you know

00:53:24.319 --> 00:53:25.839
they're gonna put up nature's gonna put

00:53:25.839 --> 00:53:27.119
a mile of ice on philadelphia you're

00:53:27.119 --> 00:53:29.359
like all right what would they do

00:53:29.359 --> 00:53:31.760
what what would they do well we would

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.599
geo-engineer the planet much like we're

00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:35.359
going to do on mars

00:53:35.359 --> 00:53:37.760
much like we'll do as we spread out

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:41.119
through the cosmos and oh yes we brought

00:53:41.119 --> 00:53:43.359
a crazy guy here why

00:53:43.359 --> 00:53:45.200
old crazy gurban you don't think we're

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.400
spreading out through the cause we're

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.680
not spreading out through the cops we

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.440
can already terraform mars yeah we have

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.520
we must dude no [ __ ] that dude i'm not

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.960
going anywhere i'm not leaving my

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.200
america i love america

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.680
let me just clarify one point here about

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:00.000
what's sounding very optimistic so this

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.640
comes from david deutsch uh the

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.280
physicist which is that

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.680
like what is possible and he says as

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.720
long anything that is not um that does

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.800
not violate the laws of physics is

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.640
possible given that we create the right

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.160
knowledge have you ever seen any [ __ ]

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.200
though

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.720
i'm pretty sure i violate the laws of

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.400
physics you definitely do dude i've

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.200
heard it

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.810
[Laughter]

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.720
no i've never

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.040
been face and timing he ate one girl's

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.200
[ __ ] so hard that i [ __ ] two rooms

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.880
over i can't i made you guys

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.319
my pants

00:54:44.319 --> 00:54:47.280
i was just standing there i was like

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.960
i'm sorry starting country it's like in

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.800
logan when uh professor x has those

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.559
seizures and everyone's just like

00:54:52.559 --> 00:54:54.559
i can't move that's what happens when

00:54:54.559 --> 00:54:57.760
maddie's supposed to see the whole room

00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.599
all right sorry sorry talking about

00:54:59.599 --> 00:55:01.440
space exploration

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.040
david so you can do anything as long as

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:05.200
it doesn't violate the laws of physics

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.960
given that we create the knowledge so

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.800
what it's saying it's not guarantee it's

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.640
not a form of optimism that guarantees

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.319
that we will spread out through the

00:55:12.319 --> 00:55:13.839
universe yeah it's just guarantees that

00:55:13.839 --> 00:55:14.880
we can

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.040
so that's up to us

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.440
and um

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.400
uh

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.640
see i i've lost my train of thought for

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.240
a second because i was well you were

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.240
talking about how any problem

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.800
we can we can fix right so something

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.800
like oh yeah the ice block sure so

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.480
something like global warming would be

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:35.760
the same thing and uh right now the

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:38.240
conversation seems to be dominated from

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.000
the right who's saying it doesn't exist

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.599
or the left who's saying we've got to go

00:55:41.599 --> 00:55:45.119
back to living in this way yeah that

00:55:45.119 --> 00:55:46.880
you know um

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:47.760
is

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.680
neither is right i mean at some point in

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.520
the future

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.280
problems from nature are inevitably

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.240
going to happen so the ice age natural

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.799
climate change or a volcano erupts or an

00:55:58.799 --> 00:56:01.359
asteroid or a meteor or taken to the

00:56:01.359 --> 00:56:03.520
extreme the sun's going to burn out

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:06.240
yeah and so the only thing that is going

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.680
to meet and neutralize those problems is

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.240
human knowledge that we can create so

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.799
that makes us incredibly important to

00:56:14.799 --> 00:56:17.599
the universe there you go yeah no that

00:56:17.599 --> 00:56:19.680
makes sense yeah it's [ __ ] sick we've

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.200
had this conversation a couple times i

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.040
really enjoy it oh good well it's also

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.680
talked about this at bards yes yeah can

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.520
i just say one please please

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.280
because i was to me it's kind of funny

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.480
too because

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.920
you can imagine

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.359
if even in 1900 if like an asteroid was

00:56:35.359 --> 00:56:38.079
coming to us a big one you'd be like i

00:56:38.079 --> 00:56:39.520
mean we'd have the telescopes to look at

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.680
we kitty hawk hadn't even happened yet

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.440
you know you're still

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.599
you know orbeez are on horses yeah what

00:56:45.599 --> 00:56:46.640
do you do

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.640
and now it's just like all right

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.720
we've got serious

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.880
weaponry to blast that thing in a little

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.359
piece later nature that's nature too by

00:56:55.359 --> 00:56:57.119
the way yeah yeah

00:56:57.119 --> 00:56:58.960
nature is the earth but it's like

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.559
asteroids are nature that's true too

00:57:00.559 --> 00:57:02.079
yeah no they're coming to [ __ ] get

00:57:02.079 --> 00:57:03.200
you dude

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.559
i'm actually i am glad they hit the

00:57:04.559 --> 00:57:06.240
dinosaurs

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:08.640
i'm glad i'm glad they hit the dinosaurs

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.480
that i saw the uh the new preview for

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.240
jurassic park yeah and i was like

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.839
watching those things i'm like what

00:57:13.839 --> 00:57:16.160
horrible [ __ ] creatures yeah

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.839
i saw a t-rex come up like they yeah

00:57:17.839 --> 00:57:19.520
they're just dumb and they're [ __ ]

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.200
eating every i was like this is horrible

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.640
dude yeah god created a bunch of they

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.920
can even [ __ ] apparently aren't they

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.079
bringing a willy mammoth back i don't

00:57:26.079 --> 00:57:27.599
know i hope so they're trying to they

00:57:27.599 --> 00:57:29.760
can take a uh i think like a calf and

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.200
put like a wooly mat or like an elephant

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.040
or something put it in its embryo that

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:33.839
that's what they're saying they're gonna

00:57:33.839 --> 00:57:35.760
bring in neanderthal back

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.280
so they can now they can take like

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.960
basically jurassic park yeah which is

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.799
funny because it's like it was an idea

00:57:40.799 --> 00:57:42.319
and it's like yeah i guess you could do

00:57:42.319 --> 00:57:43.599
that because

00:57:43.599 --> 00:57:46.400
there's a small movie

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.480
first of all

00:57:50.799 --> 00:57:52.240
they're so oppressed that they're a

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.559
synthetic

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.240
that was a very good joke steve uh made

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.480
fun of us we said we only do south park

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.400
impersonations no i said you

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.359
no

00:58:03.359 --> 00:58:05.520
okay

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.119
he was being mean to us earlier no it's

00:58:07.119 --> 00:58:08.400
being mean to you specifically i was

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.559
trying to wound you when i when i

00:58:10.559 --> 00:58:12.000
whenever you hurt me that's my

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.440
girlfriend's south park that's my

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.880
girlfriend's number one complaint is

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.319
whenever i impersonate her i'm she's

00:58:16.319 --> 00:58:17.520
like what did i even say i was like you

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.319
were like

00:58:18.319 --> 00:58:20.079
i do like cartman in person i don't know

00:58:20.079 --> 00:58:21.599
why i do it every time impersonating a

00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:23.359
girl it's like okay

00:58:23.359 --> 00:58:25.359
but uh the

00:58:25.359 --> 00:58:27.280
it's bringing back a woolly mammoth is

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.640
real dick move well they're trying to

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.720
bring back um neanderthals so we can

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.319
study them it's like hey what did you go

00:58:32.319 --> 00:58:34.799
extinct during the ice age well

00:58:34.799 --> 00:58:36.480
here's global warming

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.599
have fun

00:58:37.599 --> 00:58:39.839
yeah it's gonna be hot that thing's

00:58:39.839 --> 00:58:41.040
it's gonna be a negative experience

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:42.160
we'll definitely probably hook them up

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.400
with some like genetics cool down

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.319
jonestown and guyana you think so yeah

00:58:46.319 --> 00:58:48.240
let them out i'm all culted out dude

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:48.960
dude

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.559
i'm waiting to make neanderthals they're

00:58:50.559 --> 00:58:52.000
saying like that wasn't that wasn't

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.280
sapiens they're like maybe we'll bring

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.520
back neanderthals just to figure out

00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:56.640
like what the [ __ ] happened with him

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.000
well and that's another don't we owe it

00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.440
to him to resurrect the people that

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.359
we've exterminated that's what the guy

00:59:01.359 --> 00:59:02.880
was saying who is this this can't be

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.480
real you've all ferrari yeah he's

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.079
alright he's a very he's a staunch

00:59:06.079 --> 00:59:07.680
atheist yeah but they're never going to

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:10.160
do this but this was just him no it was

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.240
him like you know freely so he wasn't

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.520
saying like we should do this he was

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.119
like but why wouldn't we fear the

00:59:15.119 --> 00:59:16.480
technology and we you know we're

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.000
extincting all these birds and all this

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.599
stuff like [ __ ] it let's bring back

00:59:19.599 --> 00:59:21.200
neanderthals see what they're up to

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.040
again i just crazy

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.400
that's where he gets frustrated because

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.240
he has such a low opinion of of human

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.200
beings

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.599
yes we have caused animals to go extinct

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:32.119
so has nature yeah nature has killed

00:59:32.119 --> 00:59:33.680
99.9

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.400
of all living things this species excuse

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.319
me that's our odds of survival it's

00:59:38.319 --> 00:59:39.920
really low you know at one point seventy

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.359
thousand years ago we were down to like

00:59:41.359 --> 00:59:42.960
a few thousand of us

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:45.760
there was a volcano the toba eruption

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:47.680
and they say there was like 40 mating

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:50.960
pairs of humans left what but one final

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.820
thing is that why our cousins are so hot

00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.319
[Laughter]

00:59:54.319 --> 00:59:56.240
for sure that dude

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.920
just in case the volcano erupts dude you

00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.520
gotta start [ __ ] dude how sick of a

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.960
porn would that be it's just you and

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.720
your cousins the volcano he runs off and

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.400
you guys are like well we have to look

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.400
it's our duties we better start [ __ ]

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.119
that's crazy so there's 40 [ __ ] pairs

01:00:09.119 --> 01:00:12.160
and one final thing just to um

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.920
the low opinion of humans humans are the

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.960
only species that tries to undo the harm

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.200
that we do if you just let lions or if

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.720
you let t-rex just run they would just

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.240
eat everything yeah until there was

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.359
nothing left to eat and it was all done

01:00:23.359 --> 01:00:25.040
and died and that's it

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.559
and so interesting

01:00:26.559 --> 01:00:28.960
to my eye it's like if you think human

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.280
beings are bad for the planet which

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.240
you've all

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.079
does of course then it's just you run

01:00:34.079 --> 01:00:35.359
the following thought experiment it's

01:00:35.359 --> 01:00:37.920
like all right take human beings out and

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.920
then run the clock forward at some point

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.079
the sun burns out and every living thing

01:00:42.079 --> 01:00:43.119
dies

01:00:43.119 --> 01:00:46.079
suffers and dies if you put humans to it

01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:47.599
like yes we could create the knowledge

01:00:47.599 --> 01:00:50.079
to destroy ourselves or we could create

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:52.160
the knowledge to save everything whoa so

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.359
without humans certain death with humans

01:00:55.359 --> 01:00:56.960
maybe do some cool [ __ ] that's pro humor

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.079
that's a good that's a really good

01:00:58.079 --> 01:00:58.960
argument

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.319
because the clock's ticking dude and

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:01.760
it's this thing's gonna burn out but

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.040
what is that how many million years is

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.799
that five five billion dude we'll be so

01:01:04.799 --> 01:01:06.640
smart by that yeah yeah yeah but the sun

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.319
could kill us now

01:01:08.319 --> 01:01:10.799
it's like just if flared [ __ ] crazy

01:01:10.799 --> 01:01:12.160
yeah yeah yeah there's so much stuff

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.920
that can kill us now and that's why we

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.079
need to have as much knowledge created

01:01:16.079 --> 01:01:17.359
as possible i got to create some

01:01:17.359 --> 01:01:18.880
knowledge dude i haven't created [ __ ]

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.880
this podcast is helping that's true no

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.280
no doubt somebody some [ __ ] that

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.280
listens to this may give birth to the

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.240
sun

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.319
that creates the rocket ship that takes

01:01:28.319 --> 01:01:30.240
us to mars to

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.480
where are we all [ __ ] doing that bro

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.559
we [ __ ] our cousins on mars yeah i think

01:01:34.559 --> 01:01:35.920
we're going are we going tomorrow soon

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.160
yeah yeah

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.839
not [ __ ] sending up two dudes to [ __ ]

01:01:41.839 --> 01:01:43.200
on potatoes

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.200

just straight up just blowing [ __ ] up

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.559
i'm gonna start stockpiling ars

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.880
we were talking about that and i was we

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.119
were talking about how

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:22.720
we were talking about the waco thing and

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.799
i was like dude i can like i've

01:02:24.799 --> 01:02:26.160
literally

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.240
i've gotten like parking ticket i got my

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.000
my car repo by the parking authority and

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.240
i was literally like i i understand

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.400
terrorism like i really

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.240
would blow someone up

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.839
that was my i used to have a bit about

01:02:37.839 --> 01:02:39.440
it where it's like terrorism is only bad

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.119
if you're on the away team if you're on

01:02:41.119 --> 01:02:43.760
the home team it's like yes if you see

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.280
something you don't like blow up you're

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.640
like it's the best thing you can ever

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.680
see that's awesome it's the end of fight

club you're like awesome ending

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.599
you're just blowing up a city you're

like the best movie ever right yeah it's

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.680

i get why people get like i just paid

yesterday yeah [ __ ] them how about a

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.280

i'll give you all the uh and i'll

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.839
kill people and then i'll just be like i

01:03:31.839 --> 01:03:33.280
didn't do anything

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.640
celebrated

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.559
i would just blow that [ __ ] up all right

01:03:36.559 --> 01:03:38.799
so your talk

01:03:38.799 --> 01:03:40.720
is so you're a renowned white

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.440
supremacist yeah definitely and

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.760
just uh just one other thing like the

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.359
problem is that you're saying things in

01:03:47.359 --> 01:03:50.000
your alex jones voice

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.960
but some of them are are pretty close to

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.000
correct

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.240
which is hard to then agree with it but

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.240
you know i sent you a voicemail about

01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.680
this at one point

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.720
in

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.039
uh carl sagan and he has this beautiful

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:05.039
speech about the pale blue dot which is

01:04:05.039 --> 01:04:07.119
the voyager spacecraft

01:04:07.119 --> 01:04:09.599
is sent out and right before it's gonna

01:04:09.599 --> 01:04:11.440
i think it was like gonna pass neptune

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.280
he convinces nasa to turn it around and

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.359
take one last picture of earth and it's

01:04:15.359 --> 01:04:18.400
just this pale blue dot suspended in a

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.480
sun beam and that's how he describes it

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.960
and he writes eloquently it's it's

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.400
really beautiful

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.640
except this one part

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.160
where

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.240
again it's like

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:34.000
we draw we spill blood over arbitrary

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.760
lines in the sand it's kind of the

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.640
general idea and it's like yes the lines

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.520
are arbitrary but the ideas contained

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.880
within those lines are anything but

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.799
it's like it's not a mistake it's not

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:48.640
just random that there is an american

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.240
flag on the side of the voyager

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.240
spacecraft that took that picture that

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.880
wasn't like the wheel gots oh america

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.280
it's because these ideas that allow us

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.359
to create that type of technology yeah

01:04:59.359 --> 01:05:02.160
and that is worth dying for

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.240
that yeah you got me fired up [ __ ] man

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.079
i'm gonna go over there to isis so i'm

01:05:06.079 --> 01:05:07.359
gonna give them i'm gonna say we're

01:05:07.359 --> 01:05:09.200
trying to go to mars [ __ ] knock it

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.599
off that was the uh cut it out we're

01:05:11.599 --> 01:05:13.680
trying to get to mars they had a rule

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.839
before where they're like you can't use

01:05:15.839 --> 01:05:17.680
weapons in outer space because outer

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.280
space is like a serene peaceful

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.799
environment that was that's a funny

01:05:20.799 --> 01:05:22.480
thing like well but i can go to the

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.920
grocery store and just blow the [ __ ]

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.039
place out

01:05:25.039 --> 01:05:27.200
like why is space so [ __ ] sacrificing

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.920
this that was uh they was it bush or

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.680
someone during like the there was an act

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.599
now it was before that there was an act

01:05:33.599 --> 01:05:35.520
they passed it's a star wars act being

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.799
like we cannot have what we cannot

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.880
weaponize space space is like

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.240
celestial

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.240
we have to the weather exactly but it

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.839
was just funny for them to be like space

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:45.359
is too peaceful we can't believe it's

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:46.480
like dude why are you worried about the

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.640
peace in space it's the worst place ever

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.640
you know uninhabitable vacuum it's like

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.480
we can't [ __ ] around up there let's keep

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.720
[ __ ] our killings down to our nice

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.720
lush planet but no

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.160
back to what you said at the end there

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.760
though it's exactly right and that's

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.920
that is i mean everybody knows that

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.440
everybody knows that in their core i

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.720
think there's nothing wrong with it dude

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.760
it's like

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.000
i get survival of the fittest well

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.920
that's but it's but is that fair and the

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.760
best idea but it's that very method of

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.359
error correction that has

01:06:13.359 --> 01:06:16.079
allowed us to have the best human rights

01:06:16.079 --> 01:06:18.000
that we've ever had

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
it's the same thing it works the same

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
way as creating technology it's like

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.920
moral philosophy works the same way you

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.319
come up with theories and then you argue

01:06:26.319 --> 01:06:28.240
them well then well this goes i'm gonna

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.119
take it all the way back to black

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:31.280
panther dude and it's like

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.400
that's and i'm i'm spitballing but it's

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.920
like when you get a black dude who's

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.760
like you hate society and he's like [ __ ]

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.520
this [ __ ] that it sucks because it's

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.520
like western culture is sick it's like

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.799
you're going to space you're doing this

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:44.799
cool [ __ ] and then imagine if you wanted

01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:46.240
to join that but you felt like you were

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.160
betraying this weird inner sense of

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.599
yourself where it's like like when

01:06:49.599 --> 01:06:50.720
they're like you're white you're acting

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.480
white and it's like i just want to

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.319
[ __ ] go to space and stuff you know

01:06:54.319 --> 01:06:55.680
what i mean yeah it's like if you want

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.119
to go better yourself there's this weird

01:06:57.119 --> 01:06:58.720
internal thing where like am i selling

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.240
out and being white and it's like you

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.760
shouldn't have said betters that's well

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.960
i'm telling you that's the truth if you

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.559
want to like go to like mit and you have

01:07:04.559 --> 01:07:06.319
people being like

01:07:06.319 --> 01:07:08.559
you [ __ ] sell out uncle tom well and

01:07:08.559 --> 01:07:10.319
it's a shame because that's the weird

01:07:10.319 --> 01:07:12.000
pinwheel where it's like

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.520
you can't like you're saying to be like

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.200
dude i think pictures

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.319
what's up i think they're chilling on

01:07:16.319 --> 01:07:19.920
that definitely under grass tyson

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.359
definitely but it's one of those things

01:07:21.359 --> 01:07:22.880
where it's like and to say like you're

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.200
saying to even say like taking a picture

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.319
or being like yeah but that was the

01:07:26.319 --> 01:07:28.079
american flag on that it's like uh you

01:07:28.079 --> 01:07:29.920
think it's like

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.319
it was though and it's [ __ ] awesome

01:07:32.319 --> 01:07:33.839
so just [ __ ]

01:07:33.839 --> 01:07:35.839
squad up dude and i did join the [ __ ]

01:07:35.839 --> 01:07:38.160
team when i said survival of the fittest

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:41.039
i meant the fittest idea yeah yeah

01:07:41.039 --> 01:07:43.119
and it is the western i remember i

01:07:43.119 --> 01:07:45.039
remember i was in some [ __ ] sociology

01:07:45.039 --> 01:07:47.520
class and i said that like we were

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.680
talking about these these

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:50.799
uh

01:07:50.799 --> 01:07:53.440
muslim areas that treated women horribly

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.160
and i was like well this is wrong i

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.839
remember being like wait why are we

01:07:57.839 --> 01:07:59.920
supposed to respect this yeah

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.520
and she and like the lady was honestly

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.960
like well this is their culture this is

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.000
all right like

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.480
just a weird excuse for it yeah and i

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.640
remember just sitting there being like

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.319
i knew that that was the dumbest [ __ ]

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:12.160
i'd ever heard but it was you know yeah

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.599
that is bizarre and this is one that

01:08:13.599 --> 01:08:14.880
makes me sound like one of those stories

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.159
where it's like and then one student

01:08:16.159 --> 01:08:17.440
stood up

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:19.920
it was like professor i don't know if i

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.719
believe in god but i mean there's no way

01:08:22.719 --> 01:08:24.159
there's no way any listener of his

01:08:24.159 --> 01:08:25.759
podcast would not believe that you're

01:08:25.759 --> 01:08:26.880
sitting there in college and being like

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.719
well that sounds [ __ ] dumb

01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:31.199
yeah well i did that a lot but like i

01:08:31.199 --> 01:08:33.600
hated professors they were so [ __ ]

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.759
corny for the most part no i guess and

01:08:35.759 --> 01:08:38.000
like this it was a sociology class where

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.839
it was just like

01:08:39.839 --> 01:08:42.719
i mean i guess her point was just like

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:44.799
every cult like nothing matters is kind

01:08:44.799 --> 01:08:46.239
of what it all comes down to it's like

01:08:46.239 --> 01:08:47.679
that's what they believe in

01:08:47.679 --> 01:08:49.199
yeah you have to respect their culture

01:08:49.199 --> 01:08:50.239
would you hear they're doing anything

01:08:50.239 --> 01:08:51.359
well [ __ ] that you know they're doing

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:52.719
england now they're telling people to do

01:08:52.719 --> 01:08:53.839
from like people who come from like

01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:55.600
pakistan and are living in england if

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.679
you're going if you're getting like

01:08:57.679 --> 01:08:59.839
flown back to your like original country

01:08:59.839 --> 01:09:01.040
or like where your parents are from to

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.319
get like an arranged marriage they say

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.319
put a spoon down your pants so the metal

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:06.080
detector goes off do you see that on

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.520
reddit yeah yeah so the metal detector

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.719
goes off and you take it aside and

01:09:08.719 --> 01:09:10.319
you're like dude please don't make me

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:12.239
marry my cousin dude please

01:09:12.239 --> 01:09:14.480
well to your point shane too um there's

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.359
a

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.279
this guy fritz that i'm becoming friends

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:20.640
with that i like nice

01:09:29.839 --> 01:09:31.359
yeah what kind of friends well we're

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:33.040
just like talking on the phone

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.000
whoa i met him at the delco thing

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
yeah that's awesome slow down yeah i'm

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.279
supposed to go rock climbing with this

01:09:39.279 --> 01:09:42.080
russian guy i'm kind of nervous

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.759
wait you guys are just going on dates i

01:09:43.759 --> 01:09:45.440
got invited to go rock climbing by this

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.040
dude

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.880
and you are spending your nights on the

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.560
phone with some guy named fritz you're

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.080
out rock climbing i haven't we haven't

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.759
gone out we haven't go we haven't gone

01:09:53.759 --> 01:09:56.880
yet i'm not the only stranger

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.000
friends has a really good thought

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.320
experience about the situation that your

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.640
teacher proposed so you can imagine

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.159
somebody says

01:10:04.159 --> 01:10:07.040
i think it's wrong for the saudis to

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.199
force women to wear the burqa and they

01:10:09.199 --> 01:10:10.960
could turn around and say well listen

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.560
you think it's wrong for us to have laws

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.480
compelling what women can wear you have

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.480
laws compelling what women can wear in

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.280
the west you can't walk around topless

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.800
that's a law these are just social

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.000
differences these are cultural

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.480
differences who by by what standard are

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.480
you allowed to claim that you're better

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:29.600
and the the answer to that is

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.560
that if we as a society determine that

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.560
our laws about what women can or cannot

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.760
wear are wrong we can error correct them

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:40.239
and they cannot and that is why these

01:10:40.239 --> 01:10:41.920
cultures are just not

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.920
similar and that is why we can judge

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.760
theirs as wrong because the moment you

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.000
stop allowing error correction you stop

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.600
the growth of knowledge and knowledge is

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:52.239
how we solve problems and suffering and

01:10:52.239 --> 01:10:53.600
from that you just walk to the

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.400
conclusion that so muslims are wrong

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.360
well

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.320
it depends on what their particular

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.880
belief system would be if if you had to

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.040
depends on how hard you must yeah yeah

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.840
you only must so hard you must 100

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.560
i know the i understand

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.800
i understand

01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:23.440
[Laughter]

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.679
so you can only muzzle so hard dude if

01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:27.520
you muzzle out too hard you can't lost

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.120
your hand then steve german's gonna be

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:29.920
like

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.679
wrong

01:11:31.679 --> 01:11:32.880
sorry

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.840
you're wrong

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.360
i wonder though if that's a constant so

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.960
if you don't allow for error correction

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.280
would you say that

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.440
entropy is inevitable it's just going to

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.520
break apart

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.040
i don't know enough about i'm just

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.040
reading about entropy in stephen

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.080
pinker's

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.719
i think entropy is just like

01:11:50.719 --> 01:11:52.320
unstability or just like a building

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.000
which is a crumbling basically yeah

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.520
entropy would be

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.679
um it's the second law of thermodynamics

01:11:57.679 --> 01:11:59.520
so it says that things move from order

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.840
to disorder and it's much harder to put

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.000
something in order than it is to there'd

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.920
be many different versions of this

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.159
broken my life

01:12:08.159 --> 01:12:10.080
is a full entropy for real though it's

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.840
so hard to [ __ ] organize it you're

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.719
super interested i'm [ __ ]

01:12:14.719 --> 01:12:17.280
just a pile of rocks spread out somebody

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.640
needs to put this together and build a

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.040
castle build a great palace that's the

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.800
big petersburg not a titan hall is that

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.040
you're on like a dead system of culture

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.320
and you're supposed to revivify it and

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.840
then you become old and die and your

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.880
sons and daughters are supposed to

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.640
revivify it and like okay if you just

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.040
leave it be it just crumbles yeah i mean

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.360
if we just leave it be i i i guess

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.960
that's right i haven't really thought

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.040
that through i'm to my i just learned

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.960
about entropy when i was reading uh

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.159
the blade runner book and it said

01:12:42.159 --> 01:12:43.679
entropic and i'm like that's a cool word

01:12:43.679 --> 01:12:45.120
i looked it up and i was like crumbling

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.960
sick i understand

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.960
well i think like the the idea is that

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.480
the moment you stop solving problems

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.000
then you're just at the whim of nature

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.239
to kill you so the another example would

01:12:54.239 --> 01:12:55.760
be the easter islanders they're the ones

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.400
who built those big-ass [ __ ] heads

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.600
daryl charles statues

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.239
big ass [ __ ] heads they it's exactly

01:13:04.239 --> 01:13:06.640
right so

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.280
so the uh

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.480
the these these big ass daryl charles uh

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.679
statues

01:13:13.679 --> 01:13:14.800
that um

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.719
there's disagreement as to like what

01:13:16.719 --> 01:13:18.800
caused that the population to die off

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.320
whether it was deforestation well they

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.760
spent too much time building statues

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.080
exactly

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.159
while they while they were dying out

01:13:26.159 --> 01:13:27.520
they kept building

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.199
more and more at a faster and faster

01:13:29.199 --> 01:13:30.880
clip yeah so they didn't have the

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.560
knowledge to save their lives or do they

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.320
have the angry white dudes there to

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.400
protect their statues for them dude you

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:37.360
probably need it that's probably how

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.560
they stood the sands of time there's

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.480
probably guys like no don't push this

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.320
one this is a good statue

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.760
this is important aren't those statues

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:46.320
like impossible to have made like those

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.080
well isn't it like no no i'm not saying

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.760
like aliens but i'm saying like they

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.760
must have literally devoted everything

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.239
yes like the holes the foundations of

01:13:54.239 --> 01:13:56.719
those things are insane yep and like

01:13:56.719 --> 01:13:59.040
yeah that was their explanation for okay

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.880
things are going wrong well we need to

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.760
appease our ancestors more so it's like

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.800
let's make more of these things

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.159
building one of those things and being

01:14:08.159 --> 01:14:10.080
like all right yeah and then like just

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.520
pours on you for a month and you're like

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.440
what the [ __ ] man it's like build

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.400
another doing everything right yeah

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.000
god damn it i keep building [ __ ]

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.880
statues and shit's still [ __ ] up

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:24.320
my [ __ ] wife cheated on me

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.480
dude

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.000
that's so [ __ ] funny to do that and

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.920
just be like what the [ __ ] dude what do

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.600
we got to do that's what yeah i mean

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.640
it's

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.400
the rick and morty episode was great you

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.239
see that one where they uh

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:38.080
the big heads come out of the sky and

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:38.960
they're like

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.719
show me what you got yeah the blizzard

01:14:40.719 --> 01:14:43.600
yeah dude that was so [ __ ] funny

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.040
but it's like that yeah we've been doing

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:45.840
that

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.920
in this corny but basically the same

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.159
thing every single human ever has done

01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:51.679
which is build those statues and hope

01:14:51.679 --> 01:14:53.440
something changes like what you know

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.800
what i mean but

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.400
consistently i mean statues is a

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.400
metaphor yeah yeah we're all doing that

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.480
just doing [ __ ] building our own

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.320
yeah i seriously i hear your scenes yeah

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.000
my easter island statue is i go to a

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.400
comedy club and i get blacked out

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.000
and then i wake up the next day like

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.840
damn nothing's changing yeah that's

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.199
absolutely true i was like what do i

01:15:11.199 --> 01:15:13.280
have to do what am i doing wrong i like

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.320
think about that every now and again

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.080
then i'm like well i do kind of lay in

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.840
my bed for the first hour and a half of

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.719
my day and it's like scroll read it like

01:15:20.719 --> 01:15:22.080
reddit was the worst thing that happened

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.320
to you i know

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.600
so much better than facebook i'll give

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.640
it that oh at least instead of like

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.719
the like all caps opinions of dental

01:15:30.719 --> 01:15:32.880
hygienists at least i'm getting like

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:33.600
cool

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.600
pictures of cats and dogs so let me tell

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.440
you what happened about my kid and it's

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:40.159
like oh my god no but uh

01:15:40.159 --> 01:15:41.520
that is true that's an app metaphor and

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.360
you shouldn't [ __ ] downplay yourself

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.679
before you drop that well it's hot

01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:47.360
oh thanks i don't know this is [ __ ]

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.080
gay

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.000
here's a sick thought i thought i got to

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.239
downplay myself every time i speak

01:15:52.239 --> 01:15:54.480
yeah i don't have that confidence steven

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.960
well what why is america number one dude

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.120
i thought we covered that

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.360
i just want to hear it again

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.800
also too because one thing i think is

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:06.000
kind of funny but i can't i'm like

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.159
failing to make it funny it's just this

01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:09.199
idea

01:16:09.199 --> 01:16:10.560
of

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.840
explanations which i'm going to talk

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.120
about in the talk and this is in part

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.159
one but

01:16:14.159 --> 01:16:15.280
how

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.520
all cultures have had rain dances

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.040
oh yeah yeah this is great and i just

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.640
think it's interesting because first of

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.320
all a rain dance is an explicit attempt

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.400
at weather modification so like no

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.920
matter what you want to say about people

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:28.719
in the west you're like you're

01:16:28.719 --> 01:16:30.000
destroying the weather it's like that's

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.600
what they were trying to do

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.600
it's just that they failed at it

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.440
so that we're we're kind of like oh you

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.199
know like we look at it with a degree of

01:16:37.199 --> 01:16:39.600
reference if they're blasting lasers we

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.920
wouldn't be like oh right or if their

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.120
rain dances worked true i mean

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.640
what i was saying to shane was like if

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:47.920
you've lived with somebody that likes

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.840
the thermostat slightly different you

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.760
know how annoying that gets yeah if you

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.280
obviously you go out in the morning and

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.719
it's raining and you're like [ __ ]

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.920
[ __ ] savages like doing it again oh

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.480
my god goddamn redskins that's so

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.560
[ __ ] funny

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:06.560
god that's hilarious yeah the rain dance

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.560
to think of it as attempted weather

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.920
modification

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.360
i mean it is i don't even know of course

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.280
that's what it is it's funny to look at

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.360
it in that light and again though but

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.679
people look at chemtrails dude

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:19.360
it was native american chemtrails yeah

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.880
they're smoke signals they were [ __ ]

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.520
dancing they wanted to make the progress

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.239
that we make they just didn't know how

01:17:26.239 --> 01:17:28.480
fair enough and they didn't [ __ ] get

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.960
jiggy with it enough dude true i should

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.440
have danced harder damn the times that

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.679
it must have appeared to have worked

01:17:35.679 --> 01:17:37.679
yes i know it must have been the most

01:17:37.679 --> 01:17:39.920
lit [ __ ] dude

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.440
same thing as like an open mic when like

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.960
you're out your rain dance didn't work

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.400
some guy like drizzled a little bit he's

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.840
like dude you just gotta loosen up just

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.440
[ __ ] just gotta

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.360
be yourself dude

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.920
you're funny that was good it's like

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.440
you got a little human dude it's got

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.360
humid out there you just gotta [ __ ]

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.800
let him have it i've been doing this for

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.320
like 15 years bro it's like i know what

01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.280
i'm doing

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.480
that was people who thought they were

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.080
the [ __ ] at rain dancing must have been

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.159
so funny they must have like hit it once

01:18:04.159 --> 01:18:05.600
or twice and then just been like i'm not

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.280
doing it again

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.320
i can't do it like every 10 years

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.679
they'd hit one

01:18:11.679 --> 01:18:13.440
dude if you hit a rain dance you'd be

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.840
the [ __ ] man it's over dude it's over

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:16.719
well that's

01:18:16.719 --> 01:18:17.840
there was another book talking about

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:19.360
that and how like god evolved where

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.199
there'd be like people who would do that

01:18:21.199 --> 01:18:22.480
and then they'd be like yup this guy's

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.760
in charge of everything and then he'd do

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.280
it again it didn't work and he'd be like

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.480
which one of you guys did something

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.320
[ __ ] up and they're all like oh [ __ ]

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.320
yeah oh i did something [ __ ] up ah he

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.679
knows

01:18:31.679 --> 01:18:33.440
it's like an apocalypto when there's the

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.560
eclipse

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.480
do you see apocalypto no i want to see

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.159

they played like a trap beat

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.239
and then had migos describe the teams

01:20:56.239 --> 01:20:57.840
for like the commercials yeah they'd be

01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.719
like

01:20:58.719 --> 01:21:00.320
philly and like it would be philly

that's hilarious yeah anyway back to uh

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.520
indians dancing well

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.880
the one other comment i want to make

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:23.520
because when you were bringing up

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.280
how in the movie like you were saying

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.719
something about being in the morning you

01:21:26.719 --> 01:21:28.159
feel like i've been laying here for an

01:21:28.159 --> 01:21:31.520
hour yeah yeah i think that this

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.560
people

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.480
understandably and now i'm talking more

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.960
macro but people want change if they see

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.480
an injustice of some kind they want it

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.239
to change instantly and the moment it

01:21:40.239 --> 01:21:42.080
doesn't i think what we're seeing a lot

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.600
nowadays is that they go well the whole

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:47.120
thing is [ __ ] yeah and that to me is

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.719
just wrong it's like

01:21:48.719 --> 01:21:50.960
it doesn't happen quick but there is a

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:53.520
way to error correct the system clearly

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.920
clearly it's better now than it was yeah

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.360
didn't people not like come up with

01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.920
anything like before the last 500 years

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.280
like if you went back if you lived in

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.639
like

01:22:02.639 --> 01:22:05.280
uh what would it be i guess like

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.560
1100

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.239
if you live back in like 100 there

01:22:08.239 --> 01:22:09.920
wasn't that much of a difference right

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.600
that's right and then it was like 1500

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.760
now you're just like dude [ __ ] like

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.440
well science got invented 10 yeah

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.520
exactly but like dude 10 years ago if i

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.199
think about 10 years ago i was like it

01:22:19.199 --> 01:22:20.960
was so [ __ ] weird back then how

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.560
different it was yeah but like yeah

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:23.600
that's when people were just like well

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:25.360
let's just fix this incredibly complex

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:26.960
social problem now

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.880
it's like uh yeah it doesn't really work

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.440
that way it sucks it takes a while and

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.159
yeah

01:22:32.159 --> 01:22:33.440
that's last time i was always talking

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.719
about frank comedy which i won't get

01:22:34.719 --> 01:22:36.560

rights um he started gay rights like

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.360
eight years before stonewall and then it

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.920
by the time he died it's like

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.760
there had been massive progress but it

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:48.000
took an entire lifetime yeah yeah and

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.080
for the listeners stonewall was a gay

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.679
bar and then a bunch of cops broke in

01:22:51.679 --> 01:22:53.199

[ __ ] crazy what he does over there

01:28:51.199 --> 01:28:53.679
yeah he's it seems like he's just

01:28:53.679 --> 01:28:55.440
inducing chaos

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:56.639
just being like i'm the only one that

01:28:56.639 --> 01:28:59.040

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.520

everything's just kind of like i you can

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.800
watch the major news i don't think they

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:09.760
did that

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.120
i think it was all us that's what i'm

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.480

people in russia like everyone knew it

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.239

01:29:26.239 --> 01:29:27.440
and everyone they said there's a period

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:28.560
where they're all just kind of all just

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.000

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.080
happens every time it's crazy anytime

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.920
there's something like that like germany

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:37.760
nazi germany all that and it's about to

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:38.719
go down

01:29:38.719 --> 01:29:40.000
it's happening right now in north korea

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.480
guaranteed oh there's

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.719
there's just an all-knowing silence

01:29:44.719 --> 01:29:45.920
where they're all just sitting around

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.520
just like

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.400
whoa

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.840
like what the [ __ ] happening this

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:51.520
doesn't seem right you got it you have

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:53.040
to anyway but

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.639
i don't think russia like their

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:56.719
propaganda sucks

01:29:56.719 --> 01:29:58.800
it's so [ __ ] dude think how good ours

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.400
is what is ours

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.159
black octocola

01:30:02.159 --> 01:30:04.000
[ __ ] mcdonald's that was i mean

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.960
coca-cola that's [ __ ]

01:30:08.239 --> 01:30:09.840
no propaganda i'm saying yeah that is

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:12.320
propaganda rock music yes what you want

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:13.440
welcome to the job

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.360
probably every literally anything is

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.360
propaganda

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.120
well literally what do you think about

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.520
that i don't know i mean propaganda to

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.920
me is like a message or like you're like

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:25.520
i guess black hawk down that could be

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:26.800
considered proper like when those war

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.639
movies pop up right when we go into

01:30:28.639 --> 01:30:29.840
conflict in the middle east and black

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.840
panther was propaganda

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.679
everything's propaganda

01:30:33.679 --> 01:30:36.880
200 but yeah i know i i i could agree

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.960
that our propaganda is so [ __ ]

01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:40.880
mainstream that we don't even like i

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:42.480
mean that's amazing we've defined the

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.639
entire culture for the entire world

01:30:44.639 --> 01:30:47.360
true it's like it's so [ __ ] good and

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.080
it's like their propaganda is just like

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.520
think about it that's their commercial

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:53.120
that [ __ ] gay dude commercial that's

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:55.520
it that's crazy that's wild yeah no

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.440
that's what that is that sucks

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:00.239
but is he a meta propagandist to where

01:31:00.239 --> 01:31:02.960
like he made it so ridiculous on purpose

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.600
just to freak everyone out and that's us

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.679
that's like trump logic of like he's

01:31:07.679 --> 01:31:10.159
such a good he's a genie he's such a

01:31:10.159 --> 01:31:12.000
genius he knows it's like no dude this

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.480
is a [ __ ] this is a psycho this is a

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:15.840
crazy guy

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.400
yeah yeah apparently too he does a thing

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.159
called lateral warfare where he'll just

01:31:20.159 --> 01:31:21.920
like go in and bomb a country and

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.360
everyone's like why did he just do that

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.199
and they claim he just bombs countries

01:31:25.199 --> 01:31:27.199
to keep people unsure of what he's up to

01:31:27.199 --> 01:31:28.320
yeah probably because he's that's

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:29.940
[ __ ] he's not

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:34.140
[Laughter]

01:31:34.639 --> 01:31:36.480
i'm sure he's pretty [ __ ]

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.840
smart

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:39.679
if he was that smart but yes you don't

01:31:39.679 --> 01:31:41.600
know the citizenry of russia like how

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.199
many people did that fire out be like

01:31:43.199 --> 01:31:45.440
i'm not taking in a gay man i think how

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.760
stupid our people are yeah look at what

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:50.080
black panther's doing yeah

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:52.800
yeah this is it for us we're so powerful

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.679
now

01:31:53.679 --> 01:31:55.440
yeah dude well our situation is

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.560
different than russia because we have

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.239
like like russia doesn't have a lot of

01:31:58.239 --> 01:32:00.320
diversity do they yeah they do what is

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:02.719
it like they got [ __ ] asians they got

01:32:02.719 --> 01:32:04.159
i mean they have to come like they

01:32:04.159 --> 01:32:07.040
border mongolia in china and korea like

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:08.239
[ __ ] like that i wonder if they have

01:32:08.239 --> 01:32:10.000
like racial disputes they never really

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.159
they don't

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:18.080
genocides well they like invaded ukraine

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.520
right they're like they took that back

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.600
crimean peninsula like yeah this shit's

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:23.600
ours yeah they're nuts

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:26.159
true true that true that but it's not

01:32:26.159 --> 01:32:27.920
like [ __ ] finland i'm just trying to

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.920
paint it as well people are like in

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:31.760
america

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.360
we would be susceptible to a commercial

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.679
on that level oh yeah we're getting

01:32:35.679 --> 01:32:37.360
those commercials on that level except

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.120
in the other way yeah the super left

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.400
version of like

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.400
you believe all men and women should

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.480
marry each other yeah they love like the

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:46.080
super bowl commercials where you saved

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.679
the cancer patient because you bought a

01:32:47.679 --> 01:32:49.600
[ __ ] hyundai we're getting the exact

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.159
same propaganda oh it's bad dude it's

01:32:52.159 --> 01:32:53.920
not good steve girvin what do you think

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:55.520
i i don't really have uh too much of an

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.280
opinion yeah it doesn't matter yeah it

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.040
doesn't matter [ __ ] [ __ ] it's not it's

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.480
not good

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.560
that's why yeah it's not it's just

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:03.679
interesting

01:33:03.679 --> 01:33:05.679
i think russia's uh

01:33:05.679 --> 01:33:07.440
cruising for a bruising if you know what

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.840
i'm saying i read an article in new york

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.840
magazine but this is like two two years

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:15.199
ago but this reporter went over to

01:33:15.199 --> 01:33:17.600
investigate the fake news

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:18.800
hubs

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.199
and they set him up with a meeting with

01:33:21.199 --> 01:33:23.760
this woman and he writes about how like

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:24.960
he's meeting with her and then there's

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.719
this other guy there

01:33:26.719 --> 01:33:28.320
and the guy's acting weird and she's

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.760
acting weird and then when he came back

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:32.000
to the states that was all a setup for

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.239
this photo shoot that they did that guy

01:33:34.239 --> 01:33:36.400
was like a known white supremacist in

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:37.360
russia

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.679
and so then they put out this big story

01:33:39.679 --> 01:33:42.560
you know american journalists meets with

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.000
known one

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.920
it was just like one of those things and

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.760
i think it's so [ __ ] funny

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.620
interesting things in that it's like

01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:54.610
[Laughter]

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:56.639
no

01:33:56.639 --> 01:33:57.840
i'm not no

01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.280
i'm a journalist

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:02.320
that's such a sick move he's a funny god

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.000
the real takeaway too is that only like

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.560
40 of the russian population has access

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:09.520
to the internet and what putin's goal is

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.040
is kind of to what you were saying which

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.960
is to make it

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:15.520
so fake and so hard to figure out what's

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.760
real that you don't even go to it

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:19.360
so you can't even use it oh so the

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.880
internet if you try to go up it's just

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:22.239
like this

01:34:22.239 --> 01:34:23.679
people have tried it

01:34:23.679 --> 01:34:25.199
every second of their chat roulette is

01:34:25.199 --> 01:34:27.040
just every window it's putin jerking off

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.880
just like yeah and you're like oh jesus

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.199
christ chat roulette

01:34:31.199 --> 01:34:34.000

01:34:36.159 --> 01:34:38.080
live stream us on chat roulette that'd

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.520
be tight dude pretty funny she's

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.920
watching dudes jerk off

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:44.239
whoa hey look at that dick that would be

01:34:44.239 --> 01:34:46.639
awesome that's a great idea um you gotta

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:48.719

01:34:48.719 --> 01:34:50.639

01:34:50.639 --> 01:34:51.840
see the you wanna see this i was

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:54.000
thinking of just dual gopros like this

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.280
and then just

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:57.440
seeing the [ __ ] flames dancing off

01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.840
our face

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:08.159
the basement some candles i would

01:35:08.159 --> 01:35:10.400
contain my camera would be like a super

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.920
lit i'd have a box over me that's like

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:16.480
super lit up why just be tight contrast

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:20.159
my light would leak out of my little eye

01:35:20.239 --> 01:35:23.840
i'm working out here in the darkness

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.920
dude the machete every time i have a

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:28.639
machete reminds me of uh

01:35:28.639 --> 01:35:30.880
sean taylor the way he died did i tell

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:32.320
you this what happened he was the safety

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:34.480
for the redskins and he played for miami

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.400
and he was he was really [ __ ] good

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:37.440
like he's

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:42.600
unbelievably good but uh when he died

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:46.080
2007. okay i thought for some reason i

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.159
thought he was a recent reason

01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:50.400
i remember him i don't know he was

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.719
really good but anyway he uh

01:35:52.719 --> 01:35:54.960
he got murdered these kids broke into

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:57.120
his house they were trying to rob him

01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:59.199
and they shot him and he bled out

01:35:59.199 --> 01:36:00.560
but

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:03.280
i'm pretty sure when they broke in he

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:05.120
grabbed a machete

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.199
and was trying to attack them

01:36:07.199 --> 01:36:09.679
and the idea in my mind i've created

01:36:09.679 --> 01:36:10.800
just

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.520
naked shawn taylor with a machete in a

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.600
pitch black mansion

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:16.960
like all of a sudden i'm cheering for

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:18.880
the robbers yeah it's like a horror

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:19.760
movie

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:21.920
yeah like he's horrible dreadlocked

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.480
[ __ ] he was one of the most he's such

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:26.880
a good athlete he was like huge yeah

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.639
and he had a machete

01:36:28.639 --> 01:36:30.239
and you know how [ __ ] scary that

01:36:30.239 --> 01:36:32.159
would be if that guy was like

01:36:32.159 --> 01:36:33.679
screaming scary enough parts of the

01:36:33.679 --> 01:36:35.360
house to make you fire your gun off and

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.960
like [ __ ] this i didn't want to kill

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:38.400
this guy but i'm not getting hacked to

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.880
death but it's psycho if it was a movie

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.719
you would be cheering for the robbers

01:36:42.719 --> 01:36:44.239
you'd be like holy [ __ ] they broke into

01:36:44.239 --> 01:36:45.200
the predator's house

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.199
[Laughter]

01:36:47.199 --> 01:36:49.280
[ __ ] hopefully they kill him yeah that

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.400
dude that must have been funny it always

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.760

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:53.119
in different parts of the house just

01:36:53.119 --> 01:36:54.960

panther hostage for two weeks and just

that was so another former gift that was

01:40:56.239 --> 01:40:58.239

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:05.840
slogan that's right oh that's an

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.600
all-right slogan all the way all lives

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.800
matter because it was like well there

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.400
was like black lives matter then people

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:12.719
were like no all lives matter but it was

01:41:12.719 --> 01:41:13.920
like

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.000
oh yeah it wasn't like it wasn't like a

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.719

shut up i agree with like the sentiment

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.159
i don't align then i guess with the

01:41:26.159 --> 01:41:28.000
other belief systems that that ushers in

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.360
well it's yeah it's one of those things

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.800
where it's like technically yeah totally

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.560

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:37.840
when he moved to america they didn't

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.199
know

01:42:39.199 --> 01:42:41.760
their culture sucked so bad in egypt

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:44.560
that they didn't know girls wore pink

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:46.480

01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:57.119
days of school in like a giant pink

01:42:57.119 --> 01:42:59.600

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:04.639
different school

01:43:04.639 --> 01:43:06.320

01:43:16.239 --> 01:43:18.080
early 90s

01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:20.320

01:44:20.639 --> 01:44:22.960
the idea of someone in the early 90s

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:25.280
unknowingly wearing pink is the funniest

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.760

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.119
offense yeah or you're like i actually

01:46:07.119 --> 01:46:08.800
was born here there was a live ad there

01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.239
was a good article in the atlantic about

01:46:10.239 --> 01:46:12.239
some muslim guy wrote it the lady who

01:46:12.239 --> 01:46:14.159
said immigrants get it done but it was a

01:46:14.159 --> 01:46:16.960
complete [ __ ] dork dork exactly but

01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:18.800
then there was people who saw that

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:20.080
they're like

01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:21.760
it leveled up and they're like

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:24.000
actually somebody should make a meme of

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.080
the [ __ ] home depot truck in new york

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:27.679
that ran over all those people and say

01:46:27.679 --> 01:46:29.600
immigrants get it done

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.119
well i guarantee that exists too [ __ ] it

01:46:33.119 --> 01:46:35.119
i guarantee you exist but saying

01:46:35.119 --> 01:46:36.800
immigrants get it done is is such a

01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:39.440
[ __ ] ass it's so [ __ ] annoying well

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:42.080
i mean that doesn't bother me i i know

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:43.600
you're saying the sentiment is just like

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.520
shut up shut up it's so stupid yeah

01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.920
definitely but to think of being like

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:50.000
imagine seeing that and being like like

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.199
you're being like it's stupid it's you

01:46:51.199 --> 01:46:53.119
know yeah i love it imagine that being

01:46:53.119 --> 01:46:54.960
like actually you're committing

01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:57.520
i love the uh the next level where there

01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.199
is someone tries to be liberal and then

01:46:59.199 --> 01:47:00.639
a harder liberal comes in is that that

01:47:00.639 --> 01:47:02.239
is actually

01:47:02.239 --> 01:47:04.159
me you're doing it i love doing that i

01:47:04.159 --> 01:47:05.840
like i personally enjoy it it is fun

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:07.360
that is fun like if i hear somebody

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:08.800
trying to be liberal i try to be like

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.560
well actually what you're doing is

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:11.679
offensive

01:47:11.679 --> 01:47:13.360
like last week you said jungle fever and

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:14.880
i was like well matt i was unaware that

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.239
was offensive honestly it's very

01:47:16.239 --> 01:47:18.080
problematic yeah no idea i thought i

01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:19.199
always just heard it in a pleasant

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:21.280
context so it's interesting yeah but

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:23.360

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:24.719

01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:52.320

01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.639
or like i would my i talk about how i

01:50:54.639 --> 01:50:56.239
i'm like i hooked up with a teacher when

01:50:56.239 --> 01:50:58.080
i was in high school there's always a

01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:59.760
comedian in the car or somebody in the

01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:02.719
crowd that's like what was his name

01:51:02.719 --> 01:51:04.639

that dude that's

01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.320

01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:50.159

02:03:04.639 --> 02:03:06.719
um jordan peterson was recently on

02:03:06.719 --> 02:03:07.850
pretty much all i do

02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:09.440
[Laughter]

02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:11.199
peterson was recently on jocko i don't

02:03:11.199 --> 02:03:12.480
know if you heard that no but he was

02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:14.560
talking about uh this one woman that he

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:16.400
had been counseled and she wanted to he

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:17.840
had been counseling her and she wanted

02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:19.840
to triple her salary and so he's like

02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:20.639
all right well the first thing we're

02:03:20.639 --> 02:03:22.880
gonna do is get your resume in order

02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:24.080
and then we're gonna start sending it

02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:25.599
out and he's like i'm not just talking

02:03:25.599 --> 02:03:27.520
about sending it out ten times i'm

02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:29.040
talking about sending it out five times

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:31.520
a day for two years because this and i

02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:33.199
heard that and i was just like it was

02:03:33.199 --> 02:03:35.440
like 10 30 at night like doing push-ups

02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:37.840
send it out sitting down like mature you

02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:39.599
know it's like you gotta do it yeah he

02:03:39.599 --> 02:03:40.840
had me in chain eating meat and

02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:43.599
vegetables like i i hit the wall in

02:03:43.599 --> 02:03:45.440
oklahoma

02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:46.880
the fact that i went out and bought

02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:48.320
broccoli because of that i was like i'm

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:50.159
going to eat meat i had those podcasts

02:03:50.159 --> 02:03:51.599
like i just eat meat and vegetables last

02:03:51.599 --> 02:03:52.639
night for dinner

02:03:52.639 --> 02:03:54.639
i had baked chicken and steamed

02:03:54.639 --> 02:03:56.480
vegetables dude that's how you feel yeah

02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:57.760
and i cleaned my room a little and then

02:03:57.760 --> 02:03:59.920
i did yoga at two in the morning dude

02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:01.440
then i went to sleep and now i woke up

02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:03.280
at 1 pm

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:05.599
it's too late to do yoga that's not bad

02:04:05.599 --> 02:04:07.119
though but uh

02:04:07.119 --> 02:04:08.239
yeah

02:04:08.239 --> 02:04:09.920
i need that and then i get those moments

02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:11.440
too it's just like [ __ ] it i just need

02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:13.920
to send my stuff out and i'll just email

02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:15.440
bookers and [ __ ]

02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:17.280
i do regret doing that but there's

02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:19.040
there's a weird line in stand up stand

02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:21.280
up stand up particularly there's a weird

02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:23.360
line between

02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:25.760
overdoing it and not doing it at all

02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:27.679
and i tend to err on the side of not

02:04:27.679 --> 02:04:29.119
promoting not

02:04:29.119 --> 02:04:30.960
no i don't put myself out there at all

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:33.199
compared to a lot of my [ __ ]

02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:35.040
contemporaries

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:36.800
like there's a lot of [ __ ] comics out

02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:38.719
there that are just everywhere it's just

02:04:38.719 --> 02:04:40.480
a picture with your face on it and like

02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:42.960
obviously six open mics yeah i did that

02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:43.920
once

02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:46.080
i put a picture of more like with my

02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:47.440
schedule yeah but everyone goes through

02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:48.719
that because where you're like

02:04:48.719 --> 02:04:50.000
yeah people ask me they're like where

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.239
the [ __ ] where are you gonna be

02:04:52.239 --> 02:04:53.440
there's really if you think about it

02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:54.719
nothing wrong with that but i'm the same

02:04:54.719 --> 02:04:55.920
way when i see it i'm like i'm not

02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:58.080
[ __ ] doing that no i'll never do that

02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:00.320
i feel weird the thing that i would for

02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:02.080
you but this is just as a fan of your

02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:03.920
comedy i would like to hear and i've

02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:05.520
told you this before even if it's just

02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:08.719
audio from your sets because you are

02:05:08.719 --> 02:05:10.320
willing to

02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:12.800
have a go with the audience yeah that

02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:14.400
and then to hear you talk about it on

02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:15.760
the podcast and kind of break it down

02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:17.360
like i want to hear you talk that's a

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:18.800
good idea because you do talk about

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:20.480
enough difference you're you're not like

02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:22.080
you know and i think you would build a

02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:23.440
following there then it would even cut

02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.679
the ropes loose even more because it's a

02:05:25.679 --> 02:05:27.920
sick idea then you're like i know i know

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:29.760

i didn't do it that's actually a good

02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:18.320
idea dude you [ __ ] should that way

02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:20.000
all your stuff's relevant you just put

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.560
it out and then

02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:23.920
it's tough it's tough it's really hard

02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:26.159
to self-promote without if you have any

02:06:26.159 --> 02:06:27.679
dignity you feel helium if you were like

02:06:27.679 --> 02:06:29.040
i'm going to do a special helium

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:31.040
especially if i got you and mckeever on

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:32.719
it that'd be so funny you mean mckeever

02:06:32.719 --> 02:06:34.480
and maybe the gerbers if he was willing

02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:36.000
no no i'd they'd be there as a fan you

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.520
know why don't you do stand up

02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:40.560
i i i don't i don't have the i can't

02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:42.639
okay yeah i hit that point where i just

02:06:42.639 --> 02:06:44.159
i'll do it but i hit a point where i

02:06:44.159 --> 02:06:45.920
doesn't like

02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:48.159
i got turned off by it

02:06:48.159 --> 02:06:50.000
in philly like my three favorite comics

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.679
just don't do stand up

02:06:51.679 --> 02:06:54.079
you two and mckeever yeah it's weird a

02:06:54.079 --> 02:06:54.960
hundred

02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:56.079
just don't

02:06:56.079 --> 02:06:58.159
it's like if you're good enough like i

02:06:58.159 --> 02:06:59.760
just got done you're smart enough to be

02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.440
good at stand up you usually quit

02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:03.119
because

02:07:03.119 --> 02:07:05.119
that's how [ __ ] stupid it is well it

02:07:05.119 --> 02:07:06.560
wasn't even that i just got sick of it

02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:08.239
i'd just be like i don't feel like doing

02:07:08.239 --> 02:07:09.760
this anymore yeah it's

02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:12.159
the work into it it's a nice treat when

02:07:12.159 --> 02:07:13.360
i get up there and i haven't done in a

02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:14.639
while and i get to do it i'm like oh man

02:07:14.639 --> 02:07:17.280
this is so fun it is so funny when it's

02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:18.560
good dude it's the best thing in the

02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:19.840
world yeah

02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:21.440
but when you're sitting in the back of

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:23.760
an open mic watching yeah

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:25.920
or even at a show when you're just like

02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:28.719
if i'm at uncle vinnie's

02:07:28.719 --> 02:07:31.199
getting paid 75 dollars to drive up to

02:07:31.199 --> 02:07:32.639
[ __ ] jersey

02:07:32.639 --> 02:07:34.560
and i think to get yelled at if somebody

02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:36.239
doesn't do stand-up one of the things

02:07:36.239 --> 02:07:37.840
that's really tough about it too is

02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:39.760
there's so much time before and after

02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:42.320
the show where your your peer group

02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:45.920
is like less than desirable mm-hmm and

02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:48.239
that's what you are networking with

02:07:48.239 --> 02:07:50.079
and when i moved to new york to do it

02:07:50.079 --> 02:07:51.280
because

02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:53.199
i had gotten like

02:07:53.199 --> 02:07:55.280

circuit is no i can't even discuss it

02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:21.360

to be around yes so the and then you it

02:08:39.599 --> 02:08:41.119
