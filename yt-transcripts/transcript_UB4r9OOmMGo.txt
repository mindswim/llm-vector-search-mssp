00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.980
[Music]

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.780
Desperado Rough Rider no you don't want

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.300
NADA Bill Barber was a popular teacher

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.859
and football coach at Garnet Valley

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.380
Middle School but State Police say he

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.600
used that position to sexually assault a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.880
former student in his office two weeks

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.439
ago but your body makes me crazy

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.079
this podcast is about positivity ugh

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.180
bringing positivity into people's lives

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.059
because people really need it especially

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.280
after the dark couple of years we've had

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.920
which I feel very sorry for all those

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.120
people have had to go through all those

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.840
hardships sorry guys rules for the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.379
podcast uh I will not allow any

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.980
conversations about drugs or Weaponry or

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.640
violence mass shootings massacres or any

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.440
devastating events that happened in the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.960
past none of those things because they

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.640
could could trigger bad memories and

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.860
cause people to become offended but some

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.560
of them are pretty touchy subjects most

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.320
importantly my podcast has a strict no

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.600
covert talk policy which means nobody

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.340
including myself is allowed to talk

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.200
about anything related to the virus

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.140
including lockdowns politics and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.060
vaccines people have heard enough about

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.200

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.600
getting a

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.220
the sex offenders we're talking about on

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.299
the way down it was nothing but like

00:18:09.299 --> 00:18:11.160
this sex offender who did like blah blah

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.860
I think that guy's wife got sick and

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.539
then he was like you know she was like

00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:17.280
really sick and then he started having

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.400
an affair with a young lady

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.840

another sex offender I don't want to

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.120
Smite the guy's reputation we talked

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.320
about a lot of sex offenders on the way

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.120
down to Kenneth Square so I could be

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.500
getting them mixed up I don't want to

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.940
Smite the guys so if you're telling me

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.580

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:03.900
if you're under a lot of stress and

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.600
there's I'll be honest probably the

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.080
Irish were on they were it was on a

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.460
humongous screen right above my head I

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.260
was sitting there like that Shane's

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.460
happy

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.380
dude yeah that was fun though it was fun

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.840
we uh it was a good old time we all went

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.200
outside I texted Billy I said let's go

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.240
also destroy Haas

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.860
and he said I asked him if he was born

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.980
in 1962. and then he said he thinks he

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.740
can rep 135 to 100 faster than I could

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.900
yeah that's that's a challenge either of

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.179
them can rep 135 100. they were they

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:10.320
were claiming they're gonna put it down

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.080
Haas can't Rebel 135 he bags it horse

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.559
bags

00:23:15.559 --> 00:23:17.700
he was saying like 15 minutes or

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.620
something crazy I I don't have time to

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.840
rest Whoever has time to do it even dude

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.120
that's crazy though yeah that's 10 sets

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.960
of 10 sets of 10. a 45 bad if you lift

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.419
true if you lift you could do that yeah

00:23:30.419 --> 00:23:32.480
you're probably right

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.600
three sets of it nope the trick is you

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.340
get you put the 25s on but from the

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.380
deadlift thing so you get the big 25s

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.120
and then you stack but it looks like

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.700
you're rapping yeah you're [ __ ]

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.960
combine dude but yeah that was fun man I

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.419
got I ended up thought I wasn't drunk

00:23:48.419 --> 00:23:50.820
towards the end of the night I was uh I

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.500
was pretty loose lip dude I was [ __ ] I

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.700

00:23:58.919 --> 00:24:00.600
for two days dude I was I had to go to

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.659
Sky Zone I was at Sky Zone Sky Zone the

00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:06.120
next day yeah like the indoor trampoline

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.400

from the ground like

00:24:19.799 --> 00:24:21.659
that was so disappointing when I did

00:24:21.659 --> 00:24:23.460
that yeah indoor skydiving you just

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.380
hover an inch off the ground with VR on

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.360
dude I'm too top heavy I would [ __ ]

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.940
just spin dude I barely caught air

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.799
I barely called [ __ ] air I was so

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.400
stopped and then I got back to the

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.980
parents house but I was so drunk that's

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.460
so drunk I I when I realized when I

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.960
realized how much alcohol was in my

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.220
system that I was probably like right on

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.200
the edge of 0.08 I was like I'm gonna

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.539
smoke a ton of weed counteract this

00:25:00.539 --> 00:25:04.620
hangover sure so I dude I like pigged

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.120
out on an entire cone like a big old

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.039
cone nice than I do when I was driving

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:09.659
home it was just like oh before you

00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:11.640
drove it was this was like it was like

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.679
an hour before so I did that towards the

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:15.299
end of the night we got bust back I got

00:25:15.299 --> 00:25:17.940
my cousin drove me back and uh I got in

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:18.960
the car and I was like I'm good to go

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.580
and dude I was just like

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.820
I got home and dude Bae came down it was

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.620
this I haven't done this in a while she

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.900
came down and she was like what are you

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.940
doing I was like dude I was standing in

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.020
the kitchen I was standing in the middle

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.580
of the kitchen with my phone so it

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.320
looked bad yeah and I just turned around

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.940
I was like

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.080
um researching how to make ambient music

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.240
I'd been looking up 432 Hertz like this

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.279
now you know you know about 440 right no

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:46.679
dude you're being [ __ ] poison bro

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:48.840
was the Nazis I don't know who it is the

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.080
head Nazi in charge maybe gerbils he was

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.120
apparently according to YouTube uh you

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.140
know I have to check this out I want to

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.299
spread this info you don't want to

00:25:57.299 --> 00:25:59.640
tarnish is it gerbil's name you want to

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.080
spread this information here he's got

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.039
enough to worry about I don't want to

00:26:02.039 --> 00:26:04.260
crush him fully but I mean dude this

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.700
info you know this info is a heavy

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.000
charge these days so they

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:09.600
um

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.820
they were saying he changed the standard

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.220
tuning to 440 which is like it's bad for

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.700
you it [ __ ] you up 432 though oh what

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.559
are these numbers they're like the

00:26:19.559 --> 00:26:21.600
frequencies of the music they emit oh

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.980
okay so it's like if you were to put

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.919
like uh sand on a paper and hit it with

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:29.700
432 Hertz it'll make a cool pattern 440

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.080
it probably just makes golden curl I

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.299
don't know what it does it's [ __ ]

00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:34.740
it's bad and they switched it but you

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.480
should be listening to music in 432 it's

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.799
a healing frequency

00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:40.559
so I was downstairs looking up how to

00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:42.480
make ambient music yes and I'm sitting

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.980
there like with headphones holding my

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.240
phone I was like heating up I have like

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.440

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.000
things like he I have two guys you're

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.679
heating up gluten-free I have two in the

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:50.820
other trying to figure out the evil

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.320
frequencies yeah I was in there it's

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.820
like she's like you're [ __ ] up I was

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.400

The Rock's a [ __ ] though dude the rock

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:11.879

00:34:11.879 --> 00:34:13.079
team I didn't bring that up the team

00:34:13.079 --> 00:34:15.060
would agree for sure actually they

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.040
probably like to watch the team likes

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.460
all that [ __ ] to the teams dude they

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.139
love that uh you think it's probably

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:23.339
nice though to have someone else up

00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:25.320
early as hell with you I don't know I

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.399
don't know if they get up early like

00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:27.899
that do you think the teams when they're

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.460
I think the team's probably slept in

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.339
after Saturday they get [ __ ] up bro

00:34:32.339 --> 00:34:34.139
yeah I know someone who went to a

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:35.220
wedding with firefighters and

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:36.419
firefighters apparently like

00:34:36.419 --> 00:34:38.220
firefighters they're not the team a

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.119
little different than the team they're

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:40.379
not the teams they're not the teams but

00:34:40.379 --> 00:34:41.879
I heard firefighters firefighters are

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:43.679
basically and they apparently a lot of

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.780
them party on mushrooms the firefighters

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.440
yeah dude what if the siren goes dude

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.480
that's they'd be Berserkers just spray

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.919
it they'd be berserk because they can't

00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:54.839
really drink like that yeah because he

00:34:54.839 --> 00:34:55.859
had the wrong call so yeah I was on

00:34:55.859 --> 00:34:58.800
mushroom staring into a flame at your

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.660
bachelor party right it was hell yeah

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.339
dude I guess they can't imagine they

00:35:02.339 --> 00:35:03.540
probably just munch like little bits

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.859
here and there having to rush into that

00:35:04.859 --> 00:35:05.579
thing

00:35:05.579 --> 00:35:07.800
right into the blaze I might let it

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.780
consume me yeah I might have to stand

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.740
there and be like this is gonna feel

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.440
good as soon as it starts

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.720
build a temple on these

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.480
one thing I was there was a uh I was

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.760
staying in a cool hotel and they had a

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.800
cool

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.200
uh pool a roof deck pool

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.720
that my hotel room could open up into

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.880
like it was a sick room nice but there

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.359
was a party for Zillow the real estate

00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:36.500
company they blocked it off on Saturday

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.520

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.760
though swam yeah

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.500
I stood I sat over and lifted my head

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.310
over my fence

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:45.800

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.680
farmer spends I think 50 billion a year

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.900
on Advertising whoa It's a lot of money

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.599
bro so if they have so much money it's

00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:18.240
crazy to 50 billion yeah I wonder what

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.380
they could do for mental health with

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.660
that type of money

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:23.400
okay yeah they could cure probably

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.780
things yeah they could do some good

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.960
stuff 50 bill 50 Bill apparently I I you

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.280
know double check the Gnomes but it's in

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.720
the billions of dollars somebody needs

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.880
to figure out how to fix these bombs

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.060
San Diego is destroyed dude I was saying

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.220

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.680
needles

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.780
give them the needles and then I say at

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.000
least they're safe

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.440
uh [ __ ] you know what I'm saying this

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.060
comedian I was with she had a good idea

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.920
what we were talking about because we

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.660
were talking about eradicating the bumps

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:54.119
yeah and how we should go about it and

00:43:54.119 --> 00:43:56.220
she was like Molly capsules with

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.500

and then slowly Fade to nothing

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.560
it's not a bad idea

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.660
so that was that was her that was her

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.060

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.460
one you run into you go down out west

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.180

they are gonna bite somebody yeah if you

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.359

I my brother's friend beat the [ __ ] out

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.099
of a bum with a bottle of Gatorade one

00:47:29.099 --> 00:47:31.859

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.540
wrestling he grabbed he had like a 32

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:38.400
ounce Blue Frost and he started [ __ ]

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.960
bashing him crunching him in the head

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.180
with it I think the bomb started excuse

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.460
me I think the uh the housing

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.800
disadvantages started a fight with him

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.240

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.700
barley [ __ ] arm bar I believe so I

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.559

had to uh he put a bum in an arm bar

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.280
yeah I think he had to [ __ ] protect

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.839
himself at that point you had the bomb

00:47:57.839 --> 00:47:59.520
was they don't tap that's back when guys

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.040
could protect themselves back when you

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.839
could do cool wrestling moves to bombs

00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:05.040
on the street

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.380

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:11.460
young man being like that's really

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.160
[ __ ] up yeah I remember I I I'll be

honest I've gotten older I've grown into

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.720
the idea of it and I'm like yeah do it I

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.760
mean dude we could have a UFC round

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.260
or it's hell on a cell and he's put like

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:24.540
40 of them in there

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.940
dude if we did it would be interesting

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.500
to see what the opioid boys could do

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.260
against the the math bombs they're

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.520
obviously the heavy favorite but you

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.040
never know oh yeah they'll be a boy

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.660
could wake up and start getting fired up

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.760
dude I wonder if you can if you even can

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.579
raid John heroin probably opiates do

00:48:41.579 --> 00:48:43.500
make you angry if you take too many you

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.380
can get really angry the uh if you gave

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.400
him something makes sense yeah

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:53.280
yeah if you gave them [ __ ] with Narcan

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.480
if you hit him with Narcan right before

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.579
the fight dude that would be

00:48:56.579 --> 00:48:58.260
they're pissed that could be their seats

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.780
bro so the meth boys would be dominating

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.119
but they that's their Madness could keep

00:49:03.119 --> 00:49:05.059
narcanic back awake

00:49:05.059 --> 00:49:07.559
they're tired out the [ __ ] meth boys

00:49:07.559 --> 00:49:09.960
yeah that's that's their Mad Max thing

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:13.260

00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:16.559
it just all the heroin leaves her body

00:49:16.559 --> 00:49:17.520
and they enter into like I think

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.599
withdrawal or so I don't know what

00:49:18.599 --> 00:49:20.099

00:49:20.099 --> 00:49:20.819
all

00:49:20.819 --> 00:49:22.680
and they're not feeling much pain that's

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.839
the other thing true both of them would

00:49:24.839 --> 00:49:27.599
never feel pain the metabolism what

00:49:27.599 --> 00:49:29.160

one thing they both swing and fall it's

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.900
so [ __ ] funny dude yeah that would be

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.020
God that would be I'm staking well if

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.940
PCP boys are different than the meth

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:27.059
guys I'm taking the pcps yeah man the

00:50:27.059 --> 00:50:28.380
method from what I've witnessed I've

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.300
witnessed the power dude I've seen they

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.280

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:35.339
Barefoot sprinting around all day

00:50:35.339 --> 00:50:38.880

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.119
robot dogs to take on the math bombs

00:50:42.119 --> 00:50:43.859

00:50:43.859 --> 00:50:45.960
that's a good move if we stick the bots

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:49.020
on them that would do the wedge this is

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:51.079
the wedge

00:50:51.079 --> 00:50:53.819
just popping up a scabbed Barefoot off

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.960
the whole time I can't imagine meth must

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.900

00:54:36.059 --> 00:54:38.579
you wake up one day like [ __ ] yeah be

00:54:38.579 --> 00:54:40.980
like maybe I'm wrong yeah man especially

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:42.240
when you're like

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.040
there's dudes who do that that [ __ ]

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.420
where you kind of like lightly squat for

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:46.740
the winter time you get a PL you like

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.180
scramble together a thing get a place

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.880
then you're just like I don't have to

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.500
worry about money for like six months no

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.900
kick me out it's kind of chill

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.599
I support them I take back about killing

00:54:57.599 --> 00:54:59.040
them we don't need to kill them I don't

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.000
even need to kill them I think we need

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.400
to make them

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.720
the problem is according to the drug

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.339
class and then they can use the money

00:55:05.339 --> 00:55:06.960
for the fights to fund low-income

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.520
housing that they can destroy slowly and

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.960
then we'll just keep them keep doing it

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.339
yeah keep them fighting we got dude we

00:55:11.339 --> 00:55:12.720
gotta figure something I just want to

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.760
find something sustainable it's the it's

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:18.299
the drugs yeah it's just the drugs true

00:55:18.299 --> 00:55:19.440
so what do you think we could probably

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.960
just hook them up then we could kill all

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.299
these bombs and then say no more drugs

00:55:24.299 --> 00:55:28.200
yeah I also wonder if super I also

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.579
wonder if that's how the super super

00:55:29.579 --> 00:55:32.940
wealthy view us being like Oh yeah dude

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:34.559
the middle class we should [ __ ] bomb

00:55:34.559 --> 00:55:37.500
we should uh release opioid

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.599
prescriptions and uh tell people to

00:55:39.599 --> 00:55:41.460
learn yeah

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.440
that's what they did pretty much it is

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:46.079

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.480

field of frequencies that you manipulate

01:03:07.799 --> 01:03:09.180
