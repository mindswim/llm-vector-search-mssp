yeah but that was his boy who that was

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.640
like they all have so they all have a

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.880
slightly less hot sidekick

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.039
nobody's hotter than exactly ryan garcia

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.399
ryan garcia is the hottest but he

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.800
that guy was ryan garcia's slightly less

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.840
hot sidekick

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.840
yes and then that guy's slightly less

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.440
hot sidekick he's getting hotter

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.560
he looks like my math teacher mr horn

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.239
his slightly less hot sidekick he's like

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.720
a short italian dude

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.400
he's an apprentice hot guy he went too

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.760
not hot it's it throws

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.840
girls do this on all of girls dating

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.360
profile pictures with their friends they

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.120
they they have all girls have like a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.200
fake relationship with a girl who's like

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.120
not as hot as them so they think poorly

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.640
homely

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.720
homely sidekick they took note from

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.640
girls like oh i need a slightly less hot

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.319
side kick so my tick tock pops

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.560
jesus because it's too disorganized if

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.400
you have guys who are like all the exact

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.920
same hotness unless they're all no they

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.599
do the one does dude who is it which

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.680
one's that one of them has it

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.680
one of my god my main the main guy one

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.920
of the main guy houses taylor's

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.280
sidekick is also jacked tanner he's more

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.319
tan

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.959
equally his

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.120
i think tanner might surpass taylor

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.159
with an e taylor with a knee

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.000
taylor that's a battle dude who which

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.200
ones and they all i think they all

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.760
spawned

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.599
from logan paul tan are you talking

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.519
about tanner

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.599
probably this all started from logan

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.440
paul filming a japanese dude that killed

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.480
himself

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.480
and it's spawned the whole way there's a

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.560
curse in that suicide forest in japan

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.680

think about oh we oh

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.960

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.040

form a hot guy group we have to start

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.400

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.560
chinese communist party wins

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.479

[ __ ] down oh he has to he probably saw a

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.039
couple of his videos and was like no

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.400
the military is probably depleting

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.080

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.240

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.520

algorithm found you

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.960
i think you hit just like the lowest

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.039
level of success that like the pedophile

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.360
algorithms like we can get him

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.479
true it works dude you're on the space i

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.280
understand

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.919
i understand you start traveling dudes

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:26.400
and pools

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.680
true free spacey if this is if this was

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.600
the temptation space he was hit with

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.360
[Laughter]

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.600
i wonder dude tracy did nothing wrong if

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.560
if you've

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.919
yeah nobody ever found like wasn't he

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:38.960

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.600
travolta

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.240
travolta got a message stacey was just

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.840
getting it he grabbed a dick at a

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.880
nightclub

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.520
someone brought a 16 year old boy into a

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.280
nightclub and i think spacey grabbed his

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.440
dick

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.000
he got terry crews at nightclub dude

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.520
think of a 16 year old like all that

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.880
like excited be like this is gonna be

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.240
[ __ ] cool man i'm going into a

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.600
nightclub for the first time like kevin

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.120
spacey comes out of nowhere

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.360
dude spacey you have like one second to

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.840
be like is that kevin smith oh

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.919
yeah if you go to a hollywood party it's

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.520
nothing i mean i i don't i've never been

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.280
to one but the reason i try to avoid it

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.680
is because i would have to wear a cup

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.840
otherwise it would be like spacey see

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.600
chris you'll probably finger my butt

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.199
if they saw you trotting around dude

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.840
that thick ass i just ran 2.8 miles

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:08.479
peak of a democracy when

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:09.680

you display her body for the world and

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.360
then like slowly she just gets

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.000
completely excavated by just people just

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.120

hand the 16 year old keys to a kingdom

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.360
that they have no control of

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.880

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.560

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.639
definitely

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:06.639
we had this whole period when we grew up

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:08.000
of boy bands

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.600

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.120
sick thing we have a horrible confession

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.680

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.160
boy band it's okay

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.120

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.320
common enough that it was a south park

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.480

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:44.880
the yoko that was our it ripped us apart

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.320
that's what keeps all the boy bands

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.360
performing they just

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.800
they make their boy band and they flood

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.000
the rest of the boys with porn and it's

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.440
hard to kind of get it together yeah

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.720

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.079

they've used a video on trl and uh up to

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.279
that point i think

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:18.480
the little girls are mostly getting

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.920
turned on by like your jonathan taylor

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.519

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.279
[Laughter]

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:30.720
nsync just starts blowing up tween [ __ ]

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.240
and you're sitting there and just the tv

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.360
in the living room is playing a new end

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.120
sync video and you look over and your 12

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.560
year old daughter just has like

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.959
beads of sweat like forming on her

00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:39.760
hairline

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.079
oh and you're just like what and your

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:43.600
entire life is different from them

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.760
well if you watch so i i saw a [ __ ] man

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.279
this was like four years ago i watched

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:48.320
uh

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.240
it was either nsync or backstreet boys

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.000
but like back in 2001

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.440
and it was like if they had done that

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.360
today they would have it would have got

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.320
cancelled because they like very openly

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.000
and like without any sort of like

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.279
this is a little bit weird they were

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:04.399
dressed like exactly like they like took

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:05.920
mannequins in a store that would

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.839
primarily deal with like uh clothes for

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:08.800
black people and just like

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.639
pulled them off threw them like like

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:12.560
backwards fubu jerseys on nsync when

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.120
like

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.880
white dudes didn't do that because they

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.079
were just like oh we're going to fully

00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:17.519
dress you guys like black dudes

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:19.440
have you do music that's primarily

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.959
dominated by black dudes and they're

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:22.000
just [ __ ] it

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.480
they must have killed 12. one twelve

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.760
what i'm saying i've been furious it was

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.639
like 112

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:28.079
boys and they were just like oh that's

00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:29.120
kind of cool and they're like we'll just

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.920
have white dudes

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.360
the elvis saying they did it again we do

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.560
it like more marketable

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:36.959
dude that that tween like the beatles

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.000
had it the [ __ ]

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.079
i remember i don't know how true it is

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.279
but you know the same thing

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:43.279
do you know that really the beatles took

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:45.760
place blues extremely black music

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.000
and then sold it to white people in a

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.199
country where they weren't buying the

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:50.320
black version and then they sergeant

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.440
peppered and it was like

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.800
okay now you guys are your own thing now

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.560
we're doing white stuff i mean

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.839
that was the next level and then jimi

00:14:55.839 --> 00:14:58.480
hendrix appropriated that true

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.079
call it even even stephen

00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:03.680
well there was elvis i think elvis was a

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.760
pretty glaring example

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.079
yeah but uh there was a thing and there

00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:09.920
was a documentary on the rolling stones

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.519
and they were talking about how the

00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:14.320
women would go so crazy

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.160
that there were rivers of piss

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.959
coming down the steps like there was

00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:22.480
that much

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.199
really the women just started squirting

00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:27.279
women piss like scared animals

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:29.440
yeah like an excited dog how is it not

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.720
talked about constantly everyone i know

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.399
pisses their pants constantly

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:34.560
actually uh do you really like micro pee

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.519
to bed

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:38.079
i micro peed the bed last night when you

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:39.680
let out your first streaming out

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.360
shut this wait you let out a full stream

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.959
no just like

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:45.199
like a jolt i guess a jolt yeah i was

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:47.360
having a dude i had a [ __ ] dream

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.959
when you're done peeing and you can jolt

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:50.399
a couple of times no

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.920
it's like the first jolt when you when

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.680
you as soon as you zip and hit the

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.000
toilet

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.079
seat and let it go every time i'm away

00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:57.680
like when i i'm about to pee and like

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.560
when i'm sleeping

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.160
i usually almost do that and wake up but

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.320
i actually let out like up

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.480
nice kim peed came back in and laid on

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.000
it and shielded this spot from so he

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.519
pissed in the bed and then hit it free a

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:08.240
little bit yeah

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.079
a very little bit pissed the badge off

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:11.759
that you were ashamed as an adult

00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:14.320
i had a dream last night that not all

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.040
but like

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.680
probably a ton of my male relationships

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.959
the people in my life

00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:21.040

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.519
like an old

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.639
jiu jitsu teacher i was like hey i'm

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:30.399
thinking of signing up and he was like

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:31.440
the problem with you dude is you're

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.040
always trying to be the [ __ ] hero

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.639

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.320
dude so then i have a dream of all

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.440
that's why i woke up at 4 30 in the

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.519
morning all my relationships crumbled

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:48.000
and then i peed the bed

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.079
i shot pee at the very end at the very

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:51.600
end of this i was like walking away just

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.000
like

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.519
from my old jiu-jitsu coach

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.800
no i was very ashamed i was like man

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.639

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:01.360
mine

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.279

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:04.799
in a spirit of vengeance i was like i'm

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:06.240
gonna use this guy's private jet and

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.199
then they're like it'll be fifteen

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:08.400
hundred dollars and fill it up and i was

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:08.720
like

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.079
never mind and then i peed the bed

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.600

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.919
you saying you snake and i just oh yeah

00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:17.520

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:36.880

well they

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.480

then you woke up to me and be like yeah

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.640
you're a real piece of [ __ ]

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.760
these are the dangers of sleeping enough

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.360
yeah man i think i'm getting i think i'm

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.720
getting my rem rebound because i've been

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.720
on like three four hours for so long

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.000
and then i take my mouth shut so i got

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.679
all kinds of nitric oxide don't explain

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:56.640
that to me

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.720
why are you thinking so so you want to

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.559
you want to primarily nose breathe

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:02.240
so you know it's just better for you it

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.480
gets you know in terms of vasodilation

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.760
all this other stuff it gets your

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.280
when you breathe through your nose it

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.960
gives like nitric oxide into your body

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.640
or nitrous whatever the [ __ ] it's called

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.760
whatever that stuff isn't and then

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.440
they'll explode and violence gives you

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.559
boners and [ __ ]

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:15.919
muscle veins it's what makes you run

00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:18.159
fast yeah exactly you turn on the nose

00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:21.280
just right into the nose so if you tape

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.720
your mouth shut while you're sleeping

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.400
you only nose breathe and you're it's

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.000
like a better way to breathe because it

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.400
actually

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.520
when you breathe in through your nose

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.360
you're activating your sympathetic

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.320
nervous system or you know your

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.760
parasympathetic nervous system which

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.960
slows you down when you breathe through

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.559
your mouth you're more activating your

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:36.799
sympathetic nervous system so just it's

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:37.760
been found

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.039
and it's pretty widely accepted it's

00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:39.919
better for you to breathe through your

00:20:39.919 --> 00:20:41.919
nose but when you sleep when you're at

00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:42.480
nighttime

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.760
typically you lose consciousness and

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.600
just go

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.200

when you tape it

00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:55.679
true you wake up and you're just like

00:20:55.679 --> 00:20:56.799

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.600
finally the kid dude trying to make a

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.520
movie guys horny

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.120
was this family i don't do that supposed

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.559
to be the horniest family of all it was

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:43.679
[ __ ] crazy but then

00:24:43.679 --> 00:24:45.520
the whole time the dad which i think

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.039
this is probably why he did it he had a

00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:48.720
camcorder back in like

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.240
early basically i think the kids same

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.320
age as us and this was all filmed in uh

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.240
like bryn mawr like the places they were

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.760
filming i used to walk

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.799
through there you should walk through

00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:59.200
the i'm not claiming fame but it's like

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.640
i would they're one field i'm like oh

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.679
that's where i used to get off the

00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:03.120
little train and walk to the school they

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.480
were filming in this field

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.039
but i think the dad obsessively filmed

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:08.880
everything going on i guess to like keep

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.919
an eye on things

00:25:09.919 --> 00:25:11.520
but like dude he just filmed himself

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.720
basically like you know the uncle was

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.840
like messing with them the dad would

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.880
like look

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.159
and they like slow down the footage and

00:25:16.159 --> 00:25:17.520
he would just like walk through the

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.080
thing

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.919
but the mom was like dude why didn't you

00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:21.200
tell me so

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.640
they were like lost on this once they

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.320
let out once they said like the dad was

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:24.880

fatherhood i just found out the menendez

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.720
brothers had the same thing

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.679
really did you know that they were

00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:05.200
getting [ __ ] i think this is a netflix

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.960
documentary people probably seen it but

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.399
after when they were on trial for

00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:11.039
killing their parents uh

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:12.399
i first of all i only know about the

00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:14.159
menendez brothers from cable guy so i

00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:15.440
only know about the fake ben stiller

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.640
menendez brothers

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.039
so in real life they went to trial what

00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:20.320
did they do they killed their parents

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.159
okay they were twins they were adult

00:29:22.159 --> 00:29:23.440
twins they killed their parents so hot

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.240
guys have to do

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.159
and their parents were rich perfect so

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:27.520
they were that was the story they're

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.640
trying to get that rich parent money but

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.760
then they go to trial they're like by

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.600
the way my dad was raping us

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.440
and we had to kill him there was nothing

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.039
else we could do but he was dead

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:37.440
he was dead and people were pretty dead

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.200
set on these dudes

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.720
wanting that money so then on the stand

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.480
the secret move that they pull off

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.000
they're like if you don't believe us

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.640
listen to this i think like the older

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.600
menendez brother

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.279
i don't know it's probably minutes older

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:52.799
he gets on the stand he's like

00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:54.559
i took my brother in the woods and i

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:56.080
raped him because my dad raped me

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.000
and then they both tell the same side or

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.840
the same story from opposite sides i was

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.960
like yeah we go in the woods i'd say

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.919
it's time to play

00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:03.039
and then i would just like stick things

00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:04.320
in his [ __ ] and suck his bird and

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.200
stuff like that and then the other

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.320
brother had to be like yep

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.320
totally what happened and that's why we

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.520
killed our parents

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.520
and then like that almost saved them

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.960
like because it was so horrific

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.799
and believable and then at the end

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:16.080
there's like yeah well you still still

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.360
can't [ __ ] yeah we still gotta kill you

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:17.760
guys

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.640
yeah uh we definitely can't have you out

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.760
family sexual abuse is a gift that keeps

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.919
on giving the question is

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.640
okay hold on no let me rephrase that

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.320
yeah that's right this is a gift that

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.279
keeps giving

00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:42.399
they're like we're trying to figure out

00:30:42.399 --> 00:30:44.559

rewind sucking [ __ ] yeah shane was

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.399

true that's right that's where it was i

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.039

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:04.399
damn that would suck to go in there and

00:31:04.399 --> 00:31:06.960
get my ass kicked while attempting to

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.720
rape a house just get jumped

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.120
probably they'd dance on you which would

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.000
actually be

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.080
they'd be like flight 91 it would be

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.080
flight 93 it would be exactly that dude

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.600

like dad's pulling their daughters out

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.039

soccer american soccer is definitely

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:30.159
actually european soccer it's the tick

00:33:30.159 --> 00:33:30.640
tock

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.480
as well well from like an rov

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.000
perspective i would say i would be

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.840
pissed if i was a dad going into that uh

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.360
going into a tic toc house like that

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.640
but times the times are different dude

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.240
your dad's snatching oh if he's ringing

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.279
cross earring out

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:42.960
it's they're not the same anymore like

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.799
there's dads pushing their sons to have

00:33:44.799 --> 00:33:46.080
that's who they want to be that's who

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.600
they want they all want to be odell

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.120
beckham

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.720
that's the guy they want it's drake and

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.799
odell beckham except it's just white

00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:55.519
and they're they're all so rich that

00:33:55.519 --> 00:33:57.279
every instagram picture is them with abs

00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:59.919
holding stacks of money to their ear

00:33:59.919 --> 00:34:02.320
yeah this is kind of i think a thing for

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.840
the elites i don't think poor people or

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.399
even like

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:06.320
middle class people could try to emulate

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.240
this because it's just people

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.200
well you can't you can't emulate it but

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.159
kind of you can definitely

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:13.520
like it crappy house you have like

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.240
pimples on your chest

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.679
your parents couldn't afford braces we

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.320
should start a tic tac this should be

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.399
this cannot be a tick-tock house i was

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:24.000
describing the rest of tick-tock it's

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.800
just autistic

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.560
billy's the only one of us you can you

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.000
might get it you lost some weight but

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.359
give me like billy

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:31.440
billy could be our tick-tock you think

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.359
so he's probably got abs

00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:35.760
no he's [ __ ] strong if we struggle as

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.280
[ __ ] we got billy like shirtless

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.280
not a piano he's strong as [ __ ] but he

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.320
doesn't have abs

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.919
if we got billy shirtless and made him

00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:44.079
like seductively walk to the camera

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:45.520
billy can do it pull his he has his

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.520
glasses dude [ __ ] lower them down

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.879
we could make some money we could pimp

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:50.480
your brother out on tick tock we should

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.599
but this could end

00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:53.119
as like some sort of rewind thing where

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:54.800
you end up sucking him

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.399
true he gets too powerful true

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:02.720
keep rolling

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.480
yeah the dad even rationalized being

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.000
like look as far as my

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.520
middle brother was to me he was just

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.640
trying to show me he loved me in a

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.680
second twisted way

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.520
but the wife was like why didn't you

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.960
tell me your brothers raped you before

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.000
bringing your brothers

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.040
somebody had to give me a head [ __ ] i

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.560
wasn't getting it here

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.680
so i went to my brother he sucked me dry

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.520
i mean how do you how do you chill at

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.119
family parties knowing that you're

00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:27.280
brothers that like slowly

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.200
and just be like dude they were doing

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.320
this thing where you go behind the wall

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.359
and go

00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:34.320
oh he's so silly oh he's probably

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.280
getting raped

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.119
i i would have to i would smash at one

00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:38.240
point and be like dude remember you suck

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.800
my dick what the [ __ ]

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.240
just carving the turkey i don't know

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.079
though it's probably that same energy

00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:45.280
of like if you've hooked up with the

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.960
chick and then you see her later yeah

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.480
you're kind of still like

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.920
yeah what up you and me had something

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.200
i mean they probably have that energy

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.320
with each other where they're just like

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.440
yo you're my mate

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.800
that's your formative sexual experience

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.480
so like you're [ __ ] and you're like i

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.210
just want my brother to suck me

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:02.160
[Laughter]

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.920
like it's never as good again it's never

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.160

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:14.079
brought it

00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:16.960
in my head possibly the worst topic

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.240
we're having fun we're talking about hot

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.359

00:36:19.359 --> 00:36:21.760
documentary about uh incestual tell me

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.400
brother oh god please stop

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.160
we don't believe you it was my brother

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.839
at the beach well apparently too that's

00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:31.119
what they said the problem was you had

00:36:31.119 --> 00:36:33.520
the kid the kid one kid broke the ice

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.720
because he was like

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.320
i think he started grabbing his sister's

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.160
boobs and then they were like

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.760
hey knock that off and he was like

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.240
that's what this is nothing

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.520

about how white parents ruin public

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.079
overall message

and it goes into how which is like this

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.480
it tells a specific story

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.480
about this one school so i guess in new

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.800
york public schools you get like drafted

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.240
to public schools like you apply to

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.599
public schools really not charter

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:24.320
schools

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.520
there's charter schools and public

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.359
schools but you have to like you

00:39:27.359 --> 00:39:29.280
get to try to pick what public school

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.720
you go to kind of

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.760
and these this one dude organized all

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.960
the white parents from this middle

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.000
school

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.079
to go to this one or this elementary

00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:39.760
school to go to this one middle school

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.280
he was like if we all get together and

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.160
demand that they have a french program

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.320
we can go here it's empty nobody's going

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.680
to this school it was like

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.800
half capacity uh so you wanted to wait

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.280
they

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.800
found pocs but then this guy led like

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.400
20 30 white kids to this school

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.040
all in one grade but he was also a

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.320
professional fundraiser

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.640
so he also raised like a hundred

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.680
thousand dollars

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.359
yeah now they got mad because it was

00:40:07.359 --> 00:40:09.280
only going to like french programs

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.839
and [ __ ] like that

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.640
yeah so he kind of what are you [ __ ]

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.440
he took his ski

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.839
he took a school he basically almost

00:40:17.839 --> 00:40:19.359
made like a

00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:20.560
he basically took a school with a bunch

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.839
of other kind of rich white people and

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:23.280
used public funding to have

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.800
like essentially like a private school

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.960
kind of thing or what what yeah he just

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.319
i don't know it's not like it's it's not

00:40:28.319 --> 00:40:29.599
like he was totally like

00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:31.040
innocent or whatever but it was still

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.960
like

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.720
no there was just certain parts where

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.079
they made like an aryan brotherhood for

00:40:36.079 --> 00:40:37.520
a school like as a prison gang yeah

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.480
let's just squat up

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.000
let's get numbers all go together and

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.680
then numbers it was just like

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.200
she was holding white people accountable

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.599
for [ __ ] that she would never hold

00:40:45.599 --> 00:40:47.280
people of color accountable for she

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.800
would be like the white people didn't

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.599
want to be

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:51.680
they were afraid that their kids would

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.640
be

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.160
bullied if they were the only white kid

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.000
in class wait so when

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.200

parent teacher meetings which she

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:08.720

general there'd always be dorks that

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.960
would get upset if you like started

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.520
cheating

i never i don't i made cheat sheets very

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.119

00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:32.079
sheet and i just wouldn't even be able

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:33.440
to bust it out i'd be so nervous

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.599
absolutely i hustler yeah it's a big to

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:36.800

good at it

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.599
that's not that's funny about cheating i

00:45:39.599 --> 00:45:41.200

i can read patterns i'm so good at

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.720
getting patterns right

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.599
on standardized tests all it takes is

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:48.880
the first time you do it and don't get

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.160
caught you're like i might be the best

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.599
at this ever yeah this is all you have

00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:52.400
to do

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.280
yeah i remember the first do you

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.559
you multiple choice algebra

00:48:18.559 --> 00:48:20.800
same tests to both classes so there was

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.000
kids in the first class

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.880
that would just type it in their

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.119
calculator what every single answer was

00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:26.559

actually doing it

00:56:37.599 --> 00:56:38.799

00:56:38.799 --> 00:56:40.319
production though i i think it's that

00:56:40.319 --> 00:56:42.079
yeah it can't be right yeah it's not

00:56:42.079 --> 00:56:42.720

00:56:44.319 --> 00:56:47.280
digging [ __ ] pools by hand man

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.480
they're doing a couple of things and

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.480
editing that in there

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.520
that's like building the [ __ ]

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.760
pyramids how do you who did that

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.920

definitely apocalyptic do you want

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.559
people to if all you're wearing is a

00:56:58.559 --> 00:56:59.040
cloth

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.359
you can do wild [ __ ] if you're only

00:57:01.359 --> 00:57:02.799
wearing a cloth diaper it's true

00:57:02.799 --> 00:57:04.559
you can create seven dudes pulling a

00:57:04.559 --> 00:57:06.880
rope can move anything in the world

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.400
there's not only if they're in cloth

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.480
diapers and sandals

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:11.920
i guess if you want the feeling of like

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.680
somebody dying while on like a project

00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.880

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:18.559
like yeah i mean anyone can have

00:57:18.559 --> 00:57:19.680
anything built but you want people to

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.960
die while building it it's like that's

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.079
pretty cool

00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:23.839
you do want to save the guitar they like

00:57:23.839 --> 00:57:25.119

00:57:25.119 --> 00:57:26.960
right well we'll build 12 stadiums this

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:27.839
year

00:57:27.839 --> 00:57:29.119
everyone's like you sure you how are you

00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:30.880

got a lot of money dudes we got we're

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:35.520
good we just immediately got slaves

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.559
nice guitar parents yeah true they stuck

00:57:38.559 --> 00:57:40.240
a bunch

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.359
there was something i wanted to get to

00:57:41.359 --> 00:57:43.040
with nice white parents but you should

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:43.680
listen to it

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.599
so yeah it's them dude i'm telling you

00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:46.960
that that's who it's for it's for people

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.079
who are too scared to drive through

00:57:48.079 --> 00:57:49.200
black neighborhoods without having like

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.040
a borderline panic attack they're like

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.079
you're gonna listen to this thing it's

00:57:52.079 --> 00:57:53.119
about how white people are really bad

00:57:53.119 --> 00:57:54.799
public schools by like trying to

00:57:54.799 --> 00:57:57.520
make them uh you know cool and stuff and

00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.400
dude it's

00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.200
yeah it's very interesting so until you

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.480
find out how they actually ruined this

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.680
oh because it sounds like they just made

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.359
it bro

00:58:05.359 --> 00:58:06.880
this is how it gets very weird so that

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.359
was in 2015 right now the lady goes back

00:58:09.359 --> 00:58:10.480
to the school

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.760
so there's a there's like a nazi type

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.319
school

00:58:14.319 --> 00:58:17.680
kindergarten called success oh they beat

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.400
the [ __ ] out

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.680
they don't hit them but the kids are

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.599
like super disciplined

00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:24.079
and the and here's what she's excited

00:58:24.079 --> 00:58:25.520
about is the white parents have zero

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.160
power

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.000
everybody's treated the exact same but

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.280
then she gets upset that

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.720
people of color are being disciplined by

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.720
white people so

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.559
that's that's her that's something she's

00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:35.760
got to work on

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.119
personally that's right that if she

00:58:37.119 --> 00:58:38.799
can't see that and get upset

00:58:38.799 --> 00:58:41.839
she needs something the odd you know

00:58:41.839 --> 00:58:43.599
the podcaster needs to work on something

00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:45.280
they should just balance it out by

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.640
throughout the day just showing them

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.720
clips of like jamaican daycare workers

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.920
beating the [ __ ] out of white children

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:54.319
there's a no all right this is this is

00:58:54.319 --> 00:58:55.920
where it gets crazy so upstairs

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.760
all they're upset they're obsessed with

00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.520
race at this school

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:03.680
so obsessed that they have a like squad

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.079
that goes door to door to look for

00:59:06.079 --> 00:59:07.839
racism in the classrooms

00:59:07.839 --> 00:59:10.240
so like people walk by with clipboards

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.319
and just peer into your classroom

00:59:12.319 --> 00:59:14.559
and see if they find any racism and then

00:59:14.559 --> 00:59:16.079
they all these adults that are going

00:59:16.079 --> 00:59:17.680
around classroom to classroom to look

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.720
for racism in

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:21.520
kids adults are doing this yes these are

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:22.400
the adults

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.000
this is like a committee of adults

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.599
looking for

00:59:25.599 --> 00:59:27.920
third graders being racist to each other

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.440
and then they all go back together and

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.799
report what they found this one lady was

00:59:30.799 --> 00:59:31.280
like

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:33.760
there were groups of three and the black

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:34.400
boy

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.640
got the answer first and the white girl

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.640
looked to the white boy first

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.319
to see if she should go with the black

00:59:40.319 --> 00:59:42.160
student's answer now

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.880
this could be that she trusts the white

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.720
student or that the black student

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.280
could be wrong sometimes or does she not

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.000
see him as a human being at all

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.680

01:01:38.799 --> 01:01:40.160
this was like fifth

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.359
so yeah that sounds about right i had it

01:01:41.359 --> 01:01:44.160
you know there's school yeah that's cool

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.160
it's a bryn mawr i had a ruler i didn't

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.280
know what they were i knew that i knew

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.160
like people were like yo

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.280
they're really bad to draw those i was

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.359
like yeah give me those yeah all right

01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:53.440
ten more few more and i should beat kids

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.039
i should just

01:01:55.039 --> 01:01:59.200
swap i talked about this before yeah

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.200
it wasn't the uh like so you were like a

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.640
teacher at success it was a

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.400
it was a geometry ruler too so it was

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.079
three sided so it was like a club

01:02:06.079 --> 01:02:07.359
it's one of those ones you could do and

01:02:07.359 --> 01:02:09.280
it was just like it said like [ __ ]

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.799
[ __ ] then it would have like swastikas

01:02:10.799 --> 01:02:11.920
and i would just turn around the teacher

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.039
turn around just beat the [ __ ] out of

01:02:13.039 --> 01:02:14.799
the gate

01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:16.240
that'd be nice if you get one embedded

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.400
on a kid

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.000
it was all permanent that'd be funny too

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.160
if that happened now and a teacher was

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.440
like holy [ __ ] i actually

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.599

01:02:27.599 --> 01:02:29.680
god my second graders are nazis

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.240
yeah speaking of nazis i watched

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.000
greyhound last night

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.039

course world war ii yeah

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.720
why does dom hanks and steven spielberg

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.920

okay saving private ryan captain

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.559
phillips captain phillips

01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:02.960
tom hanks on a boat in adversity is

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.599
pretty good

01:03:03.599 --> 01:03:05.119
i'll give him that but they always

01:03:05.119 --> 01:03:07.839
there's the same music for world war ii

01:03:07.839 --> 01:03:10.319
that they basically now when you think

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:11.760
of world war ii you think of this music

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.039
it's like horns

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:14.880
like slow like i was just playing

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.200
glorious uplifting horns

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.319
and then like a god-fearing reluctant

01:03:20.319 --> 01:03:21.760
hero that doesn't really want to be

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.359
there that's

01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:25.520
a great man like they made they went out

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.119
of their way for him to be like boys

01:03:27.119 --> 01:03:29.359
with the black chef

01:03:29.359 --> 01:03:32.480
it's a white captain on a submarine

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.039
hunting

01:03:33.039 --> 01:03:34.240
vessel in the north atlantic and the

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.520
black chef would come up and they'd pray

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.480
together

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.119
and it's like dude

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.680
get out like we now he's not even

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.640
allowed to be racist

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.440
this guy this world war ii murderous

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.720
captain

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.160
still they have to show and be like look

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.480
how great he was it's weird dude i don't

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:50.799
know

01:03:50.799 --> 01:03:52.000
i know you reach that point in a lot of

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.760
movies where you get to the point where

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.880
the main character like

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.880
encounters like a woman or a person of

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.079
color and they're like by the way

01:03:58.079 --> 01:04:00.880
um my character feels better about you

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.160
than everyone else

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.760
it doesn't make sense yeah you know

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.680
that's the point of the movie yeah

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.920
well tom hanks has like been canonized

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.880
into that

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.280
he just portrays like elite liberal

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.440
values and he gets cred for that in real

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.119
life which is weird it's like how like

01:04:15.119 --> 01:04:17.520
john claude van damme is like a badass

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.440
or like even robert de niro's robert de

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.280
niro is the classic example yeah dude

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.480
him and al pacino were doing like

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.839
broadway musicals

01:04:23.839 --> 01:04:25.200
dude they're like no that guy's like a

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.400
mob boss he's like no he's not he's a

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.520
[ __ ] actor

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.799
he's a [ __ ] yeah they're like yeah that

01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:29.839
guy's tough you don't want a problem

01:04:29.839 --> 01:04:30.640
with him totally

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.319
like you would wail on that dude al

01:04:32.319 --> 01:04:34.400
pacino was doing one of those like gq

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.160
like epic interviews or like sit like

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.160
all in white in a weird thing

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.760
and it al pacino was like yeah remember

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.960
that rob we used to do those little

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.039
musicals and he's like

01:04:43.039 --> 01:04:44.240
and he like you could tell he was trying

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.160
to change the song remember those

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.280
yeah i might have popped a couple of

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.119
those few things a couple of there went

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:54.240
down there had a few pops

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.920
but yeah yeah that's weird how actors

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.520
get like movie cred like that carries

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:57.760
him

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.920
that follows him in real life yeah like

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.520
all right cut and then like tom hanks

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.720
and i was like a liberal hero

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.799
tom hanks hunted although it was making

01:05:04.799 --> 01:05:06.640
me laugh imagining underwater nazis for

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.319
some reason they're all in submarines

01:05:08.319 --> 01:05:09.680
just imagining a bunch of nazis and

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.200
submarines being like hi ho

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.920
are there any jews down here there

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.319
better not be

01:05:18.319 --> 01:05:20.960
and then they would uh the one captain

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.520
of the one would get on their radio on

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.200
the americans radio and just be like

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.079

01:05:28.079 --> 01:05:32.160
the gray wolf we will hunt you oh

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.839
and you'd be like turn that off god damn

01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:36.160
it i ended up like your joke cheering

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.839
for the nazis in this movie oh my god i

01:05:37.839 --> 01:05:39.599

ship and one of them was cleveland

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.440
depth charge really at the nazi sub and

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.839
they're like oh

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.599

01:06:35.599 --> 01:06:38.079
oh this water is disgusting now

01:06:38.079 --> 01:06:41.119

yeah the the whole like that interaction

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.799
it's kind of a short movie

01:06:54.799 --> 01:06:57.200
there's no real plot it's just the

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:57.839
battle

01:06:57.839 --> 01:07:00.240
but they infuse this in they also

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.839
infused him and his wife

01:07:01.839 --> 01:07:03.359
like the first like minute of the movie

01:07:03.359 --> 01:07:06.079
is him leaving so it's him being in love

01:07:06.079 --> 01:07:07.839
him him being like i love you so much

01:07:07.839 --> 01:07:08.880
you're the most important thing to me

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.680
and then it's just

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.480
a battle for an hour and a half and they

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:12.960
just

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.119
the wife's out the wife's pointless yeah

01:07:15.119 --> 01:07:16.480
it just shows you how he's

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.079
he loves him such a good man he's kind

01:07:18.079 --> 01:07:19.520
of hetero

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.720
he should have like [ __ ] a dude and

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.200
been like i'm out of here and then

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.680
cleveland comes up and keeps trying to

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.400
make him eat

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.799
he's like you gotta eat captain you

01:07:28.799 --> 01:07:30.480
gotta eat and for some reason just never

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.920
eats well he hates nazis but one of the

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.359
bullets does come through and blow up

01:07:33.359 --> 01:07:36.480
his bacon negative cheese

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.960
what happens if he keeps trying to make

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.240
breakfast sandwiches

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.079
and at one point a nazi bullet comes in

01:07:42.079 --> 01:07:44.079
and hits his breakfast sandwich

01:07:44.079 --> 01:07:48.000
makes me laugh so hard just a nazi like

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.240
like shooting it does nazis just the

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.119
underwater

01:07:53.119 --> 01:07:54.880
scope they're like what is it it's like

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.319
some sort of pork with

01:07:56.319 --> 01:07:59.119
cheese and egg on a delicious roll

01:07:59.119 --> 01:08:01.680
cleveland is delivering it

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.680
we will get him boys don't worry they

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.960
weren't even after the cargo ships

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.160
they're just trying to get cleveland

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.400
write that down they literally killed

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.920
three dudes on the entire ship one of

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.039
them was cleveland i wonder if they were

01:08:13.039 --> 01:08:14.880
like mission accomplished

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.839
from the waist down

01:09:25.839 --> 01:09:27.440
yeah i get it if you're like a dude who

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.120
was like because i knew a guy that was

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:29.600
like

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.080
a military guy that he like he was a

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.920
military guy in like the 90s so he like

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.480
served in south korea yeah he basically

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.400
did like vacation

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.080
yeah [ __ ] he did that they they like

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.520
went to germany and south korea and they

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.239
were like

01:09:42.239 --> 01:09:43.679
time in the army but then it like that's

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.759
your identity for the rest of your life

01:09:45.759 --> 01:09:46.080
yeah

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.159
it's like the eight years you basically

01:09:48.159 --> 01:09:49.600
studied abroad

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.120
yeah for sure you haven't he had an

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.400
anchor and he would just give him a [ __ ]

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.920
on those dudes no i got i support the

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.280
troops he rules for sure

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.800
i got caught up with some people over

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.400
this really yeah there was like a

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.239
veterans day or something like that or

01:10:00.239 --> 01:10:01.600
it wasn't memorial day it was veteran's

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.280
day and i was like shout out to all my

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:03.679
boys

01:10:03.679 --> 01:10:05.360
because i knew a bunch of dudes who

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.880
enlisted and then went to hawaii for

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.520
like four years

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.719
bullshitted around i was like shout out

01:10:08.719 --> 01:10:10.560
to my boys posted up and watched yeah

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.480
yeah which was fun games until the

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.679
japanese

01:10:13.679 --> 01:10:15.360
true in the 40s they thought that was

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.719
fun and games dude it's been pretty

01:10:16.719 --> 01:10:18.000
sweet ever since

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.760
true that's because the japanese got

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.679
what for for that dude nobody ruins

01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:23.360
party time in hawaii

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.120
so it's also funny to think about that

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.640
guy and then that movie where tom hanks

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.239
is on that guy's boat and being like

01:10:28.239 --> 01:10:31.040
hey come on be nice to the chef guys

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.719
he's like i met a [ __ ] and i [ __ ] her

01:10:32.719 --> 01:10:34.480
once and she was a mermaid she had a

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.360
[ __ ]

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.960
and that's now yeah imagine 1940s dude

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.800
this guy would have been like 1960s on a

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.000
boat he's not about

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.640
1940s on a boat you would have been

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.360
[ __ ] dude

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.880
nobody came first of all the whole time

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.480
so i'm not jerking off i was thinking

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.440
about that

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.560
i was thinking about that of course they

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.560
drove less people shut off i think yeah

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:52.960
before

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.800
not as open as with their sexuality yeah

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.560
for sure it was definitely hidden way

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.080
more and there's probably guys who were

01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.440
like i'm not [ __ ] jerking off i'm not

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.239
jerking off

01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:01.600
guys back then i thought that was like

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.280
you're going to hell for that i would i

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.239
i rarely jerk off if i'm on bunk beds to

01:11:06.239 --> 01:11:07.280
this day

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.440
oh for sure i've been caught out of my

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.400
life entirely

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.239
jerking off on punk beds you got some

01:11:12.239 --> 01:11:14.560
bunk beds in you don't you

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.800

though

01:11:21.199 --> 01:11:22.400
that's probably why i wanted him to eat

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.719
that food so bad he was pumping all over

01:11:24.719 --> 01:11:26.000

they never show you inside the saw

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.560
unfortunately because that would have

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.679
