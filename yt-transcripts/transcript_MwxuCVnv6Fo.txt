00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.240

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.680
did you i think so yeah just by being

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.680
we talked about on the patreon but yeah

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.039
i [ __ ] up sorry guys

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.720

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.160
things were going

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.239
yeah man i definitely triggered the nego

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.200
[ __ ] nest

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.360
within our patreon or our reddit just

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.960
like

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.640
nego [ __ ] are definitely fired up right

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.480
now yeah they are i feel bad

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.960
i feel bad because i i did i loused up

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.559
it's like my bad guys there's mistakes

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:45.840
made but it's like

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840
it reminds me of being back in bryn mawr

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.360
when it's like you get these guys have

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.199
these strong emotional reactions at the

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.199
drop of a hat with like no nuance or

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:53.760
there's like

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.480
this is what's happening yeah you know

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.360
it's a shame

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.640
so basically you're calling the nego

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.879
[ __ ] libtards

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.879
they're sort of they stay they share

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.400
qualities they do share qualities

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.840
they're not gonna like the reddit boys

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.439
are a liberal partner at all

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.080
no it's it's a type of thinking that you

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.360
just put any kind of filter on when

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.520
something happens you're just like

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.119
yeah it's like take dude take a breath

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.880
it's so funny that it's hard for me not

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.200
to want to make you dig a deeper hole

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.479
i know like there's a part of me that

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.080
wants to just be like why did you do

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.720
that

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.640
just to be a [ __ ] just to be an

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.000
[ __ ] but i understand

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.640
that the position you're in is shitty

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.640
when the nego [ __ ] on reddit turn on you

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.040
it

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.200
sucks sucks because normally normally

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.520
you open reddit you're like oh nice

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.159
like here's a funny quote this guy rules

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.439
especially with you they're always like

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.680
all the shaman [ __ ] sick

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.079
shane's a fat [ __ ] shaman rules well

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.600
if you're doing what they want you're

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.399
the best oh yeah

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.920
they share you with praise as soon as

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.759
they don't like something they're like

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.200
their brain is just like oh my god the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.840

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.400
it is it's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.599

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.879
i said this yesterday too on the patreon

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:55.920
but it's like the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.599
following the shop thing like shaw will

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.440
get hit with negotiating dude you might

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.000
be

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
i'm telling you it's true but he'll

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.599
he'll hit it and he'll negotiate back

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.000
where he's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.159
like you guys are losers like i go on

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.159
this thing and i genuinely

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.080
it's like a broiling pit of just human

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.360

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.800
just like sad and angry yeah

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.959
that's more of what i i think's like the

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.560
the shitty part of it's not like

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.159

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.800
whatever but it's like

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.360

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.040

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.000
a little

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.520

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:38.720
individual i'm dealing with

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.560
you know i made mistakes he made

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.000
mistakes i didn't want to hang the guy

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.319
out

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:44.479
that to me is the weakest personal thing

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:46.000
to have a mob full of people who are

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.840
just like

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.639
out for pure hatred and then like take

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:52.160
like i can't punch his pilot this man

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.960

can't bring myself

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.280

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.280

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.960
it was like only we need to release the

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.720

no i do uh it's a very weird conflicting

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.639
thing because the funniest part is you

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:32.080
can just delete a reddit app and it like

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.760
just stops it doesn't it's gone like it

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.120
doesn't affect anything yeah of course

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.680
but you turn

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.959
open it up you're like i have to fix

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:39.680
this and it's an unfixable situation

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.919
but you know i think it's fixable i

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.200
think everybody will

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.200
i think i mean we'll forgive you dude

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.560

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.959
yeah but dude i hate hell dog dude in

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:50.380

would tear up it's okay it's okay

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.800
yeah let's move on let's move on from

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.480
the reddit yeah we should

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.080
because normal people are driving their

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.320
cars thinking the [ __ ] are these two

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.920
weird dudes into now

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.800
no it's true it's uh it's wicked it's

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.440
pretty wicked

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.200
now that was the so dude last night i

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.720
had so i'm laying there

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.640
i i had no sleepless not over this [ __ ]

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.800
my dad my baby woke up at like

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.720
four in the morning it woke up at 12 at

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.640
night two and then four

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.000
so i wake up at four and i'm like i'm

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.240
just up and then i had like this flash

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.160
of insight exactly how i'm going to do

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.839
psychnol now which i was like

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:29.600
[ __ ] sick dude that was actually kind

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.600
of it was kind of nice dude that is nice

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.000
yeah so the the thing i'm going to do

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.040
and you know this is the thing i've been

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.720
working on for a while

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.640
is take so there's this whole idea of

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.160
psychological flexibility which

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.600
they've studied like a bunch of

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.040
disciplines a bunch of therapies and

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.600
like

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.279
this seems to be one of the underlying

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:46.720
processes that like

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.640
makes people feel better and they've

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.760
studied it you know it's not like you

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.600
know you go you pay you talk you hope it

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.560
works they're like

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.839
this is you know the whole thing breaks

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:55.600
down into like these six points where

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.560
it's like

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.160
um so there's parts that are your

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.440
behavior parts that are the way you

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.000
think

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.920
so there's psychological flexibility

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.920
makes up these i think six things but

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.720
it's like

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.240
contact with the present moment being

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.600
able to actually sit in the present

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.120
moment without your brain like being

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.519
like

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:10.800
what are you doing this is boring this

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.399
sucks this blah blah blah being able to

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.360
sit in a moment

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.240
and not worry so you have there's that

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.440
um i'll move for one

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.519
but you can't sit in the present moment

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:20.880
people who can't sit in the present

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.079
moment without being like

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:23.680
what's about to happen was really we're

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.279
two dudes sitting in a chair yeah

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.880
but we're also our brains are coming up

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.399
with these scenarios of like possible

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:30.000
dangers that could happen like you know

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.240
this could suck this could be boring you

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.120
know so that's

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.200
exactly so that's one thing that pops up

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.320
but if you do that

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.760
in your life when you're just like doing

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.040
other things that can cause problems

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.079
that don't need to exist

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:41.760
yeah so really it's like being in touch

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.519
with the present moment being able to

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:44.880
mindfully handle

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.320
things that could be psychologically

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.000
painful like you know you don't want to

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.120
just if some guy comes into your room

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.399
and starts like fingering your butthole

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.600
they're not saying like hey dude it's

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.720
mind over matter

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.720
it's not like that but if you were like

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.240
say like you know some dude was like i'm

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.040
gonna come in there and finger your

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.519
[ __ ] dude

00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:00.079
that's that's happened a lot of women

00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:01.519
what some dudes come in and finger their

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:02.000
butthole

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.720
yeah oh yeah i was watching uh there's a

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.600
whole show on

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.720
this guy named the east area rapist it's

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.000
patton oswalt's wife

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.720
wrote a book she like solved this guy's

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.760
she caught this guy

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.600
why it was a cold case she wrote a

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.600
[ __ ] murder mystery about him

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.120
like a fat you know factual obviously it

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.200
wasn't and caught him but there was one

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:21.519
guy

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:23.360
there was a bunch of rapists back then

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.760
in the 70s like serial rapists

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.760
like that was a common thing they were

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.880
just out and about there were dudes that

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.399
were like prowling neighborhoods

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.399
and like breaking into houses like

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.760
getting women what

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.200
yeah i guess i don't know this guy did

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.120
it constantly but there was one dude

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.959
known as the stinky rapist

00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:40.560
which that was making me laugh they all

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.000
had nicknames all the rapists had

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.760
names he was but he was just one of them

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.000
was the stinky rapist

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.800
and it was because he smelled so bad oh

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.120
and

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.040
uh i thought that was a great nickname

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.560
for

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.079
it's like the stinky cheese man just

00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:55.760
being a stinky rapist like you know how

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.720
bad you have to smell it

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.360
while you're raping someone then be like

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.000
true

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.240
yeah although i think your heightens get

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.920
sent your senses get height like you'll

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.360
like you'll remember like

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.959
but yeah that's pretty because you'd

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:09.120
think they'd be focused on the

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.680
you know the horrific atrocities but

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.120
then they're like god dude this guy

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.160
[ __ ] stopped

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.680
sting and everybody reported that uh

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.519
the east area rapist had a small dick

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:20.880
like every single person was like the

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.120
only things i remember about him was

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.160
a pretty small dick yeah

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.040
anyway that's kind of hor that's like

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.800
that's terrifying so she solved these

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.519
things

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:34.560
she did actually and then she died she

gun in my head at the same time yeah

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.760
especially with the teenagers the guy's

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.320

true i don't know i hear you but you

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.320

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:13.279
dick out standing in front of you with a

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:13.920
knife

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.160
i think about this all the time i'm like

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.440
whenever

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.519
i'm laying in bed and waking up i'm

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:20.880
constantly being like

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.800
if there was a guy in my house like how

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.720
quick could i react and i have to i like

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.920
whenever i sleep especially if i'm by

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.920
myself i'll have to like come to peace

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.959
to the situation like

00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:30.639
there fully could be a guy in my house

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:32.399
and i'll i think i trust myself to pop

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:33.839
up nick i kind of have this weird desire

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:34.480
to

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.079
fight you guys in that situation and

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:37.680
fight my way out of it

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.079
i thought i did go for that i've talked

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.360
to you i've been the time i had sleep

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.360
for houses yeah exactly ass naked

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.440
yeah came out swinging [ __ ] i had to

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.480
swing i'm

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.480
swinging in the dark dude all right

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.240
sorry to interrupt the uh

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.600
so we got number two was so present

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.880
moment getting fingered in the ass

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.040
present moment and then there's uh yeah

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.560
being able to have be in touch with the

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.920
present moment being able to accept

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.519
painful material that pops up like you

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:02.880
were sitting there and being like

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.880
you know like i'm a [ __ ] loser you're

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.160
you're at a quick matrix point where

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.519
they're either going to let that dictate

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:09.760
your next behalf move like your behavior

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.360
or you can sit there and be like this is

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.880
just a thought my brain's producing and

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.519
then

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:14.800
the other so that's like being able to

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.920
sit with stuff that's kind of painful

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.279
without actually having that dictate

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:18.320
your behavior yeah

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.360
because typically when you're trying to

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.959
mitigate psychological pain you do a

00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:21.920
quick maneuver

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.399
just to get rid of it that usually kind

00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:25.920
of makes your life smaller and smaller

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.639
because you're trying to just

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:28.000
once you deem a thing a threat your

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.680
brain naturally starts to avoid it

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.279
so the idea is so you have you're able

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:33.360
to be contact the present moment

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.680
be mindful of painful situations or you

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.959
know thoughts or whatever

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:38.639
and then the other parts the behavioral

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:40.240
part where you have a set of like values

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.759
or things that you actually want in your

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:42.320
life

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.279
and then when you get to the point

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:44.560
you're able to sit there and diffuse

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.839
yourself from your thought

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:47.279
and then move towards the thing that you

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.720
actually want rather than limiting your

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.920
life through just trying to mitigate

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.120
psychological stuff

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.959
that's not real and you know in a sense

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:54.240
that it's not actually affecting your

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.040
life because

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.240
if you were contacting the present

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.279
moment you would know that you're just

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:58.560
kind of like sitting in a chair

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.240
about to eat dinner but you can see like

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.160
dude like i'm harping on the reddit

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.440
stuff but you could sit there

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.199
and imagine these dystopian futures

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:07.600
where you're like everyone's gonna leave

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.800
and you can start acting out of this

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.000
thing that hasn't happened and doesn't

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.279
exist in the present moment or you can

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.399
just sit in the present moment and be

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:13.040
like all right

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.160
how do i actually think what do i

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.440
actually value and move towards that

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.120
despite feeling a certain way

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.639
so that's that's this guy studied it and

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:20.160
like came up with a like a system

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160
yeah so i'm gonna i have it like a

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.440
module where it's set up where people

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.720
i'm gonna have three levels to it where

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.839
people can just do it

00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:27.120
just with like their friends like here's

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.399
the module you can just like talk about

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:29.519
the stuff and you know try to

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:31.360
like put the ideas in your life the

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.360
second one would be more like um or

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.480
the first one would be people to take

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.680
the test to see how they rate on

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.959
psychological flexibility

00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:38.959
who don't do any of it like a like a

00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:41.040
control group and then they can come in

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.320
like six months later and make how's

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.079
your psychological flexibility second

00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:45.839
one's a peer group just peers no like

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:46.320
you know

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.680
super guidance and then you see like

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.920
before and after six months and then do

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.360
pre and post tests for people who

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.199
actually win like a structured group

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:54.560
and then take all that data and see like

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.160
if the whole thing i'm trying to figure

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.079
out is if you actually need

00:16:58.079 --> 00:16:59.920
a therapist or if people can with the

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.199
information do

00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:02.639
something comfortable by themselves so

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:04.240
that people can have free therapy

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.400
and not have to have the option exist

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.000
yeah so that's what i'm all right that's

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.679
what i'm working on right now

00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:11.360
that's tight which i'm working on right

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.760
now so that's the goal that's the goal

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.520
right now and i hope you know

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.799
i'm just hoping that it doesn't get

people to kind of like you know just use

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.360
the internet for a thing that actually

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.799
feels so you're trying to help the

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:32.720
mental stability of the reddit boys who

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.120

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.160
jane goodall getting ripped apart by age

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.440

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.840

heart's in the right place man it's just

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:49.280
you know

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.799
my heart's too big your heart's too big

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:53.120
it just gets kicked and punched all over

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.000
oh man but no i was actually excited so

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.520
i figured out finally how to do it where

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.120
i'm just gonna release the thing

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.320
i'm going to actually i want to do a

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.799
thing where i do mock therapy sessions

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:04.080
with comedians where you can just make

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.280
up fictitious things and

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.880
go through it so people can watch and

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.960
see how like you know a group is but you

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.840
would have do it like

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.919
obviously like an entertaining way so

00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:13.679
pretty fun let's just get people

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:14.799
out because they do when you go to

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:16.720
school for this they have mock therapy

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.720
sessions that they're so [ __ ] funny

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.000
what type of things do they talk about

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.679
it's just a guy being like it's like

00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:23.039
they'll have a therapist trying to show

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:23.919
people like

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:25.039
in trainings of like you know we'll do

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:27.200
like a fake therapy session and it'll be

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.000
a guy like

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.520
another like therapist or a therapist in

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.440
training acting bad be like i just can't

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.559
stand my wife

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:34.480
she gained weight she doesn't do nothing

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.000
around the house dude

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.880
most basic [ __ ] psychology possible

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.080
yeah

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.080
it's pretty funny but yeah so that

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.080
that's that was my uh

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.840
that was last night i was like it all it

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.799
all clicked and i was like it all

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:48.160
clicked thank you that's nice

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.080
it's nice when a plan comes together

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.840
exactly so

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.000
but yeah man so that was the uh dude it

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.840
really is crazy to think about how much

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.679
people freak themselves out over a thing

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:58.559
that's not

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:01.440
physically like a biological threat or

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.080
something that's

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.240
actually in their life it's like people

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.440
spend a good portion of their life

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.080
trying to keep

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.160
almost like mental ghosts at bay that if

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.440
they were just to turn instead of trying

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.360
to fight them just accept them be like

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.720
yeah that is something about me that

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.080
kind of sucks and be like it's all right

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.360
buddy come here you bring yourself all

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.480
in together and you stop trying to

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.000
control the little things

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.440
you know and you can just move towards

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.559
you just think of what you actually want

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:21.919
to do and just go do that

00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:22.960
because you're going to feel shitty no

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.640
matter what but if you try to control

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.600
how shitty you feel

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.360
yeah you'll just you'll definitely feel

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.960
more shittier because you'll never get

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.240
to do the things you kind of want to do

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.400
so pretty sick yeah i've learned to kind

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.919
of power through feeling shitty

00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:36.400
yeah you just do whatever i yeah ice

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.240
dude i used to [ __ ] quit things so

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.880
hard i would feel shitty and be like

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.559
my i would concoct this whole thing

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:44.640
where i'm like this clearly isn't for me

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.320
i gotta get out of it

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.840
oh yeah i can quit the [ __ ] out of

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.600
things i mean some things are good

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.799
that's the other thing

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:52.400
some things are genuinely good like you

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.080
know like i was definitely in a marriage

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.880
that

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.480
wasn't working for me overall that was

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.840
like that was something i quit that i

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.600
was gonna throw that under the bus too

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.919
what my first marriage that was

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:03.360
genuinely my fault too dude

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.720
again that was another thing you were

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.919
talking about like pre-imagined

00:20:05.919 --> 00:20:07.600
situations it would be like

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.440
not have sex for three days and i'm like

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.080
i'm gonna be [ __ ] celibate oh my god

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.240
you start being like you you imagine if

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.240
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] brad is the gay

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:16.799
[ __ ]

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.720
on earth it's on it's on dude i was in

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.840
that too and the

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.440
relationship i was in i was just like we

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.120
never even have sex

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.960
it's like dude why would she i was

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.320
sitting there [ __ ]

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.760
just laying there playing video games

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.440
she i didn't have a job

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.200
[Laughter]

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.919
good lord yeah man i dude i did it i

00:20:33.919 --> 00:20:35.440
shudder to think about that too

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.159
yes the fact of like same thing i was

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:39.760
just lousing around when's the last time

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.039
she even gave me head

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:43.760
exactly dude dude i would like fart to

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.679
the point where she was wretching in bed

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:48.799
be like we never have sex i would never

00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:50.400
do anything i would go we'd go out to a

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.600
nice dinner and i'd

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.720
i had this thing where like i would

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.799
finally get the bill and like if

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:56.480
if we like argued at all i'd instantly

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.400
be like why the [ __ ] do we even go out

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.360
and do anything there so

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.559
if we went out somewhere nice i would

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:01.919
instantly complain about how much it

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:02.400
costs

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.520
after doing it so it would just

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.280
completely yeah yeah if you take a girl

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.880
to a nice dinner and you're like

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.000
we have to tighten our belts a little

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.200
bit after that you're just not getting a

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.000
[ __ ]

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.039
yeah yeah yeah you're like i mean i hope

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.080
you're happy with that because i just

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.200
have a stomachache i don't see why

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.000
people pay all that money

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.440
for expensive dinners because they just

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.960
use too much butter it's the food's too

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.159
rich i'm not used and she would just be

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:21.600
like i'm not sucking this guy's dick

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.640
yeah of course how could you yeah man

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.480
damn but yeah it sucks to just think

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.720
about the queen you know

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.440
my bae yep former babies i let go by

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.240
being a fat

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.320
[ __ ] just laying around well it didn't

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.159
that was the thing i would sit there and

00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:37.360
you know i could sit there there's a

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.039
bunch of you can there's like bad stuff

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:40.320
i could put on that person

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.080
of course of course but it's like you

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.559
know in reality it always takes two to

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:45.600
tango first of all

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.799
and i mean for sure and then it's like

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:50.960
i would sit there and be like in my head

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.919
you know i'm sitting there

00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:54.159
i'm just a dude who like probably could

00:21:54.159 --> 00:21:55.679
just jerk off and forget about this or

00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:57.200
just like you know figure out ways to

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.159
like cultivate

00:21:58.159 --> 00:21:59.520
sex in a marriage but i would just sit

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.440
there in my head i'm in the

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.840
i'm in this imagined scenario where i

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.960
just like become

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.440
involuntarily celibate in a relationship

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.600
and then act as if that's the reality

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.640
i'm inhabiting

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.240
yeah which are the i start taking these

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.240
wild drastic actions that just [ __ ]

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.919
stuff up more because it's not based in

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:16.640
reality

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.919
the other person is just looking at you

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:21.120
like what's going on you're like

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.640
and you can't explain it because you're

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.159
literally not acting in

00:22:24.159 --> 00:22:25.679
the reality around you and you're also

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:27.520
not like talking to the other person

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.120
having them like here's how i'm feeling

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.960
you're just being like

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.280
you [ __ ] never have to yeah you used

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.480
to [ __ ] me

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.600
yeah god but that you do that in your

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.480
life in like

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.480
millions of different arenas so it's

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.400
like you know unless people can that's

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.840
there's an idea where you can have

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.679
thoughts and you take them as reality

00:22:45.679 --> 00:22:46.960
and even a self story you can have a

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.919
thing where you're like

00:22:47.919 --> 00:22:50.080
i'm a nice guy so then you do things

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.120
that aren't nice

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.960
and then you have to do i'm like real

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.840
nice

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.360
you do things then when you do things

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.960
that aren't nice you have this thing

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.480
where you deny that you actually did

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.320
them and you have to concoct things that

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.039
like at the end of the orchestra

00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:08.320
of just pence getting caught with a

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.000
bunch of like hot young boys and meth

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.640

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.159
vice president yeah

i've never met i mean is has there been

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.520
a better vice president he

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.200
he is like you know the cardboard

that i think he's two-dimensional i

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:36.240
think if he were to push pence he would

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:36.960

djt will be like all right pence like i

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.679

00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:50.400
kind of okay or if someone asks you like

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.440

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.960
pence is going to handle like the hard

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.260
technical medical questions

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.240
just call someone a wagon

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:42.960

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.200

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.800

00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:17.280
mindfulness of like doing yoga in the

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.599
park and then like my neighbors come by

00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:23.119
and i was [ __ ] like

00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:24.400
that's another thing too that's selfless

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.400
context you're like i'm not a person who

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.680
takes my shirt off in the park even

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.560
though

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.400
you know again i have bit ships but it's

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.839
nice you don't have [ __ ] getting

00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:32.560
sunlight

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.079
getting getting sunlight on your entire

00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:37.760
body while doing yoga in the park isn't

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.599
nice you don't have to sit nice

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:41.440
they're going down dude i broke my dr

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.880
broke my pr nice

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.200
how fast did you run huh how fast how

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.880
far excuse me mile and a half

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.000
that's [ __ ] sick a mile and a half 15

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.520
minutes dude

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.520
nah that was terrible hey come on man oh

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.440
yeah i forgot like

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.839
i can beat you in running no dude we're

00:37:57.839 --> 00:37:59.440
actually we should have a long distance

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.480
race we were doing

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.200
no for real my cardio sucks like we are

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.800
we're definitely we're comparable we're

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.400
neck and neck i beat you with the

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.320
the one thing we did i'm not good at

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.640
running dude it's crappy

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.240
well you started restricting my activity

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.359
i started going too well you were

00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:14.320
cheating on the

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.680
cheating on the app yeah you were you

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.520
were running when it says not to that's

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.960
dude if i can run when it says not to

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.920
that's just no you just run

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.320
harder when he says to run i'll do that

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.440
too

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.480
look you lost just let it go [ __ ] get

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:32.800
this [ __ ] dude

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.400
but yeah man that's that was like i was

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.000
doing it i'm like it's nice to get

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.440
sunlight is really good for you to get

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.720
like i think you need to they say in

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.520
order to not be

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.040
vitamin d deficient you need to have

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.280
like i don't know exactly what it is but

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.320
it's like sixty percent

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.760
i haven't you think so yeah oh man that

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.320
sucks

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.000
do you know it's just from cigarettes

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.520
really yeah cove

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.880
apparently cigarettes help from coved

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.440
they say someone said that i don't know

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.640
they were basically like people who

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.640
smoke were less likely to have yeah

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.160
they've literally yeah i think they said

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.920
people who smoke more likely

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.760
definitely more likely to die oh think

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.040
yeah definitely

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.880
oh then covet doesn't hit like those

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.400
black lungs you see in health class and

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.440
it's like whoa whoa whoa

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.040
yeah scary around here let's get out of

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.640
here

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.000
cover just got it's just like a dude

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.520
standing up for fatality and the kovitz

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.400
just like

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.240
punk yeah it's kind of a nice easy one

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.079
yeah but the uh

00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:21.440
but yeah man that was that was

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.960
definitely nice just doing that and

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.680
again just

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.040
being in a state where it's like because

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.640
you have to do the home too so in the

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.520
beginning you're like

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.720
oh which again dude i can't love

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.280
i can't even do that by myself it's so

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.640
funny when i do

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.839
fat guy yo going no no why

00:39:37.839 --> 00:39:39.920
i i just don't like it that's that's

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.680
fusion with selfish context dude

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.119
what is exactly what's the thought i

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:46.320
mean you might don't know exactly

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.599
generally might not like it you

00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:48.720
generally that's what i mean

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.800
but why so i think i genuinely don't

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.160
like it i i

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.000
the thing is to sit with a bunch of

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.160
people and all make noise at once

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.400
i think is it is usually fun i agree it

00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.599
well i think i think it's something a

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:01.040
part of being champion's rule

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.040
exactly something that's instinctually

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.359
gratifying to sit in unison either with

00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:06.000
a drum

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.359
if we're all sat there and we're having

00:40:07.359 --> 00:40:08.640
right now if we all had bongos and we're

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.319
drumming we'd be having a blast

00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:11.760
but the thought enters that's kind of

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.440
like it's kind of gay

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.280
and then you're like yeah yeah yeah but

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.960
it's a genuinely it's a grounding thing

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.240
if you take a group of people

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.319
and make them kind of talk sing or move

00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:22.240
in unison it instantly

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.079
like brings people together as a unit

00:40:24.079 --> 00:40:25.680
it's pretty crazy

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.599
no this one but but again it's one of

00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:28.640
those things where again you're in the

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.440
park you're going oh

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.640
i'm loving it i'm sitting there being

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.319
like oh my god dude my voice is blending

00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:35.599
with all the other i think it's the best

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:36.400
thing in the world

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.599
but it's like just sit and there's a

00:40:37.599 --> 00:40:39.680
thought of like jesus christ i hope my

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.160
neighbors don't walk by and see me

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.640
which again is like why would you let

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.760
that thing dictate

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.960
thing you know what i mean like why

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.319
would that thing dictate the thing you

00:40:48.319 --> 00:40:49.280
actually like to do

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.200
and how much of it does that dictate the

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.880
things that you might you might again

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.839
it's not saying everyone

00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:55.599
has to do the things that i'm into but

00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:57.440
what are things you're inherently into

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.119
that you maybe don't do because there's

00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:01.040
like these little like electrical fences

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.800
around certain scenarios

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.640
so yeah yeah like bill

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.390
like wants to kiss guys

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:11.040
[Laughter]

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.880
but he knows he knows it's not good

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.400
it will be perceived poorly by the

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.640
community true

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:19.839
i don't know bill could come out as a

00:41:19.839 --> 00:41:22.720
strong gay alt-right leader they do well

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.560
yeah they do pretty well they would if

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.319
you're gay and all right there's douglas

00:41:26.319 --> 00:41:26.880
mary

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.160
did pretty well milo milo tim dillon

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.200
td dude did you see the uh

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.520
speaking of uh the new age online

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.040
celebrity dude did you see

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.640
schultz's latest thing where he did uh

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.560
the thing about like donald trump not

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.480
going after jalen maxwell

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.040
oh no i didn't watch it dude so i'm

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.640
watching it and uh

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.200
i you know this is just my my theory but

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.560
i think that

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.640
hollywood now is transforming into

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.160
people who are anti-hot the new

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.359
hollywood's gonna be people who are

00:41:57.359 --> 00:41:58.480
anti-hollywood

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.680
and it's gonna i think colin schultz

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.319
hollywood he's new i think he's gonna be

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:03.599
hollywood two-point because you're

00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:05.200
i was watching him do his thing and

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.480
there's a lot a lot of times it's like

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.040
you know

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.640
he does have that like strong very kind

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.400
of celebrity persona so instantly as

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.839
people be like oh [ __ ] this

00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:12.960
i'm watching that just being like what

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.480
the [ __ ] is this saying i was like this

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.920
is pretty [ __ ] funny it was here yeah

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.240
yeah

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.319
doing uh calling you know calling out

00:42:18.319 --> 00:42:19.680
like just like trump for not

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.119
making fun of julian maxwell but i was

00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:22.960
just more so following the vibe of the

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.079
thing where it's like

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:25.920
this this is a guy with a pretty decent

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.119
sizeable following

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:29.200
who is sitting there being like kind of

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.800
you know saying a lot of stuff you said

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.920
like through trump's but he used to be

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.160
the man he's saying all this [ __ ]

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.839
and why is he you know kind of putting

00:42:35.839 --> 00:42:37.119
his tail between why isn't he going

00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:39.040
after just lane he you know

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.960
but i'm watching that i did see that i

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.160
was kind of laughing i was like dude

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.119
this was i was like

00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:44.960
i was i opened it up being just kind of

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.319
like lego [ __ ] just being like

00:42:46.319 --> 00:42:47.920
what's this and i watched it i was like

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.599
that's actually kind of funny yeah

00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:51.200
schultz's videos are really good yeah

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.599
man i was watching it just being like

00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:55.119
i think and i'm just you know i'm

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:57.760
thinking vibes i'm like this will be

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.400
in my opinion this is going to be the

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.079
new paradigm of hollywood

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:04.319
and i think all of this cancel culture

00:43:04.319 --> 00:43:05.440
stuff in about

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.160
i'll say three to four years will melt

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.280
away because i think there's

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.359
money money is getting closer to being

00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:12.400
like

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.240
oh okay let's just do this stuff now

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.319
we'll see yeah i think so man

00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:18.400
i think i was watching him do that and i

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.319
was like it's well produced it's very

00:43:20.319 --> 00:43:21.040
funny

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.240
yeah and it's i was like it's not

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.960
doing it has mass appeal without bending

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.839
to

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:30.720
the current like yeah popular regime

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.839
yeah all of his

00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:33.359
every one of those videos so far has

00:43:33.359 --> 00:43:35.200
been very good yeah

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.720
it was pretty it was pretty decent which

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.760
is funny because then you watch his

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.200
podcast and it's like man what the [ __ ]

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.160
is up with those shoes

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.960
y'all it's like wait where's that guy

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.240
and then you watch these videos it's

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.839
like the most poignant

00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:47.370
well thought out funny video

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.280
[Laughter]

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.680
i know but yeah man i'm telling you he's

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.160
uh well the funny thing too is like

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.319
like if you pay attention to pop culture

00:43:56.319 --> 00:43:57.920
that becomes the actual

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.640
like so like pop culture is just like

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.920
the training wheels of like you know

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.359
when people are like 20 years old what's

00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:04.560
cool for 20 year olds

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.240
eventually bleeds into discourse once

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.000
they're 45 and 50 years old and like you

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.280
know being in positions like run the

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.160
country

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.680
so it's like i'll be curious when you

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.680
know because this is like

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.920
like when people who are like 18 now or

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:16.960
45 i'm

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.040
it's gonna be [ __ ] crazy dude yeah

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.319
like looking about the [ __ ] they're into

00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:21.599
and stuff they're gonna like

00:44:21.599 --> 00:44:22.880
it's everything it is everything is

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.720
moving to the internet i've like i i

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.200
can't

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.520
well of course yeah i mean that's not

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.200
even

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.240
a debate yeah like what from like tv or

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:32.800
movies

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.359
yeah that shit's it's already gone

00:44:35.359 --> 00:44:36.160
exactly so

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.000
for sure yeah it's it's just kind of

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.760
crazy then it's like you know

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.359
although dude i'll say there's a channel

00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:43.280

00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:52.160
horrific

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.599
documentary about like it'll be about

00:44:53.599 --> 00:44:55.280
like a swiss lady who likes starved to

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.319
death

00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:58.480

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.640
dude i was i was watching it like holy

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.680
[ __ ] were they

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.440
were they good they're probably pretty

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.880
they were slamming dude they were

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.480
i mean dude if some like 24 year old

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.000
japanese prodigy would have eaten them

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.359
alive but like dude for like they were

00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:31.440
like 85 90 years old [ __ ] that's what it

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.800
is i was talking on the twitch

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.319
i was playing on beazer's twitch last

00:45:34.319 --> 00:45:35.359
night and somebody was asking what

00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:38.319

00:45:38.319 --> 00:45:40.319
baseball they're nasty at baseball yeah

00:45:40.319 --> 00:45:41.599
but i guess ping pong

00:45:41.599 --> 00:45:42.800
did they play i think that's more

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.720

ping-pong too dude

00:45:46.319 --> 00:45:49.119

let's [ __ ]

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.750
slice the ball in half

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:53.839
[Laughter]

00:45:53.839 --> 00:45:55.520

on this road wearing a black automatic

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:49.839
billboard

00:47:49.839 --> 00:47:52.720
and filmed it and dude everybody stopped

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.400
by and said something

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.040
every single car like i thought maybe

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.559
he'd get like a couple comments

00:47:58.559 --> 00:48:00.480
yeah dude everybody that drove by was

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.079
like

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:04.800
dude drive by me like well you're white

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.079
you [ __ ] stupid [ __ ]

00:48:06.079 --> 00:48:08.400
[ __ ] you it's just a white guy i guess

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.599
he was white yeah they yelled at him

00:48:09.599 --> 00:48:11.680
that he was white several times gotcha

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.760
they just everybody stopped and said

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.880
something

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.800
it was so [ __ ] funny kind of funny

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.079
actually it was really funny because

00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:19.680
these dudes were just really [ __ ]

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.800
like

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.079
they think they're trying to reason with

00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:23.440
they're like this is all [ __ ] dude

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.119
black lives matter is propaganda it's

00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:26.480
[ __ ] it would drive away and i was

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.000
like damn that's something i like

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.040
sometimes think get rid of that well

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:31.760
that's funny

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.880
but that dude might have been hitting

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.640
the truth maybe one of the dudes leaving

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.319
the walmart harassing a dude

00:48:36.319 --> 00:48:37.520
wearing a black lives matter shirt

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.760
didn't know what was up you know

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.520
what saying like it's propaganda yeah

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.839
yeah yeah yeah i mean

00:48:43.839 --> 00:48:46.800
dude the idea of hashtags are the

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.280
strange

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.880
how they bleed into discourse where it's

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.480
like hashtag this yeah and it's all of a

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.599
sudden like

00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:53.359
that's an idea that's like a worked out

00:48:53.359 --> 00:48:54.640
nuanced idea it's

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.240
there's no like debate it's just like

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.160
black lives matter and it's like

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.720
okay that's cool yeah what is the organ

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.079
so you can have that and it's

00:49:02.079 --> 00:49:04.000
like the [ __ ] pro-life [ __ ] it's like

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.200
you can have that it's like what is the

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.240
organization doing

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.280
yeah of course it's like where's the

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.880
money where's are you not pro-life it's

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.240
like no i'm definitely pro-life

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.400
well what's going on question the money

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.599
like where's the money you see [ __ ]

00:49:13.599 --> 00:49:15.040
about the money about like that was the

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.359
the vote blue or act blue thing yeah it

00:49:17.359 --> 00:49:19.280
was like there's a clause allegedly

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.800
again because we're in a disinformation

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.880
information of course but it's like

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.400
apparently there's a clause in that

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.160
organization where like if you use

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.319
act blue as your vehicle for moving

00:49:28.319 --> 00:49:30.720
money after x amount of days 60 days

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.079
it goes in so people were saying like

00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:33.359
they checked the donations and they or

00:49:33.359 --> 00:49:35.520
they even reported saying we got over

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.680
you know uh i don't know what it is just

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.040
say for the sake of easiness

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.079
10 million dollars in two days where

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.520
how did you allocate that 10 million

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.200
dollars and did you you allocated 10

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.040
million dollars within 60 days and if so

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.319
what did you spend that on

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:50.160
and the whole reason is that you can as

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.520
a you know the democrats you could have

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.079
that

00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:53.359
funneling money into it and it's like

00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:54.559
after 60 days it's like you know you

00:49:54.559 --> 00:49:56.000
spend you know pay a couple salaries

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.520
yeah what the [ __ ] did you do with 10

00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.520
million dollars and show us what you did

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.200
or did it go to the democratic party and

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.559
is the democratic party

00:50:02.559 --> 00:50:04.319
using that to funnel that's a legitimate

00:50:04.319 --> 00:50:06.160
question now imagine screaming that

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.680
driving past some dude holding a sign

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.160
it's so funny watching these dudes be

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.680
like hey mother

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:17.520
you're what driving away dude

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.559
it's so good i mean it's

00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:22.079
it and that's the other thing too you

00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:23.359
want to talk about people like again

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:24.960
you're driving some guy has a piece of

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.000
wood on him with words on

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.720
it and you drive and you go like yeah

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.079
you're wet and it's like

00:50:30.079 --> 00:50:32.319
again you're acting out of that's not

00:50:32.319 --> 00:50:34.079
present behavior you're acting out of a

00:50:34.079 --> 00:50:35.760
like a perceived nightmare in slightly

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:36.160
well

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.000
also think how hard these dudes have

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.280
been propagandized

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.800
yeah that they're sitting there they

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.200
[ __ ] crushed fox news all day

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.480
and then they're like holy [ __ ] it's

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.280
here true it's finally come down to

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.800
whatever town in arkansas they were in

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.440
yeah

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.119
that's gotta be like holy [ __ ] there's

00:50:51.119 --> 00:50:52.640

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.880
[Laughter]

oh god i said it yeah those uh but again

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:07.599
there's also

00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:09.680
there's also a very funny trend in this

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.079
country of filming [ __ ] white people

00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:13.599

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.240
[ __ ]

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.119
at a 7-11 and it's like

00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:22.720
but can't we say that's how the media

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.400
has been with black people and look how

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.359
aggressive they are

00:51:25.359 --> 00:51:28.720
i'm gonna sit back um yeah they did that

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.240
in the 90s for 10 years

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.640
yeah it wasn't great huh they still do

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.520
it now

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.480
where not like now now but like within

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.520
the past like

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.359
five years like black people have still

00:51:39.359 --> 00:51:40.960
been like

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.599
portrayed as aggressive black people

00:51:43.599 --> 00:51:44.880
portrayed as aggressive

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.960
yeah or have they been portrayed as too

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:50.800
weak in a feminism

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.440
which one do you believe it is i said

like they were trying to like emasculate

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.000
black men no

time i see like a video of like

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.640
a group of black dudes beating the [ __ ]

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.040
out of a white person it's usually like

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.720
i can't believe they said the n-word

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.800
you know yeah so usually like before

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.079
this video they said the animal

00:52:28.079 --> 00:52:29.920
like what an idiot they deserved this

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.119

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.400
well they this

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.520
is what i've seen well they flip a

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.520
switch in the 90s the news

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.520
was like just like they're doing like

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.880
you know they're always trying to

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.400
convince the population they're under

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.000
threat so like right now the news are

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.520
watching the demographics emerge and

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.559
they're being like

00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:47.839
all right before the news are just

00:52:47.839 --> 00:52:49.119
serving white people so white people are

00:52:49.119 --> 00:52:50.640
under threat from isis this net and

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.839
black people are committing crime

00:52:51.839 --> 00:52:53.359
especially in the early 90s because

00:52:53.359 --> 00:52:54.960
there was legitimately there was like

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.480
neighborhoods that were like completely

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.599
[ __ ] up and insane

00:52:57.599 --> 00:52:59.119
and you just ran clips and you're like

00:52:59.119 --> 00:53:00.079
black people are doing this black

00:53:00.079 --> 00:53:01.200
buildings you're scared of black people

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.319
be scared of black people

00:53:02.319 --> 00:53:03.760
and then now it's like they shifted the

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.119
winds and they're like oh wait the you

00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:06.800

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.240
formerly minority populations are

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.599
expanding so let's kind of serve them

00:53:09.599 --> 00:53:10.800
and convince them they're actually under

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.839
siege by the way actually

00:53:11.839 --> 00:53:13.440

anyone would deny that might be a

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.400
portrayed black people

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.920

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.880
you can't fix a problem using the same

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.400
kind of thinking that created it

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.720
albert einstein you can't do it dude you

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.920
can't this this is what they're doing

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.160
but didn't he make two nuclear bombs

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.720
no i mean lemaire i mean if people made

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.000
a nuclear bomb for the podcast wouldn't

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.440
be our fault it's just

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.280
[ __ ] figured it out but like you said

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.880
you can't fix your problem by

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.720
doing the same problem that created it

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.160
using the same type of thinking

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.319
he created two nuclear bombs did he

00:54:12.319 --> 00:54:13.520
create two nuclear bombs

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.440
he came he defected from germany to come

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.359
to america to give us the secrets of the

00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:20.160
nuclear bombs

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.000
that's you got that history a little but

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.720
yeah you're close

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.640
did he create so yeah technically he did

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.160
end the war with japan by

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.000
yeah i mean yeah i mean he came up with

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.920
the science i think maybe he regretted

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:34.559
it

00:54:34.559 --> 00:54:35.920
maybe people use his science and he

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.359
regretted it i don't know i know

00:54:37.359 --> 00:54:39.680
something about that

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.920
well still that's that's that's taking

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.119
it to another level yeah

00:54:43.119 --> 00:54:45.040
the whole idea and i just all i heard

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.880
well now it's your turn it's like

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.319
no it's not it's not a matter of turns

00:54:48.319 --> 00:54:49.920
like yeah whatever like what do you want

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.520
us to sit there for 10 years and watch

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:53.040

must be so many

00:55:57.359 --> 00:55:59.119
so many white kids first interactions

00:55:59.119 --> 00:56:00.400
with a black dude

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.400
and it's just a guy dressed like he

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.480
sells candy in the future like just some

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.280
[ __ ]

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.680
[ __ ] guy walking around like oh

now on vice that's just uh

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.880
two chains going around basically

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.319
they're just filming his reaction to

00:56:18.319 --> 00:56:18.880
things

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.960
really it's just two chains being like

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.440
how did you get so much money

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.079

00:56:26.079 --> 00:56:27.839
two james is actually pretty smart but

00:56:27.839 --> 00:56:29.280
you know the character he plays

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.280
yeah is not i'm a big fan of t-pain

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.640
school of business i think that's also

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.720
on dr drama

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.240
it's like if i turn on my tv there's

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.680
these weird like internet channels that

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.040
come on and teach to change

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.280
uh not two chains t-pain school of

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.960
business is so [ __ ] funny it's just

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.119
him it's just diner's driving some dives

00:56:45.119 --> 00:56:45.599
it's just

00:56:45.599 --> 00:56:47.680
guys he's pretty pain just being like

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.359
same thing like how'd you start this

00:56:49.359 --> 00:56:51.520
business like i did this he's like man

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.520
that's pretty good that's pretty cool

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.960
that's just him eating things but we

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.000
should complain about

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.359
the whites we should be worried about

00:56:57.359 --> 00:56:58.960
like guy fieri being out there being

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.559
like we're not that white

00:57:00.559 --> 00:57:02.880
hell like i mean the same way they put

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.799
like black dudes on tv and be like all

00:57:04.799 --> 00:57:05.359
right

00:57:05.359 --> 00:57:08.400
slow down like you know exactly your

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.119
point like if

00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:10.799
white people should be like we're not

00:57:10.799 --> 00:57:13.040
all that white yeah like guy fieri's on

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.680
tv like whoa this sauce is gangsta

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.160
yeah it's like all right get him the

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.799
[ __ ] out of here

00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:24.319
true no that's true well there's also

00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:26.160
the problem is a lot of this stuff than

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.000
the media narrative has been

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.040
guided by like super elite whites

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.880
so it's like you know you have again the

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.400
knapsack invisible knapsack of white

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.559
privilege was written by peggy mcintosh

00:57:36.559 --> 00:57:38.160
dude you re if you actually read that

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.920
document this shit's based off of she

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:40.480
had demand

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.000
she had things in there like oh yeah i'm

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.440
white so if i write a thing it's going

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.359
to get published and it's like

00:57:45.359 --> 00:57:47.119
no dude you're [ __ ] you're elite her

00:57:47.119 --> 00:57:49.680
grade school to this day cost 30 000

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.599
a year to go to her grade school it was

00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:53.280
like a boarding school so she was kind

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.160
of like

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.319
being white is easy and it's like you

00:57:56.319 --> 00:57:57.839
have a couple points there but you're

00:57:57.839 --> 00:57:59.760
also in like the point one percent so

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.920
she's conflating being white with like

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.640
having like a fifth generation like

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.440
lawyer

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.760
professional class father with like your

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.599
dad's dad was on a trust fund

00:58:09.599 --> 00:58:10.640
and that's the kind of you know that's

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.839
the thing that gets kind of put off and

00:58:11.839 --> 00:58:12.720
stuff but

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.920
but yeah that's that's the people who

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.200
are perpetuating this because i think

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.240
there's people who are like thought

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.160
leaders in these industries who are like

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.720
probably had them for sure had slaves

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.079
yeah man dude if you're

00:58:22.079 --> 00:58:23.520
if you're on a trust fund for three

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:26.000
generations most likely

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.839
[ __ ] absolutely someone either had

00:58:27.839 --> 00:58:29.760
slaves or like

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.160
didn't have slaves but like bought stuff

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.359
directly like

00:58:33.359 --> 00:58:36.400
that's like had him dude call guys

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.680
in order so you can fill these things

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.680
like those that's how those dudes made

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.359
you have generational wealth from that

00:58:41.359 --> 00:58:42.720
age yes

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:45.520
you most likely either again had slaves

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.880
or a very slave adjacent

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.880
where you're like your boy had slaves

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:50.240
and you're kind of like yo [ __ ] hook

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.839
me yeah let me get some chores

00:58:51.839 --> 00:58:53.280
so you have these people now who are

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.359
like oh [ __ ] and like they're

00:58:55.359 --> 00:58:57.119
in reality if that's the case dude

00:58:57.119 --> 00:58:58.240
that's that's the thing too with the

00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.440
oscars and all that [ __ ] these people we

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.720
need to do this it's like dude you have

00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.480
like 25 million dollars your disposal

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.440
yeah you could easily live off a two mil

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.760
if you if you mean this [ __ ] fork

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.280
[ __ ] give up

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:11.200
half of that if you're all about this

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:13.040
give up half of that dude there's

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.720
like an ny there's nyu professors who

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.319
are like oh we're communists it's like

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:17.760
you're a communist professor who makes

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.760
250 thousand dollars a year

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.520
it's like and also they have answers for

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.680
that well they're like wellness this is

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:24.240
the system

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.839
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like they

00:59:25.839 --> 00:59:27.599
have answers but how do you how do you

00:59:27.599 --> 00:59:28.400
share what's your

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.920
if i broke down your financials how do

00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:31.680
you use your resources do you use them

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.119
in a communistic fashion because you're

00:59:33.119 --> 00:59:34.160
perfectly

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.400
perfectly free to do so you know so it's

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.599
one of those things that's like

00:59:37.599 --> 00:59:39.440
i think it'd be sick if everyone made

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.559
that couple million or like all right

00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:41.680
i'm cool and just like took the rest of

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.559
the money and just

00:59:42.559 --> 00:59:44.839
did stuff with it but yeah like bill and

00:59:44.839 --> 00:59:47.839
melinda

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.319
yeah i uh yeah i don't know what to

00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:51.040
think about that

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:53.200
it really blows if he's actually that

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.640
would suck that way

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:57.359
which seems way more likely well here

00:59:57.359 --> 00:59:57.760
this is

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.160
i don't know dude it's possible it's

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.040
here's here's

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.559
it is totally possible and you know

01:00:02.559 --> 01:00:04.160
people don't want to hear this because

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.040
again

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.359
i watched that one documentary uh it was

01:00:07.359 --> 01:00:08.640
a part of it of [ __ ]

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.839
who the hell is that guy uh i don't know

01:00:11.839 --> 01:00:13.760
i can't he's a he's a big conspiracy guy

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.319
corbett

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:17.359
the corvette report not corvair corvette

01:00:17.359 --> 01:00:18.559
and he was like do i think i talked

01:00:18.559 --> 01:00:19.520
about this before he was shown his

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.559
financials i mean like

01:00:20.559 --> 01:00:21.920
look how much his wealth grew at the

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.760
time he unleashed all of his like

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.000
disease stuff and if you just check the

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.040
stock his stock

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.400
he owns microsoft stock and you look at

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.680
his shares he's like that guy should

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.960
have even more than that

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.760
um but then you get into the sick and

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.839
twisted realm of trillion dollar markets

01:00:35.839 --> 01:00:36.880
man

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.280
it's a trillion dollar industry

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.559
trillions of dollars

01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:42.799
at stake to be like who gets to say

01:00:42.799 --> 01:00:44.400
imagine this vaccine imagine people

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.839
don't really know but it's like imagine

01:00:45.839 --> 01:00:47.280
if you could make trillions of dollars

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.400
by being like

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.400
you had the data and you're like all

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.640
right four people get to sell them we're

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.359
all gonna

01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:54.839
give you a pie of like you know a couple

01:00:54.839 --> 01:00:56.880
trillion and it's like dude this shit's

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.319
kind of over anyway this shit's like

01:00:58.319 --> 01:00:58.880
ending so

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.400
we'll give people a thing you know like

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.400
the flu shot i never got a flu shot and

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.359
been like

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:05.040
thank god i got that flu shot so you're

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.400
gonna give a thing

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.880
more or less make people take it around

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.240
there's countries you could sell to or

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.200
you know for sure

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.200
they'll make the entire population take

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.200
it america i think they'll heavily shame

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.400
people into taking it and i don't know

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.240
if they'll actually require it yet

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.319
but it's like i don't know you get a guy

01:01:20.319 --> 01:01:21.280
who's in charge of that

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.359
it's like there could be foul serious

01:01:23.359 --> 01:01:25.440
foul for sure dude that's like

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.559
that's like a yeah you could

01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:30.640
take over a lot of the world yeah with

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.079
that type of thing

01:01:32.079 --> 01:01:34.720
it opens a lot of yeah it's a pretty big

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.319
i mean dude imagine how competitive

01:01:36.319 --> 01:01:39.200
stand-up comedy is now apply that to a

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.240
trillion dollar

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.240
market where like people have big-time

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.240
money big-time resources

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.680
it's the same people man i mean it's the

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.119
same kind of people it's just they're in

01:01:47.119 --> 01:01:48.160
a different arena yeah

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.119
and it's brought to you by people who

01:01:51.119 --> 01:01:52.319
basically hook the whole country on

01:01:52.319 --> 01:01:53.359
heroin

01:01:53.359 --> 01:01:54.640
and now all of a sudden they're calling

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.079
time out they're going to save us all

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:58.000
from a disease with a vaccine that we

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.039
all kind of have all right you brought

01:01:59.039 --> 01:01:59.599
me back

01:01:59.599 --> 01:02:00.880
you brought me back to the good side

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.319
[ __ ] bill gates well i'm saying i don't

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:03.280
know it would be

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.599
horrific if he actually was but again

01:02:05.599 --> 01:02:06.880
it's like apparently he

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.480
he is doing [ __ ] that's weird and the

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.160
thing they say that's you know again

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.839
sometimes i guess maybe he was on thing

01:02:11.839 --> 01:02:13.760
one day now he's like heavily into

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.200
controlling the population he's on

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.599
record been like we have too many people

01:02:17.599 --> 01:02:19.440
so but he's also on secure disease and

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.200
it's like you know again

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.319
that's a legitimate concern with too

01:02:22.319 --> 01:02:23.599
many people now he's like well no maybe

01:02:23.599 --> 01:02:24.880
he just wants a cure disease now who

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:25.760
knows

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.680
but like you know and apparently again i

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.760
don't know this for a fact but his

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.079
dad i think or grandfather was like big

01:02:32.079 --> 01:02:33.599
into eugenics

01:02:33.599 --> 01:02:35.280
yeah of being like steve i heard that on

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.440
warmouth sterilizing people and like you

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:37.920
know there are

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.400
i was i was driving listen to war mode

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.039
bees here actually

01:02:43.039 --> 01:02:45.039
and it was like i they'd say [ __ ] where

01:02:45.039 --> 01:02:46.559
i'd just be like

01:02:46.559 --> 01:02:48.480
like i just remember like coming in and

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.359
out of listening to it and hearing like

01:02:51.359 --> 01:02:53.359
bill and melinda there's pictures of

01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:54.559
bill's

01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:58.160
father with barbara walters

walters

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.440
well that yeah that is the uh and that's

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.559
the thing too man

01:03:08.559 --> 01:03:10.400
like you get into all like the weird

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.240
people's thing of like transferring

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.839
power to like other people like you know

01:03:13.839 --> 01:03:15.280
you can you do it in good people look at

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.079
people and they're like

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:17.280
oh my god they're the best and you

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.039
transfer them into like deity status and

01:03:19.039 --> 01:03:20.160
you have other people you transfer them

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.200
to like negative

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.280
like total demon status and it's just

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.480
kind of like where do you think you lie

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.599
these days

01:03:25.599 --> 01:03:26.720
demon status you think you've been

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.240
transferred you basically are living

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.200
bill gates

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.960
basically bill gates was the man coming

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.720
up he was fun everybody was like look at

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.319
this goofy dork and then the last like

01:03:34.319 --> 01:03:35.440
five years everyone's like

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.119
evil piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] well

01:03:37.119 --> 01:03:38.240
here's the thing too did you see the

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.920
documentary not you weren't a goofy dork

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.119
but i'm not saying he was likable and

01:03:41.119 --> 01:03:42.960
then now he betrayed everybody

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.119
of course well dude he true and i i am

01:03:45.119 --> 01:03:47.280
gay i'm full of gates full hill dog

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.799
i take responsibility dude that's the

01:03:48.799 --> 01:03:50.640
thing i take full responsibility no

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.319
i'm [ __ ] chasing i'm a hilldog you're

01:03:52.319 --> 01:03:53.920
not gates and hillary i'm not

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.319
but well you're hill gates look there's

01:03:56.319 --> 01:03:58.640
that's there are part

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.240
there are parts of us that we have in

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.079
common with bill gates there's parts of

01:04:02.079 --> 01:04:04.000
us that we deny we say like oh no no i

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.280
don't i don't i could never be

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.799
that's not part of me i can never go and

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:09.280
like circum circumcise everybody in

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:09.680
africa

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.760
yeah yeah he did an interview where it

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.440
was just he was running down the facts

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.240
about like

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.160
the side effects of the vaccines and

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.280
they're like have there been

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.000
he's like no no no there's been they've

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.440
caused their okay so they put

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.440
some people in severe pain and they blah

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.480
blah blah but

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.520
you know and people are just kind of

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.039
like [ __ ] you dude like i want to see

01:04:27.039 --> 01:04:27.920
you take it

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.160
yeah so he like they asked about the

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.079
side effects and again it's like

01:04:32.079 --> 01:04:35.520
you're watching a guy on live tv why he

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.640
i don't understand why he is the

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.480
mouthpiece for like our defense against

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.079
viruses it is kind of strange that like

01:04:40.079 --> 01:04:41.359
you know people like why is trump even

01:04:41.359 --> 01:04:42.799
talking about this it's like maybe

01:04:42.799 --> 01:04:44.720
bill gates studied viruses more but it

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.280
is strange that he's not a doctor

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.039
and talking about this like he's just

01:04:49.039 --> 01:04:50.559
like we have it we're good and it's like

01:04:50.559 --> 01:04:52.000
why are you mouthpiecing this

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.240
it is yeah yeah yeah yeah he is doing it

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.359
but again it's

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:57.760
look you're not gonna they whatever net

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.200
neutrality was i don't even know what it

01:04:59.200 --> 01:04:59.760
is

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.599
they dunked on us everyone's like i

01:05:01.599 --> 01:05:02.960
don't want that you shouldn't want that

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:03.599
either and i

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:04.799
was like what is this again they're all

01:05:04.799 --> 01:05:06.799
like oh we passed net neutrality they're

01:05:06.799 --> 01:05:08.480
doing they're going to do this [ __ ]

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.319
yeah they're going to do it unless

01:05:10.319 --> 01:05:12.000
people actually

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.760
organize into some sort of thing that's

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.440
not like a bunch of [ __ ] people

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:17.760
taking like tvs and doing [ __ ] until

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.799
people come in and they're like

01:05:18.799 --> 01:05:21.280
or actually immerse themselves in the

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.720
literature around this and rather than

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.680
being like

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.720
what is this someone's going to make me

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.119
get a needle i hate needles therefore

01:05:27.119 --> 01:05:29.039
i hate all you guys too it's a simple

01:05:29.039 --> 01:05:30.559
it's like a really super simplistic way

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:31.039
yeah

01:05:31.039 --> 01:05:33.440
but i don't know i'm not getting the

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.960
[ __ ] i think i'm not getting that all of

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.480
that to say this i'm not [ __ ] getting

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.000
back i think immersing yourself in

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
literature though is

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.680
can also not really be helpful dude

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.200
you'll end up you can immerse yourself

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.319
in whatever

01:05:44.319 --> 01:05:47.119
literature you want exactly and end up

01:05:47.119 --> 01:05:48.400
you know

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.359
being like a anti-vaxx mom you could but

01:05:51.359 --> 01:05:53.200
the problem is so then this is the other

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.319
part

01:05:54.319 --> 01:05:55.599
you'd have to so you know order to

01:05:55.599 --> 01:05:57.119
understand like the quote people say i

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.640
look at the scientific literature

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.760
you have to have like a like a phd level

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.280
uh understanding of statistics where you

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.480
can look at you can look at a study and

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.920
it can tell you like oh this thing

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.839
worked out but if you can't like

01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:09.680
look at the validity of like oh we use

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.119
like the krueger method

01:06:11.119 --> 01:06:14.079
thing of a do bio dual feedback they

01:06:14.079 --> 01:06:15.119
like have these numbers and they have

01:06:15.119 --> 01:06:16.559
machines to like make sense of the

01:06:16.559 --> 01:06:17.680
numbers that if you don't understand

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.559
that math

01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:20.240
you don't you can't really determine the

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.839
validity of most stuff i mean you can

01:06:21.839 --> 01:06:23.039
say like if we had a sample size of

01:06:23.039 --> 01:06:23.920
three people you could say that's

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.760
[ __ ] but yeah people

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.359
being like oh i read a study it's like

01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:28.799
there's hundreds of studies and it's

01:06:28.799 --> 01:06:30.000
like what were the you know

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.359
how do they do it how do they select

01:06:31.359 --> 01:06:32.960
people like you're saying it's right

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.920
you're right because you could

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.760
read all of them and end up with the

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.400
fact that the you know the literature

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.720
disagrees too so really all you have is

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.760
your experience

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.039
so it's like you have to just make it

01:06:43.039 --> 01:06:44.799
you know thing off your experience but

01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:47.119
it does feel good to like boogie man

01:06:47.119 --> 01:06:48.960
boogie man people out and

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.760
again it's like i i the other part too

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.480
is though is like

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.720
i'm not taking that [ __ ] vaccine man

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.839
i'm not they're 30

01:06:55.839 --> 01:06:57.359
they pulled people i think 30 percent of

01:06:57.359 --> 01:06:59.200
people are like not no chance i'm taking

01:06:59.200 --> 01:06:59.520
it

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.440
and another like 25 were like i'm not

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.599
sure i'm in that 25.

01:07:03.599 --> 01:07:05.039
i'm gonna let some other people take it

01:07:05.039 --> 01:07:06.160
for a while i think that's what

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.200
everyone's planning on well

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.960
first of all but i don't know i don't

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.960
know because i've blindly taken every

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.480
other vaccine

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.839
when's the last time you got a vaccine i

01:07:13.839 --> 01:07:16.079
have no [ __ ] dude when we had maya

01:07:16.079 --> 01:07:17.119
they were like you need to get this you

01:07:17.119 --> 01:07:18.240
need to get that you need to get this

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.119
and it's like

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:20.480
i'm cool i got like one of them i got

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.559
like the one just because you

01:07:22.559 --> 01:07:24.559
yeah you know like you have to get all

01:07:24.559 --> 01:07:27.119
these other ones like foot and mouth and

01:07:27.119 --> 01:07:29.200
these weird [ __ ] babies get it's like

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.400
well they're they wanted me to get a

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.640
roman dude like legionnaires disease and

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.000
all this yeah they wanted me to get a

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.839
flu shot and it was like i think i got

01:07:35.839 --> 01:07:37.200
the flu shot just because i was like it

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.240
was there with britain brittany's like

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.119
you know i'm gonna do it for her i'm

01:07:39.119 --> 01:07:40.240
like i'll get the flu shot then they hit

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.160
me with another one i was like

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.880
good invitation if i and my wife was

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.039
like

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.839
i mean she's probably pretty of course

01:07:49.839 --> 01:07:51.119
but they do they started hitting you

01:07:51.119 --> 01:07:52.079
think she was

01:07:52.079 --> 01:07:53.359
i think she's being reasonable he's like

01:07:53.359 --> 01:07:55.119
just yes i agree i didn't got it i was

01:07:55.119 --> 01:07:57.920
like whatever but again it's like

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.119
i don't know i don't understand what the

01:07:59.119 --> 01:08:00.400
flu shot it's a tough time to take a

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.079
stand on vaccines

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:04.240
it's not your wife's like do we get the

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.280
shot and you're like

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:08.000
have you looked at the bill gates i know

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.920
have you looked in the bill gates you

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:10.880
just got to fight

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.799
the hospital well i haven't really but

01:08:12.799 --> 01:08:14.640
i've heard people say stuff about him

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.239
dude if the pediatrician i go to if i

01:08:16.239 --> 01:08:17.759
were to start being like well

01:08:17.759 --> 01:08:19.040
is there any side effects this lady

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.799
would be like are you [ __ ] serious

01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:21.679
she would snap

01:08:21.679 --> 01:08:23.279
on me yeah but then there's people who

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:24.960
i'll tell you the side effect of uh not

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.080
taking it is

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.839
smallpox but then they say with vaccines

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.120
if you don't have enough people taking

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.560
it they're kind of pointless

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.839
because if you can't get enough people

01:08:33.839 --> 01:08:35.759
again i could be totally wrong

01:08:35.759 --> 01:08:37.440
me and bill gates are just amateurs here

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.719
do you know how they used to inoculate

01:08:38.719 --> 01:08:39.199
people

01:08:39.199 --> 01:08:42.239
how they used to so if there was like a

01:08:42.239 --> 01:08:44.239
pox or a measles outbreak like a pox

01:08:44.239 --> 01:08:47.040
outbreak they would put a guy in a cart

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:50.080
who had it yeah and bring him house to

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.040
house

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.199
to people who agreed to inoculate cut a

01:08:53.199 --> 01:08:55.120
piece of them off

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.040
cut you open and put it in you huh be

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.040
like hopefully you live

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.679
that's how people used to get inoculated

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.359
yeah yeah yeah so this dude was just

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:05.520
suffering in the back of a wagon all day

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.040
oh there was caught him they'd be like

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.880
bless you some priest would be cut him

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.600
up

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.600
yeah pretty rough that's what vaccines

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.279
saw it in john adams so it has to be

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:13.600
true

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.960
it's probably it sounds about right

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.199
definitely seems historically accurate

01:09:17.199 --> 01:09:19.040
oh my god yeah it was a fun one to watch

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.640
so they would they would cut it

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:23.120
like cut off one of his [ __ ] scabs

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.600
cut your arm open put it in you

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.960
yeah and then they would just get

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.640
horrible smallpox yeah why wouldn't you

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.920
just like take your chances of whether

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.880
or not you get it because you're

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.440
definitely

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.799
i don't know was that like was that

01:09:32.799 --> 01:09:34.480
taken as like a weakened version of it

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.759
i guess it was a weakened version like

01:09:35.759 --> 01:09:37.759
while he was dying of it i don't know

01:09:37.759 --> 01:09:40.319
ugh seems like yeah they just they were

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:41.440
like yeah you're probably gonna

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.799
like there's a chance you could die if

01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:44.480
you take this yeah

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.560
that yeah john adams daughter almost did

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:47.600
that there is

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.159
there is a good chance that the um if

01:09:50.159 --> 01:09:51.359
you have like you know if you're in the

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:52.960
elite like super elites of like you know

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.920
you have billions and billions and

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.199
billions of dollars

01:09:55.199 --> 01:09:56.480
there is a good chance there's a bunch

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.440
of people who are like you know we got

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.480
too many people here we got to do

01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.520
something about this

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.760
and they're just you know slowly

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.760
depopulate well also i heard it'll

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.520
depopulation kind of can happen itself

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.880
with um

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.840
the fact that like people are just

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.840
having less kids in like two generations

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.159
like

01:10:10.159 --> 01:10:13.920
boomers here true yeah india and africa

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.600
and china and all that well china you

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.880
can't you still can get penalized for

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.880
having too many

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.239
you can only i think you only have two

01:10:20.239 --> 01:10:21.600
in china unless you pay i think you have

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.000
to

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.360
be able to pay extra if you don't have

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.640
if you don't pay extra they'll force you

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.640
they'll like sterilize you

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.760
yeah i don't know they do it through the

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.239
week still they forced out

01:10:30.239 --> 01:10:32.560
if you're if you're weaker in china and

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.320
you have more than uh

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.480
two kids like you'll get chemicals yeah

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.320
you get yeah they they sterilize you

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.080
damn that does sound like like a

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.480
uyghur's uh rap album

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.440
chemical cashews yeah that sounds

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.640
exactly like something a

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:50.800
white like icp wieger would like what

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.239
chemical castration spelled with like

01:10:52.239 --> 01:10:52.690
case

01:10:52.690 --> 01:10:56.640
[Laughter]

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.960
yeah man yeah i'll be again i don't

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.719
think i was at a i was just at a

01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:02.159
friend's house recently and there

01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:03.360
it was he was just kind of like bringing

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.320
[ __ ] up like that he's like what do you

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.600
guys think about the vaccine

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.199
like mom's birthday it's so funny

01:11:09.199 --> 01:11:10.640
i feel like well and yeah people just

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.480
like most people were like

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.440
same thing everyone's like i'll let

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.560
other people but they're going to make

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:15.920
other people take that first they're

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.040
already in the

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.000
i think they've already given it to

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.520
animals and the third phase they're

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.159
going to do

01:11:20.159 --> 01:11:22.560
is human trials so we're going to test

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.080
this out on poor people basically

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.760
so we'll get like you ever meet people

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.360
who do like medical trials

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.760
yeah drunks usually like heroin addicts

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:30.880
they're heroin addicts looking for

dude

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.840

that's what i'm telling you man that's

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.080
what they do they find people who

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.280
need money to the point where they're

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.280
like [ __ ] it i'll take this thing

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.719
they test it on they see what happens

01:11:54.719 --> 01:11:55.679
and right now they said they're at the

01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:56.960
phase where like he's like yeah some

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.239
people are having extremely painful

01:11:58.239 --> 01:12:00.960
reactions but

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.600
he's like but he was saying there wasn't

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.040
any serious like life-threatening

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.640
complications yet

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:07.840
so i was like dude i'm not [ __ ]

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.840
taking that thing yeah i just i'm just

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.159
not

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.719
you should take it as repentance my mom

01:12:12.719 --> 01:12:14.400
hit me with the funniest [ __ ] logic i

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.760
was talking to her yesterday and she was

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.800
like

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.280
yeah i saw a homeless guy outside cvs

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.800
and he was like coughing and stuff and i

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.679
was just like

01:12:21.679 --> 01:12:23.120
kind of nervous but she was like but

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.480
then again like if this was really that

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.679
bad wouldn't all the homeless people be

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:27.840
dead

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.830
i guess well maybe you like that one

01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:32.400
[Laughter]

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.320
i guess yeah that's fair that's how we

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.600
know it's safe to come out when there's

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:36.080
just no

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.920
homeless people left they are out

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.760
especially in cleveland dude

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.679
they were out really cleveland had a

01:12:41.679 --> 01:12:44.080
[ __ ] strong amount of bombs dude

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.000
does it really yeah that's weird i was

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.520
surprised yeah it is surprising

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.120
cleveland was a nice city actually

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.920
in the small area that i was in but the

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.640
bombs were there

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.000
san francisco has the worst san

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.280
francisco might have the most bombs i've

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:55.679
ever seen

01:12:55.679 --> 01:12:59.040
that sucked from walking walking

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.960
just to the venue to do a show from the

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.080
hotel was just

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.679
like 10 different bumps they're bummed

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:05.199
to non-binding they're good might be

01:13:05.199 --> 01:13:05.520
like

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.120
one bomb to four people they're

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.480
aggressive as [ __ ] was there so many

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.840

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.920
there's so many bums they gotta step up

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.040

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.320
robot face chomped and you just go

01:13:55.679 --> 01:13:58.320
like trying to entice american and other

01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.280
you know there's people i guess

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.120
economies who like have money still

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.800
you can get a weird citizenship there

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.159
where you're able to live there for a

01:14:04.159 --> 01:14:04.640
year

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.840
