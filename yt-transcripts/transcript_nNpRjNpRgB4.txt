00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.479
like another human being

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.240
oh and they'll realize i'm like like

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.759
kind of like it's just

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.360

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.439
led the charge and kicking who i i would

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.040

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.159
out and i'll see them now and they're

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:28.799

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.240
now

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.759
every time they participate in class do

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.560
you chime in afterwards it's just

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.720
um i well no i i'm the same way as i've

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.920
always been if i hear something that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.399
just

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.000
sounds kind of ridiculous i'm just kind

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.840
of like yeah no i don't

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.040
you know i don't agree we're dude they

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.640
were talking about uh it's actually

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.439
pretty cool they're talking about

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.439
prolonged exposure therapy

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.880
so like if you so say if um

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.240
if shane were to like pass you in the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.079
street and grab your genitals

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.000
what yeah i'm just saying this is for

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.520
the for the sake of never

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.000
do that so if shane so if you were to go

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.879
by

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.280
and just pop down the back of shane's

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.920
jeans and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.520
navigate through a sweaty butt crack and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.360
pop a finger up his butt yeah

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.280
shane could go to prolonged exposure

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.120
therapy where he would have to sit down

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.840
and be like

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.360
tell the story of the time you fingered

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.040
his butt uh

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.200
so you tell it over and over and over

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.560
until you fully

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.640
integrate the narrative into like a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.080
different part of your it's like if

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.160
a trauma occurs it's kind of like kicks

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.440
around your amygdala

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.560
until you put it into words stick their

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.319
finger in his ass for a long time

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.080
yeah that's what i thought it's like all

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.120
right well that's what happens you're

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.920
saying you just keep

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.760
fingering his ass yeah just keep getting

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.200
like see it's not that bad

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.680
yeah you just sit here for a while yeah

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.120
but the trauma would be the fact that

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.440
you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.879
went and snuck on shane yeah yeah but

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.879
plus you violated your guys's friendship

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.239
first of all yeah

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.840
there's a trauma of betrayal first and

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.360
foremost

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.440
we get over it i think that's actually

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.640
what i'm doing right now

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.560
what going on podcasts and talking about

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.760
the trauma

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.280
yeah it's still what i mean it you

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.560
experience it through the amygdala

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.120
because it's like a it's a treat

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.959
has just been such a dude it's been so

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.120
hard for the whole time my amigo has

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.319
been rock hard

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.959
and i can feel it

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.640
a thing that happens i need to release

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.159
and you can start talking about it

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.000
now you're dealing with it from your

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.920
your cerebral cortex now you're dealing

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.959
with it objectively

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.200
rather than being like oh god oh i like

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.640
seeing o'connor's aren't like flyers

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.080
gear i'm like oh god he's gonna have

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.159
anybody in orange oh god yeah anyone in

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.599
orange every time i see gritty

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.400
i'm just like oh that's a connor finger

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.040
my ass again

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.000
nelson's it sounds like that you i feel

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.680
like most people just repeat it until

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.319
they like

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.200
it's it's almost like uh making a copy

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.799
of a copy they just keep like repeating

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.799
the story and changing it slightly until

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.239
it's like more comfortable for them in

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:56.799
their head

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.560
that's the theory yeah you desensitize

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.000
yourself over time through exposing

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.400
yourself

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.000
over and over and over and over oh i was

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.439
saying that you like start to lie to

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:04.959
yourself about what really happened you

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.319
know what i mean

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.799
no why would you do that well i'm just

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.239
saying that's what people do

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.080
that's right i like i don't know i've

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.080
always that's why i have such a hard

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.879
time with like

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.199
therapy and stuff i feel like people

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.479
start telling tall tales

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.880
yeah people do yeah people do they go in

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.560
and they like they tell a version of the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.160
story that makes them look good and the

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.840
therapist is like yeah no i think you're

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.160
right

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.240
where are you getting this from because

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.759
o'connor's a shitty person that would go

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:30.479
into it i don't

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.440
do no i don't do it i don't know i've

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.960
experienced it because i've i've gone to

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.880
therapy and i've started telling a story

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.240
that's what i just said what yeah so

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.080
you're projecting no no i tell i tell

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.360
you

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.199
i'm telling a story accurately but i

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.040
want them to question it

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.320
yeah and when they're not questioning

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.759
it's like oh so so anyone could just

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.000
come in here and say [ __ ] whatever

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.440
and then you wind up fixing a fake story

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.479
are you like going in there and

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.160
silencing of the lambs in your therapist

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.759
you're like yeah who knows which version

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.520
of the truth i'm telling you

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.960
i don't know i i just i get off track so

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.000
fast because like

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.360
it's like i don't want you to think that

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.120
i'm saying this because it was like this

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.080
that's the whole point of going to

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.600
therapy you eventually learn how to let

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.280
your guard down

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.720
and just relate yourself to another

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.560
human being in a way that's not like

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.880
agendized well that's what i don't have

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.080
an agenda

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.919
but i don't think that they're they're

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.199
they're like not paying attention if

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.800
they're not criticizing the story it's

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.320
like oh really they said that

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.600
that's what i want to hear someone be

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.800
like dude go back to therapy

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.160
you're not making a great deal right now

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.080
just explain this to them

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.000
i do i do and what are they and they

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.360
they don't they don't make a lot of

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.000
progress

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.160
how many have you seen one therapist now

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.320
i've gone to like two or three

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.479
two or three what's the answer uh it's a

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:43.840
number that low you know the answer

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.400
it's three so it's three and you fibbed

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.240
to all of them i didn't fib

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.639
and all three of them didn't like you uh

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.400
that was that very much the vibe that i

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.880
got

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.840
my first therapist ghosted me really

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.120
yeah

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.360
and i dated i dated a therapist for a

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.360
little while and like she was saying

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.000
that like

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.840
you know the whole approach is to not be

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.240
judgmental and let someone like

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.000
tell their truth and it's just like no

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.680
don't

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.000
criticize their version of reality and

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.440
they you know make them defend but

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.199
that's subjective to your what you think

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.240
their reality should be

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.840
oh you know what i got popping around my

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.600
amygdala what

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.680
this is the one thing this whole thing

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.800
that has been [ __ ]

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.120
killing me is i'm a comedian that pushes

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.520
boundaries ah

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.800
oh that is dude that has been eating at

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.680
me

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.840
yeah that's not that bad it's not i

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.600
understand how you think yeah

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.240
i know where i was in the moment when i

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.199
wrote that

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.360
and why i wrote it so i can justify it

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.360
like there was a ton of pressure at the

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.919
time

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:45.919
my manager just said those words to me

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:47.039
like before i was like

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.880
i need to i need to go walk away and

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.400
write this i had five years

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.240
i'd like five to ten minutes to write

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.080
something and that's

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.800
the [ __ ] i'm a comedian that pushes

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.360
boundaries

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.599
just dude it's better than it's better

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:01.440
than [ __ ] i'm probably one of the

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.000
edgiest

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.160
most offensive comedians of all time i

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.360
probably yeah who's

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.759
all said and done you know i don't want

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.720
to name him

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.039
the king the king is sting [ __ ] the

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:12.080
castle

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.919
oh [ __ ] no no no no no no no no no i

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.199
thought you're going to titus

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.960
oh no we don't need dude justin well

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.960
here's the deal [ __ ] it no no no i don't

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.880
know i got no beef i'm just saying that

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.080
it's like that's that's where

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.720
yeah yeah here's the thing first of all

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.160
shane the fact that you didn't

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.599
completely

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:32.240
under the national spotlight and not

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.360
even a spotlight

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.639
national ire you didn't completely cave

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:40.000
and just write some [ __ ] yeah you

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
were in that space and the essence of

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.360
that message

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.360
is one of strength and resilience that i

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.960
mean the message is that anybody that's

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.759
actually upset

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.160
i do apologize yes you guys are really

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.000
upset with strength and resilience thank

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.400
you

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.919
so it's like even i wouldn't get hung up

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.599
on the verb the phraseology first

00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:57.680
[ __ ] sentence just kills me though

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.520
yeah i'm a comedian that pushes

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.960
boundaries it's like

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.039
damn that sucks yeah yeah but you know

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:05.440
what his boundaries what does that mean

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.039
that sucked i would push boundaries do

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:09.520
your boundaries i am upset about that

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.360
people set up a boundary and you pushed

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.960
it yeah dude

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.680
is that that is knocking around damn

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.039
that's that's in the amygdala

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:18.720
i even thought it's funny too because no

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.160
one else is thinking about that besides

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.440
you like you know every once in a while

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.639
on twitter someone's like pushing

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.240
boundaries is not just saying rachel's

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:24.879
slippers

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.160
yeah i'm like you know what it kind of

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.319
is yeah i think that's you guys have

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:29.440
created boundaries

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.960
and like if you say a bad word you're

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.719
crossing the line sure right right

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:33.919
they're like this is not pushing

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.440
boundaries all you're doing is crossing

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.560
a line and it's like

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.039
what do you think of boundaries

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:39.760
literally you're

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.839
repeating what i said yeah yeah no

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:43.599
that's not the line the boundary is more

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:44.880
three-dimensional yeah and then the

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.200
other

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.480
you're bringing them this euclidean

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.320
[ __ ] dude they're like that

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.160
all these people being like oh saying

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.600
words like that is not

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.600
new it's not edgy and it's like well

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.120
neither is telling people what they

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.080
can't say

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.640
yeah that's thousands of years old too

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.360
and also

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.279
for sure might be older

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:05.600
saying whatever the [ __ ] my favorite

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.519
thing is

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:09.040
there's nothing older than being like

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.800
can't say that

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.160
my favorite thing is that people being

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.519
like oh you think you're edgy and

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.399
risk-taking

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:16.480
it's like well i'm facing some pretty

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.600
serious consequences

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.680
so i guess i did risk something yeah

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.519
yeah yeah people like it's not edgy it's

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.160
like well

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.920
people that are friends cnn just called

me so

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.440
yeah yeah and it's like people that are

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.360
friends with you can't even say

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.640
they can't even chime and be like i know

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.240
that guy's a good dude otherwise it's

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.200
like they'll lose

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.959
their job that's how [ __ ] radioactive

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:38.160
being like hey what's going on in

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.880
[Laughter]

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.640

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.480
people like i had this there's this one

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.200

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:05.279
fun of somebody that would be

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:06.800

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.760
but that kid's been dying to be a

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.920
[ __ ] martyr

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.399
they all want to be activists so [ __ ]

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:18.959
bad

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:21.120
well it's also like again i've said this

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.959
before that it's

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:24.800
there's nothing being accomplished you

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.800
have comedians who are trying to

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.959
gain exposure by like taking shots at

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:30.480
you you're trying to do your thing

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.440
you're just trying to have a comedy

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.320
podcast

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.240
and when they criticize you it's like

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.680
the issues that they're

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.600
really claiming to be against what's

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.959
happening in those realms when they're

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:39.519
like

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.200
i don't think he should be on snl it's

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.120
like dude shut up

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.320
if you're such an activist go get a [ __ ]

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.279
go start a

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.519
a ged program or some [ __ ] dude yeah

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:50.560
yeah yeah your

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.079
blog is going to save the world i have a

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:54.000
big problem with activist art

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
dude yeah if it did anything trump

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.320
wouldn't be president

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.720
if it did

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.839
the house and the senate and the

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:05.519
presidency would be dominated by

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:06.720
democrats for the past

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.519
40 years if activists aren't really

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:10.720
anything the problem is

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.640
that it's like they just make art and

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.720
then some like the other kid who

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.320
actually wants to destroy the world or

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.120
take it over

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.880
joins like the young republicans club he

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.399
puts on a blazer and he figures out how

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:21.440
to do paperwork

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.810
and then they dominate everything

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.480
[Laughter]

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.320
it's like yeah you're making your art

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.600
while some little kid's figuring out

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.200
like what form you got to fill out to

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.640
like make sure black people can't

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.000
vote you're like i actually made a

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.279
collage about this

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:37.839

his body out and put like a death mask

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.560

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.399
death mask when you like put plaster

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:15.920
over someone's face just died

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.240
i embedded that because we did this like

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.000
show with like automobiles we

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.760
certainly you know made into art and

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.200
like it was just all about him and it's

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.480
like

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.160
sure it was maybe i'm a maybe i'm a

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.760
[ __ ] psychopath

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.760
but i'm like you sure you're not kind of

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.360
like using

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.519
other people's [ __ ] to like boost your

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:34.480
artistic because

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.560
every person who does art has like a

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.079
wild [ __ ] ego

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:40.880
yeah everybody yeah every dude ever like

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.600

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.680
what propels artistic like artistic

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.040
endeavors the point where that's what

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.639
you're doing in life yeah the fact that

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:48.079
you think you should [ __ ] say

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:48.560
something

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.560
yeah yeah if anybody have that ego you

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.000
would have quit right away exactly you

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.519
would have done

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:55.200

are allowing him to be here

00:15:58.639 --> 00:15:59.920
and they're like he wrote a really

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.360
impressive article on the state of

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.800
comedy which was i think this was like

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.160
two years old so he's been doing this

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.440
for a while right right

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.800
and uh he got

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.160
when they introduced him he literally

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.839
like half step jog

00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:13.600
like prances up to the thing he's like

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.880
this fast poem

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.959
like that's how he talk he talks weird

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:18.480
dude

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.320
he takes a swig of his water bottle real

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.000
quick and they think it's a joke

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.440
yeah but then he does it like three or

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.480
four more times and everyone in the

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.680
audience is like oh this kid's just you

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.560

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.759
super uncomfortable he's got problems

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:29.759
he's got trump's water issues he does

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:31.040
dude he sips like trump

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.320

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.120
goes

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.040
he just swings it as fast as he can he's

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.160
like next poem is my mother's journal

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.120

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.360
had some poems and i was like pretty

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:47.839
good

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:50.720
not bad truthfully i think on the record

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.560
seth simons is a decent poet

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.079
really i believe that you're really

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:55.600
turning the other cheek bro i'm [ __ ]

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.240
stupid

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.839
watch the video it's hilarious i mean i

00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:59.680
knew it was [ __ ] corny enough that

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.519
if i filmed phil watching it i was gonna

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:04.160
get a good he has some bars

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.240
simon says bars spit some bars now under

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.439
the new context of

00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:09.199
that he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] that i don't

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:11.120
like it's hard to enjoy it

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.959
yeah but if he was cool and i watched

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:14.640
that i'd be like nice man

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.400
damn you should start writing articles

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.079
about his poems i might write an article

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:18.880
about

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.880
his poetry yeah like how problematic it

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.720
is yes

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.400
i don't even think it wasn't it was just

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.839
you know sweet wholesome

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.240
good poetry dude yeah i really enjoyed

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.760
it that's why i think seth simons

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.039
tackles the issues

00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:32.880
i think he's onto something i think if

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.480
he keeps you know doing the

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.760
i don't know i don't want to bash this

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.160
guy [ __ ] it that's why this is it's

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.240
i'm just appreciating his poetry i

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.559
genuinely didn't mind some of his poems

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:43.760
and i'm just sitting there like all

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.400

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.960
enemies burning down the house

no it's so funny to see him when you're

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:58.080
seeing me like oh my god

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.000

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.960
the evil version of him

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.360

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.559
to being woke

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:22.720
he went through a slight woke phase back

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.760
and then

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.440
he busted out of it which is nice now

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.760
he's pure evil dude yeah that [ __ ]

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.919
bothered me one guy made a video

00:18:29.919 --> 00:18:32.160

denying young brennan crick young barn

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.440

genuinely forgot i lived it right

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.520
it's fair enough and then in the video i

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.280

with him yeah

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.320
he doesn't want all his new friends to

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.320

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.919

again again

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.160
everybody talking [ __ ] even like uh when

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.120
schab was like

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.600
that podcast just isn't funny i would

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.679
probably say the same thing

00:19:57.679 --> 00:19:59.360
like i would watch a clip of somebody's

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.440
podcast two completely unknown dudes

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.960
and i'd just be like well it's just not

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.080
funny that's their biggest [ __ ]

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.120
problem and then keep

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.799
like i'm not i wouldn't i know i

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:08.720
wouldn't but i can't divorce myself

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.200
because it's

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.280
me i would like i would love if i saw me

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.440
oh i will say this if i saw

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.360
our podcast the clip that they said if i

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.200
knew a guy got fired for using a racial

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.280
slur that racial slur from snl i'd be

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.240
like these guys

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.200
[ __ ] rule this is hilarious yeah i

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:23.679
can't

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:25.679
but i totally understand what people

00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:27.200
like i don't like the possibility thing

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.720
i didn't listen to what jessie next said

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.080
i didn't listen to it so maybe

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.520
total non-take it was 100 percent

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.880
non-takeover maybe i would be upset i

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.159
didn't read it or listen to it he's like

00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:35.919
well it's just funny watching louis

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:38.320
struggle with this stuff i did read that

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.240
that bothered me that's a funny thing

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.000
also all the comics and [ __ ] that we

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.360
have [ __ ] on in the past

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.360
are almost all directly related to them

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.880
coming out against louie

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.720
yeah yeah it's almost crazy someone

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.919
would come out against louie i'd be like

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:52.159
that person's [ __ ] gay [ __ ] them

00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:54.080
yeah dude that bothered the [ __ ] out of

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.159
me but it's also again it's like

00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:59.840
these are the most ego maniacal people

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.159
or one of the most egomaniacal groups

00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:03.200
are entertainers

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.400
yeah so like when people are like oh

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.840
it's like dude these [ __ ]

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.600
wheels are spinning 24

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.360
7 for how they can get attention on

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.200
themselves it's like it just

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.880
comes with the territory because it's

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.720
such a crazy thing to do

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.960
because it's like you either succeed or

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.840
fail

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.360
yeah so it's a real live and die cut

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.880
live or die kind of thing some people

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.320
come out i'm like

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.640
with stanhope he was talking about how

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.240
he's like comedians it's like

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.720
it's us against the world like where the

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.000
that's how it is and i was like dude

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.919
that is not what it is anymore maybe

00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:33.760
that's what it was when you started

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.280
but because he doesn't interact with

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.280
comics he's out in the desert

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.880
right and then he goes in tours and [ __ ]

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.640
it's sick stan hopes the [ __ ] god

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.679
that's [ __ ] sick but uh

00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:45.679
he i i said it to him i was like no

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:47.039
that's not it they're

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:48.480
dude they like when the mob started

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.720
snitching on each other to [ __ ]

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.720
kill you if you [ __ ] and they're just so

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.840
happy to do it oh yeah

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.080
every other comic is so happy to be like

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.080
haha you got fired

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.520
which is funny yeah it is funny yeah

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.200
yeah it's funny if you think it's funny

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.320
it's funny if you think it's funny but i

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.919
can tell with certain people they're

00:22:05.919 --> 00:22:08.880
so happy right right yeah yeah it's kind

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.240
of i don't know it's also when comedians

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:10.640
though

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.600
are like not that funny being like

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.280
there's no phony it's just like

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.120
that hurts there's also that vibe it's

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.200
just like okay there's also that vibe to

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.559
it where it feels like

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:24.480
um i don't know like before like a big

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.720
like playoff game or football game if

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.080
you're like coach went

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.320
like you saw that's like the star player

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.840
on the other team had like some like

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.600
equipment that was like illegal or

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.720
something

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.400
and the coach like goes over and tells

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.919
the ref and gets them like ejected

00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:40.320
before the game you're like

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.760
yeah but this is dishonorable

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.440
yeah you know what i mean this is like

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.799
that's a shitty thing to you know it's

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:47.600
like just be

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.520
if you were just funnier than the person

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.720
you didn't like

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.919
you wouldn't have to worry about them

00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:54.159
constantly yeah yeah it's like

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:55.760
that's at the small level these are

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.520
these guys like

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.600
someone like shop being like i don't

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.200
think that's funny

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.360
or not even being like i get it it's

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.640
like dude i would have said the same

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.880
i was in the basement like doing open

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.720
mics being like that comic

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.640
who's selling out arenas yeah i'm like

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.039
they [ __ ] suck [ __ ] them

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:14.720
so like i get it but i don't think yours

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.559
was as agendized as like

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:18.720
i i feel like ours was just saying it

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.240
was just like [ __ ] that dudes are

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:20.840
[ __ ]

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.559
guys being a [ __ ] about comedy so

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:23.760
there's there was like a

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.960
you know to me when i hear stuff like

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.679
that it's like

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:29.360
where are you coming from is there a

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.280
chance that if that's a if the article

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.320
was written differently you'd have a

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.360
different opinion

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.880
and if we were just chilling is that

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.080
exactly what you would say you know what

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.559
i mean

00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:38.480
and i have a feeling you know i i my

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.080
spidey senses go like that was kind of

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.880
like a

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.080
politically kind of responsibility

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.919
he i watched that whole like episode and

00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:47.760
he sort of like

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.279
he doesn't really stand by those

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:50.799
comments yeah i don't think he cared

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:54.000
he like yeah i really don't and i

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.720
i wouldn't i'm not sticking up for him

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.520
but it's like

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.679
i understand like i don't i was i didn't

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:02.400

didn't affect yeah yeah like that yeah

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:05.919
the

00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:08.720
cnn article bothered me what was that

i was privileged

00:24:22.159 --> 00:24:23.600
it's privileged i don't want to talk

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.840
about yeah yeah but

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.760
again whatever how'd you call her she's

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.039
like you have a collect call and she's

00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:30.000
like okay and you're like hi

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.919
it's me no i called him hey it's like

00:24:31.919 --> 00:24:33.279
[ __ ] guy you wrote a mean article

00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:33.840
hold up

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.480
bobby bobby kelly gotcha bobby and voss

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.120
plug me in

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.240
bobby kelly and boss i knew we're

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.840
friends with her yeah plugged me in so i

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.360
was like hey tell judy she can call me

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:41.919
whenever

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:44.960
yeah oh she actually did after like four

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.000
days

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.520
if she would have got me the day of that

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.200
would have been a different conversation

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.640
the day i called bobby kelly i was like

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.640
that [ __ ] bit like i was furious

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.840
because it just came out

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.840
yeah yeah and i finally i was right to

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.120
be mad at one of these people like

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.000
because all these again

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.440
all these other comics saying [ __ ] on

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.200
podcasts i can't get mad

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.840
you genuinely can't yeah it'd be so

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.640
hypocritical

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.720
sure but when somebody writes an article

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.240
to cnn

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.400
that's different yeah especially because

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.640
she's i've heard her on podcast saying

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.159
ridiculous things that if they were

00:25:16.159 --> 00:25:17.520
taken out of context

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.080
you'd be like oh my god well yeah the

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.760
one of her screaming the n-word and

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.000
crashing she's like what is this music

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.760
there's like it's a hip-hop

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.440
and she's sitting there like this isn't

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.679
music and throwing in the n-word and

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:30.320
[ __ ] it's like

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.080
yeah listen i know what you were going

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.840
for you were trying to be funny i don't

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.440
think you should ever lose anything

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.120
but if i did something like that i would

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.960
never write an article to cnn

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.120
[ __ ] on someone who did something

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.559
one-tenth of what you just did

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:45.679
but everyone i've seen mostly

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:47.760
who had [ __ ] to say people instantly

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.880
were like what about this time you said

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.960
this and it was just like people like uh

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.159
yeah titus scrubbed a bunch of his

00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:54.159
tweets he deleted him

00:25:54.159 --> 00:25:56.640
people like two seconds were like bro he

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.520
hit like

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.799
four tweets that were just like oh my

00:25:58.799 --> 00:26:00.640
god this [ __ ] asian guy just crashed

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.279
what a [ __ ]

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:06.320
idiot i'm not mad at that guy

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.840
i'm not mad at any of these guys but

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.520
it's like of course

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.880
of course again you were saying it's

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.720
hypocrisy so so is it for them to be

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.360
like

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.559
i mean i just don't think [ __ ] like

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:16.159
that's a cheap [ __ ] it's like dude shut

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:16.640
up

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.080
yeah i do know that that you and me

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.440
would never go on the podcast be like i

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.799
just think that's a cheap shot

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:22.559
you never punch down i know we would

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:24.240
never fight it that way well it's also

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.760
crazy that you see like all these people

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.400
who are

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.919
like have been comics for 20 30 years

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:32.880
right and they have this like immediate

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.640
reaction to just that clip

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.640
and then you have andrew yang who's not

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.320
a comedian and he's like

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.320
well i watched like some like some of

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.600
his other stuff

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.880
yeah and like it didn't seem like

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.799
it was like that and it doesn't seem

00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:48.320
like he's like really angry or there

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.080
wasn't any malice so i just figured it

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.279
was like

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:52.799
he's actually kind of funny in the other

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:55.120
stuff it's just like how does this guy

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.720
understand how to approach this

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.880
situation more than everyone else well

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.360
he's

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.039
played in a different game too i i can't

00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:02.799
get out of my weird little

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:05.440
i know exactly yes but sure he seems

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.880
like the man he seems like the man don't

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:07.919
you dare batman no no

00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:09.919
i love yang on this castle think about

00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:11.679
it only support the yang man we do

00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:14.080
but i'm saying i'm a strategist so even

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.279
for him i'm sure he

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:16.960
watched it was like yeah this guy's fine

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.960
not a total [ __ ] that was sick for him

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.000
because it's like

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.480
he's he's trying to pilfer trump

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.600
supporters that's worse that's true

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.399
that's a basic

00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:26.320
even if he arrived at that through you

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.679
know some like

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:30.000
sort of political sure i'm not hating on

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.360
him it's still the right take

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.039
it is it is and it was a way more

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:35.120
nuanced and better i totally understood

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.880
this from talking to him which was funny

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.279
because

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:40.480
when they he was like i'm not saying i

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.919
declined sitting down or anything but

00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:42.960
like

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.640
that was an option yeah i could go sit

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.080
down and talk to him and all like

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.000
you know all the management agents and

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.679
all that [ __ ] were like he remember he's

00:27:49.679 --> 00:27:51.760
a politician he could try and

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.600
trap you into sayings and i'm like i

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.720
talked to him on the phone a couple of

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.440
times he's

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.520
like genuinely seems like a [ __ ] good

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.480
dude yeah yeah

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.840
i don't see him as like a career

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.000
politician weasel yeah

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.679
like i genuinely was talking to him and

00:28:03.679 --> 00:28:05.679
he's he's kind of running on the fact

00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:06.399
that he's not

00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:08.240
yeah exactly yeah he's running on like a

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.679
good guy trump type thing

00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:11.120
yeah it's like yeah i'm not one of those

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.039
guys yeah well populist instead of being

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:13.679
a [ __ ]

00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:15.120
populism is the only way for the next i

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.640
think 15 years that people are gonna get

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.840
elected but the

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.520
yeah i don't think i've had this weird

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.360
thing i've noticed from this that like

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.000
i'm constantly picking apart people's

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.360
agendas so i'm like yeah well he's

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.720
[ __ ] this is what he was up to

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.159
which is just some weird [ __ ] that i do

00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:30.960
i've been doing that my whole life

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.960
yeah i do it too man i constantly i'm

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.480
like why is this [ __ ] doing this

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.120
yeah for real

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.480
what the [ __ ] he want out of this

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.440
that's just when i was in the

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.720
[ __ ] streets for so long i

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.520
remember that in like

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.960
seventh grade i was on my way because in

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.720
seventh grade i'll go lyft with the high

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.520
school team

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.880
after school i'd drive over to high

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.399
school and live with them for football

00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:48.799
and

00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:50.960
my sister was driving me and one of the

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.240
players that was older was like a

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.279
[ __ ]

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:54.640
and i was like well he's this is why

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.840
he's doing it and she was like oh that's

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.200
weird you think of it like that

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.120
yeah yeah yeah i love the stories of you

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.559
when you're little and just like

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:07.039
thinking of your weird [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:08.640
the teacher [ __ ] [ __ ] you up the

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.399
one time you carried out the plot

00:29:10.399 --> 00:29:12.240
yeah there's always that your young

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.840
thinking and reasoning is my one of my

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.360
favorites like machiavellian

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.480
yeah and it's also it's also just like

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.720
it is just taking the the whole like

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.559
human component out of it it's just like

00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:23.919
these are just

00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:26.159
this is like hot air moving to cold air

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:28.320
it's just like is that how wind starts

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.399
i think so the chamber's just in the

00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:32.000
passenger seat holding a skull and be

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.520
like i'll tell you what he's really up

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.679
to

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.679
yeah we had a we had a discussion about

00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:38.960
the wind

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.279
and how it's generated how do where does

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.720
wind come from do you know

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.919
uh i think it is just like pressure is

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:46.480
what i said

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.720
yeah it's like pressure and temperature

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.640
like mismatches so is it the weight

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.120
of earth just pushing down on stuff no

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.080
no no

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.840
pressure and hot air so that when cold

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.720
air meets the air is wind

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.760
right but so like when no bam no it's

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.240
not

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.919
no no when you have like a if you have

00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:06.399
like a hot room right in a cold room and

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:08.080
you opened up like a door between the

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:08.559
two

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:10.480
yeah it's like you can feel the air rush

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.080
in oh the air will try to move to where

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:12.559
it has to

00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:15.360
be the temperature yeah yeah heat rises

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.120
but here's here's my question okay so

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.039
air is the stuff all around us so i was

00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:20.880
like if there's no breeze

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.760
and i would run full speed i will create

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.279
a ripple movement of like

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:26.960
a gust basically that affects other

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.080
stuff which i was like that's [ __ ]

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:28.799
sick so i was

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:30.960
i was thinking wind comes from the earth

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.960
spinning

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.080
like a car window effect no i think

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.200
there is i know like the coriolis effect

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:39.520
like

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.120
you know how people think that like

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.120
toilets flush the other way in australia

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.360
they don't they don't okay but like the

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.360
i think i think hurricanes in the

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.960
southern hemisphere do

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.480
spin in a different direction that's

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.080
from magnets

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.240
i think there is something to that but i

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.760
i think that has something to do with

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.120
like the rotation of the earth

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.480
and now we're on the same page you bring

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.159
out some magnets there that's where

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:05.840
it comes from well dude from magnus

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.039
that's what uh terence howard also is

00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:11.039
working on a paper um

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:13.760
oh my god what is it tonal it's like

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.919
tonal therapy or something to where like

00:31:15.919 --> 00:31:17.919
he's claiming that you can rid the body

00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:18.960
of disease

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.279
through certain tones that like and do

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:22.799
that you have to watch the thing when he

00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:24.640
dresses an oxford but it's like

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.320
your dna is made up of he was like

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.720
carbon oxygen oxygen oxygen he was like

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.279
the g chord that's carbon that's the

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:32.000
same wavelength

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.159
as carbon here's like e chord so you hit

00:31:34.159 --> 00:31:35.679
these tones so you send

00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:38.640
tones at people's dna when the tones

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.760
when the

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.600
tone matches up with the element like

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.039
how they're they're representing the

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:44.080
save wave

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.880
same wave he said the dna squeezes

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.600
together

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.440
and tightens and then it releases and

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.120
like all the bad [ __ ] kind of releases

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.600
this is one of those ideas that's like

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.640
sounds absolutely [ __ ] absurd and

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.480
then you look into it and it does sort

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.039
of work

00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:01.039
dude i i was watching uh that's awesome

00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:02.640
dude i was watching

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.559
terry allergy dude you just got verified

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:07.840
just gave him the check mark on that

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.679
idea well no dude i

00:32:09.679 --> 00:32:11.679
i i would have i would have railed

00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:13.279
against that so hard but two nights ago

00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:14.799
i was watching like this documentary on

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:16.570
the mayo clinic

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.960
[Laughter]

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.720
and they were doing this guy was doing

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.720
um uh

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.480
this asian guy at the mayo clinic had

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.360
come up with

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.240
uh of asian descent where is he from uh

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.279
i don't know america

00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:36.399
don't guess uh from the bronx okay yeah

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:37.840
that's what everyone does just curious

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.600
yeah where are you from yeah uh

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.600
here yeah i [ __ ] know dude yeah yeah

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.799
yeah

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:44.559
uh that never happens it's like that's

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:46.320
all we did is kids where are you from

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:46.640
yeah

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.320
i'm from down the street no no are you

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.000
[ __ ] german or what are you yeah

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.840
yeah i know you were running around like

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.600
show me your papers are you german or

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.399
not

00:32:54.399 --> 00:32:57.840
what are you

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:08.120
[Laughter]

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.840
dad

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.840
still laughing i can't get off of justin

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.600
trudeau blaming black based on privilege

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.279
i talked about on the last patreon i

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.799
talked about the last podcast

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:22.640
bro that is the goal to get so papered

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.799
that your kid is just like out and

00:33:24.799 --> 00:33:26.159
[ __ ] halloween and blackface and

00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:27.600
you're just like

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.080
let's let him have fun man dude yeah

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:30.880
that is so

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.320
funny to be like yeah but i was so

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.240
[ __ ] rich but cool

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.519
yeah you know you're out you're checking

00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:38.880
papers no no i'm dead

00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:45.360
uh no then uh someone watching this

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.360
documentary and this dude is playing

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.360
like a professional violin player and

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.640
he's got this really bad

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.159
tremor right uh and this asian doctor

00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:54.880
guy

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.039
came up with this like deep stimulation

00:33:57.039 --> 00:33:59.440
therapy where he just puts like a thin

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.679
like wire into the guy's brain it's like

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:02.880
electrified

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.360
and uh like they had the guy had to be

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.000
awake during

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.760
the surgery they had like his skull open

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.040
and they were like shoved like a little

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:09.679
node in

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:10.879
yeah and they were like and they gave

00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:12.560
him the violin to play and he had like a

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.839
little bit of a tremor and they were

00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:15.200
like should we put another one in or

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.720
how's this feeling he's like

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.079
yeah this isn't good enough i mean just

00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:19.280
try another one and they put like

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.000
another one in

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.079
and then he was like perfect and it's

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:23.839
just like deep deep brain like

00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:25.679
electrical stimulation

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.679
so the matrix well let's just fix his

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.280
arm tremor that has nothing to do with

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.320
music being carbon well it's just like

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.879
that sort of like harmonic resonance

00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:36.159
kind of thing it's a wavelength

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.919
electric range it's hard to argue with

00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:39.599
something like harmonic resonance

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:40.800
if you say a word like that i'm not

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.320
going to be able to counter it i'm

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.919
telling you right now i just heard two

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:45.119
stories that have nothing to do with

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:46.720
each other the only common denominator

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.520
was music

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.040
stimulation in the form of a wave

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.800
yeah you're locked in the euclidean

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.040
plane dude sorry you're on the wrong

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:55.839
plane

00:34:55.839 --> 00:34:57.280
me and o'connor are in three-dimensional

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.359
space time you guys are on a bad plane

00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:02.480
spacetime's four you guys are on flight

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.599
you just gave me another dimension to

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:05.920
play with 4d space time yeah

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.040
so you think music chords are direct

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.960
in line with like elements so a g chord

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.560
is carbon well i don't know

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.400
that's what this guy's i don't know but

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.079
the vibrations you stimulate

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:18.160
from singing actually kind of like shake

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.760
up your brain stem and are like are good

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.359
for it like this is probably agree with

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:21.680
that

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.599
yeah so that's that in a way is tonal

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:25.440
therapy and you know that's a very basic

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:25.760
form

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.160
i can imagine coming up with a thing

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.040
where

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.640
it's like very isolated sound waves

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.560
that would destroy some type of disease

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.000
or something i could see that

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.040
rather than destroying that's like

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.480
there's i could see something to that

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.920
that's the thing is that like you hear

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.359
someone be like dude they're curing

00:35:41.359 --> 00:35:43.040
cancer with sound and you're like oh

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.000
come on

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.359
but then yeah we'll see they're doing it

00:35:47.359 --> 00:35:48.640
on some level

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.240
well no we'll never know for now we'll

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.599
never know we need terence howard to

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:53.119
keep pushing ahead dude now that he's

00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:54.079
not an actor

00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:55.599
we're all going to be living in [ __ ]

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:57.359
like body suits forever now that terence

00:35:57.359 --> 00:35:58.160
hector to quit

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.720
terence howard quit empire oh he quit he

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.000
quit acting altogether

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.880
pursue physics what you know we just

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.000
talked about terence

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.640
teriology his his math thing we talked

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.839
about on the last several talk about we

00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:11.119
talked about on that yeah before

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:13.280
we talked about it oh before you came

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.560
yeah yeah

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.000
he doesn't believe that one time he's

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.599
not here i'm gonna break it down

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:20.079
let's break it down again what's one

00:36:20.079 --> 00:36:21.760
times one

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.599
one yeah actually two dude

00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:26.960
you dumb [ __ ] it's actually two

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.480
according to terence howard one times

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.160
one equals two because you

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.920
you have two separate entities so you

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.599
have two one so how can two ones equal

00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:34.800
one

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.880
that that's his theory i mean that's

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.160
actually he doesn't understand

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.440
multiplication

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.200
he's like his base level that's what his

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.079
haters really [ __ ] yeah yeah

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:47.280
it's one thing one time sure one but

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.960
what if you times one dollar times one

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.480
dollar

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.079
that's his response that's it and then

00:36:54.079 --> 00:36:56.240
everybody's just as befuddled as you

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.040
no answer there at oxford and he was

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.720
like well physics he was like there's no

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.520
such thing as

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:02.960
you can't create or destroy matter so

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.800
you have two ones one of them can't just

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.359
go away

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:07.040
mathematics has to line up with physics

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.320
that's that's the best way to argue

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.520
though is like when you're like one

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.560
times one is

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.720
it's one they're like no what if it was

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.320
one times one dollar

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.040
and the other person's just like because

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.240
then they would literally have to

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:18.800
explain

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.440
all of math to you yeah yeah it's

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.720
literally it's like trying to talk to

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.320
it's my parents asking me questions

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.680
about what's happening with me

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.839
right like well what about your man are

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:30.000
there are the agents still

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.079
are you getting gigs yeah and i'm like

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:33.119
yes

00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:36.960
like well how you know

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.119
if we talk about this that i have to

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:40.400
literally start from

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.079
explaining everything to you and this is

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:44.400
how you do it this is how dumb i am it's

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.119
like

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:48.960
can you multiply a dollar times a dollar

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.400
well i used to have a joke was it just

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.800
one dollar times one

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.320
he was saying exactly that's what it is

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.000
yeah it's never times well then he's

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.960
saying that that's

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.400
a fake thing then he was like i'm

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.560
dealing in the realm of real things and

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.320
goods and tangible

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.839
there's no such thing as a fake number

00:38:03.839 --> 00:38:06.400
he's like that's basically a trick

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.400
i think there like actually are such

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.240
things as fake numbers or something

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.000
it's you know whatever i don't know it's

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.240
one of those things you watch like

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.359
he could come in here and [ __ ] us he did

00:38:17.359 --> 00:38:18.000
it to a up

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.680
full of people at cambridge yeah but

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.200
there's no way they were

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.560
people stepped up to him at the last

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.240
time he had like a real nice

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.680
walk off seriously he had a nice

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.440
walk-off answer and then

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.640
it probably wasn't a different major too

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.640
he had a nice walk-off answer and he's

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.839
alright that's my time he goes oh we got

00:38:31.839 --> 00:38:33.119
one more question he's like

00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:35.119
uh okay and the ladies like wait it

00:38:35.119 --> 00:38:36.960
starts breaking it down and he goes and

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.240
he slips out of it again he's like all

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.079
right guys i'm out of here thanks a lot

00:38:40.079 --> 00:38:41.680
pretty funny yeah i mean you're right

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.440
it's like yeah you wind up just having

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.240
to explain

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.680
everything like the nature of the

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.440
universe and then you can't but then

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.720
you're explaining and then he also

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.040
claims

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.599
we were talking about this how he has

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:53.359
been working on this for 45 years

00:38:53.359 --> 00:38:55.440
and he started in utero he remembers

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.880
thinking about like sacred geometry

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.839
while he was in europe

00:38:58.839 --> 00:39:02.000
yeah jesus [ __ ] christ yeah he's

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.240
speaking at cambridge

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.640
why why do they i think they're just

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.079
excited to have the guy from empire

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:10.000
well everyone was asking questions

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.359
they're like wait like so how are you

00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:12.880
like how does acting work and he was

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.960
like you know his

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.320
actors whatever he's like but i'm really

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.000
my real focus is on yeah

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.800
is on uh physics i'm a physicist do you

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.359
think he

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:22.800
tricked them he was like yeah i'll give

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.720
like an acting talk yeah and then

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.200
started talking math and then he was

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.040
like here i am at cambridge

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.040
talking mathematics tell me i'm not the

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.119
funniest part is he's like well you know

00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:34.560
this is my views on the teresian

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.359
universe

00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:36.720
uh i'd like for the people here at

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.320
cambridge i need you guys to kind of

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.920
look through and verify all my findings

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.040
you know get back to me so like

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.160
basically like here's a bunch of weird

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.599
[ __ ] i came up with

00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:45.280
do math and stuff and like figure it out

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.640
if it's real or not i'm like damn i

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.079
respect the [ __ ] out of that it's a good

00:39:48.079 --> 00:39:48.400
move

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.800
pure theoretician he's pure theory guy

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.599
yeah you could be

00:39:51.599 --> 00:39:53.680
he's like he's like i had a 1.4 he's

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.520
like i had a 1.4 in college

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.119
or in high school he was like but i had

00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:58.720
other [ __ ] to do so

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.079
obviously i didn't have time to like go

00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:01.520
through the formality of like becoming a

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.720
mathematician it would have helped that

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.119
basic

00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:05.040
math would have helped it would have

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.560
helped us greatly we could have avoided

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.760
this whole thing he also

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.440
starts off by being like well you know

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.880
when i was young we were so poor i had

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.079
to wear a dress for two years because we

00:40:12.079 --> 00:40:14.800
didn't have any clothes

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.520
it doesn't check out either it's like

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.119
dude you couldn't like

00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:20.960
fashion some shorts out of that [ __ ] or

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.720
just something man or just stitch up the

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.319
middle of it and just have baggy pants

00:40:24.319 --> 00:40:26.880
have a [ __ ] jumper you have a romper

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.240
you gotta take it off to take a [ __ ]

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.560
[ __ ] hot girls get naked to

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.680
[ __ ] that's the best thing about romper

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.040
is just knowing all those babes are

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.480
getting ass naked to dump

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.240
well they also girls like won't [ __ ] for

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.160
like three days yeah they do that girls

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.520
are weird about dumps

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.880
dude i uh real weird i was watching uh

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.960
i've been watching a lot of

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.000
documentaries

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.520
that was weird i was watching uh because

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.680
i don't know anything about france

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.680
like its whole history yeah i'll tell

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.830
you and i was watching uh

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:57.200
[Laughter]

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.800
i was watching documentary about louie

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.720
the 14th

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.319
what did he do what the [ __ ] he built

00:41:02.319 --> 00:41:03.839
versailles okay

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:08.079
nice and um yeah he was uh

00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:11.440
he who [ __ ] so much that like his main

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.160
lady invented like a different type of

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:14.960
outfit

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.960
that she could take off really quick

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.800
because if she had if she had to like

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.240
spend a lot of time taking her clothes

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.680
off he would just like [ __ ] other girls

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.560
that were like just

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.319
in the waiting or laying around yeah

00:41:24.319 --> 00:41:25.680
yeah yeah like hurry up

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.119
and so she was like [ __ ] i want to be

00:41:27.119 --> 00:41:28.880
the one who's getting [ __ ] so i gotta

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.480
develop this like new style this like

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.800
tunic that i can just like rip off

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.200
yeah that's crazy and you know what like

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.680
it was like a french documentary and

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.400
it was so full of [ __ ] like i don't know

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.599
i don't know if like

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:43.440
other countries are so like insecure

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.720
about like where they are that they

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.400
can't sort of like talk [ __ ] about their

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.839
leaders like they haven't gotten to that

00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:49.200
stage of the documentary

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.560
because they kept being like louie i

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.400
mean louis xiv was like

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.960
hot and charismatic and like he was just

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.560
like the hottest dude on earth he was

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.400
like the perfect embodiment of a king

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.119
and then they like

00:41:59.119 --> 00:42:00.640
start breaking down his childhood it's

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.160
like he lost all his hair when he was

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.440
like 13.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.839
he was not sick he was like he was like

00:42:05.839 --> 00:42:07.520
yeah like dudes would have to check his

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.720
[ __ ] every morning because he

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.800
constantly had tape worms like garbage

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.240
was like i don't know

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.839
i think this guy might have been like

00:42:14.839 --> 00:42:17.839
ugly bradley cooper

00:42:17.839 --> 00:42:19.440
it just goes to show you how there's all

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.160
this like relationship building but

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.480
or you can just become so rich and

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.920
powerful that you just have chicks

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.359
laying around on a marble floor and

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:28.480
you're like

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.920
just walk around just [ __ ] them all like

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.359
hurry up i'm gonna [ __ ] this girl until

00:42:31.359 --> 00:42:32.400
you get dressed that's what i was going

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.200
for

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.960
that's exactly what i was going for now

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.240
you have to like communicate and

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:36.880
honestly

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.280
and [ __ ] you to develop that sucks i was

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.800
so close to just being like done

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.040
first product yeah this is me for the

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.480
next 30 well

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.520
10 years i'm dying soon you popped out

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.880
of the microwave you're like i'm ready

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.079
no no no put you in the toaster back in

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:55.040
toss you back in

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.800
you have more to work on now i hear i am

00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.359
growing

00:42:59.359 --> 00:43:00.720
that's awesome you gotta grow it's all

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.640
about groceries it's about growth dude

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.319
and i feel like if if things would have

00:43:04.319 --> 00:43:05.760
been good for me

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.079
i wouldn't have grown and here i am dude

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:09.280
just growing more and more

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.960
growing even more as soon as i saw the

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.480
light i was blinded by it back to the

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.119
darkness

00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:15.599
for sure

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.480
yeah that is that's definitely something

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.319
that i would say for sure keeps me from

00:43:20.319 --> 00:43:21.200
killing myself

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.040
just curiosity being like yeah i wonder

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.319
what happens yeah yeah

00:43:24.319 --> 00:43:26.000
of course that's the worst thing about

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.839
dying you don't know what happened

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:29.599
yeah you don't know what happens next

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:31.200
exactly unless you do get to go to

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.480
heaven and chill

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.400

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.680

straight right into the clouds

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.560

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.319
come from all the angels

00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:45.440
flapping their wings for sure i think

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.880
how many angels they've lost their wings

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.319
the day you got [ __ ] publicly

up in heaven when they found out the

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.319
decree down on earth and you're like

00:43:52.319 --> 00:43:54.720

a sub threshold where you're not like oh

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.559

so i think i have to take mine down a

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.720
little bit so funny that shayna just

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.000
[ __ ] sabotaged him lost him

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.720
so dude how he took them all the first

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:13.039
time

01:07:13.039 --> 01:07:15.039
well it was just one day by you're

01:07:15.039 --> 01:07:16.240
supposed to wait like it's one

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.240
two days off one day he was taking him

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.839
every day and i'm like what the [ __ ]

01:07:19.839 --> 01:07:23.280

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.319
trill and then he lost him allegedly

01:07:26.319 --> 01:07:28.000
yeah i just been munching them down

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.280
right now what the [ __ ] going on it

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:32.160
might be a little tight on rent

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.880
mushroom pills

01:07:36.319 --> 01:07:40.000
yeah yeah yeah fib dollar piece i guess

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.079
yeah 20 bucks oh you could i guess you

01:07:42.079 --> 01:07:43.200
could i don't think he would do that no

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.319
he didn't tell him no i think he's

01:07:44.319 --> 01:07:44.960
probably gonna

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.559
think he got [ __ ] hammer and took him

01:07:46.559 --> 01:07:48.319
yeah

01:07:48.319 --> 01:07:49.680
yeah exactly he's like how the [ __ ] do

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.520
you lose those he could i mean it's

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.720
shayna he just

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.680
put him down yeah yeah could like fought

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.119
about i don't need to slander the boy

01:07:57.119 --> 01:07:57.680
but yeah

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.960
if shayna could have fought a bum and

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.119
had them stolen from him it is funny

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.079
that he was like

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:05.920
could i get a more

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.200
a third [ __ ] time jesus

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.680
sorry to interrupt this no no no no but

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.480
yeah that's the uh

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.880
yeah i would love it i would love you i

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.640
would love shane do the micro it's

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.719
it is tough though during like uh this

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:20.239
is a trying time and i'm like

01:08:20.239 --> 01:08:22.000
yeah it's not the best time for this but

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.440
it also kind of is because if you think

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.719
about them it's just like a supplement

01:08:24.719 --> 01:08:25.920
you don't get hung up on like

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.359
in my high am like this if you just kind

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.520
of go through it it's pretty tight

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.359
yeah but it does it does leave you

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:33.359
really like wanting it

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:36.400
every day that's you

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.319
yeah maybe yeah that's interesting but

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:40.000
i'm the same way in the exact same way

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:40.400
but yeah

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.839
but you physically the cool thing is you

01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:43.679
can't like you you

01:08:43.679 --> 01:08:45.199
you you have to let your serotonin kind

01:08:45.199 --> 01:08:46.799
of replenish i know there's no chance

01:08:46.799 --> 01:08:48.080
that if i had

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.040
a bag of 21 of those no i'm not taking

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:51.279
them

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:53.839
really like all of them really yeah yeah

01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:54.560
i would get wow

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.400
i would get drunk i would take like four

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.239
yeah this isn't doing anything

01:08:58.239 --> 01:09:01.040
three more yeah and then i would wait

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.960
until i got high as [ __ ] on mushrooms

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.400
that's funny as far as i'd have to do

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.839
that that's yeah that's interesting it's

01:09:05.839 --> 01:09:07.199
kind of like yeah i don't know it's just

01:09:07.199 --> 01:09:07.839
like

01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:10.080
i think that's what happened you think

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.679
some of the other characters

01:09:11.679 --> 01:09:13.359
for me it's like i'll take them and it's

[ __ ] japan

getting rained on but you know it's like

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.000
on some level you're like it must have

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.159
been nice to have purpose

01:12:18.159 --> 01:12:20.640

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.960
it must have been nice it's nice to have

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.040
purpose yeah yeah i people lack it i

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:25.679
think

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:28.000
totally totally totally lack it it's my

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.440
life talks about it with my friends like

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:30.960
when they're like i was driving with my

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:31.600
friend

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.520
to a show like some comedy competition

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.880
in baltimore and he was like

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.600
damn i wish i had this yeah like just

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.480
something to

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.760
[ __ ] go compete and wreck yeah

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.560
yeah you can you can of course that's my

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.360
life's work

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.640
is trying to help instill that in the

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.400
masses they need yeah

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.440
because if they don't have it they just

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.199
write articles about like the state of

01:12:51.199 --> 01:12:51.920
comedy

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.320
yeah man yeah that's his purpose

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:59.280
they've got to destroy them true well

01:12:59.280 --> 01:12:59.679
that's

01:12:59.679 --> 01:13:01.760
that's i know we're still on this topic

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.040
and this sucks sure

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.159
i think i'm going to talk about it for a

01:13:04.159 --> 01:13:06.840
while probably like five years at least

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.840
[Laughter]

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.719
like five to ten but uh that is their

01:13:12.719 --> 01:13:13.280
purpose

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.800
they believe they're doing something

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.520
right yeah and i believe they believe it

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.600
yeah but there's a thing that there's so

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.040
there's purposes there's real purposes

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.880
that are like this is my inherent thing

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.120
i'm doing my thing i'm not like overtly

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.719
[ __ ] with people's [ __ ] and trying to

01:13:26.719 --> 01:13:28.159
like take [ __ ] off people

01:13:28.159 --> 01:13:29.840
i agree that's a real purpose then

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.239
there's just like these weird spike

01:13:32.239 --> 01:13:33.120
missions of like

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.120
man he why can he do that that's cain

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.640
and abel [ __ ] dude

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.880
they're [ __ ] they're kane dude you're

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.080
chill you're doing your thing and all of

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.120
a sudden some guys are like

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.400
[ __ ] rock you're near cliff and

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.480
they're like that's not a purpose that's

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.920
just them being spiteful little

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.480
[ __ ]

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.199
uh maybe there is the spitefulness well

01:13:49.199 --> 01:13:50.320
i guess yeah i guess in their head they

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:50.880
are like

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.480
do think yeah they're like he needs to

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.239
be thrown off that camera sure sure he's

01:13:54.239 --> 01:13:55.760
my duty to the rest of

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.000
true unkind true right well that's the

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.280
dangerous thing too so like when you

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.280
don't have an inherent purpose you start

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.120
taking these weird like predatory

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.640
missions where it's like i gotta destroy

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.199
this and

01:14:05.199 --> 01:14:07.360
it's like whoa dude yeah how about you

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.320
go to [ __ ]

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.520
put on a sweater and go to [ __ ]

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.159
church dude and relax

01:14:12.159 --> 01:14:14.159
jesus or just something dude you don't

01:14:14.159 --> 01:14:15.520
need to go around destroying people's

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.120
[ __ ] that's what's happened people

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.480
and dude it's funny because i was

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.320
working with uh i was working with the

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:20.960
freeze dude

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.800
it's uh the one guy that works with spud

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.000
and he said this and

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.280
it's true he was like women as they get

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.400
older

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.239
their new thing becomes like so they you

01:14:30.239 --> 01:14:31.520
know they they deal with kind of like

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.280
the death of their body in a way

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.880
and then it's replaced by this like

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.360
weird puritanical morality

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.199
a lot of times he's like a lot of women

01:14:39.199 --> 01:14:40.640
fall into that and like that becomes a

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.280
new thing and

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.400
they start like taking that out on

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.719
everybody yeah i think everyone kind of

01:14:44.719 --> 01:14:46.159
goes to like a bunch of people have

01:14:46.159 --> 01:14:47.600
their dreams die and then they start

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.280
taking it out on the people around them

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.880
yeah i think that that's probably like a

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:53.440
more universal like human thing

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.199
i just think yeah dudes you have a kind

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:58.159
of dudes though have like don't

01:14:58.159 --> 01:15:01.120
their youth isn't as kind of uh under

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.040
attack as women women's youtube

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.080
is under attack dude you're coming

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.760
yeah yeah when i'm smoking cigs and

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.480
spitting in your room

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.320
i just think they're doing the right

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.239
thing it's just the wrong medium

01:15:20.239 --> 01:15:21.600
what do you mean i mean it's just like

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.360
don't it's you want to make actual

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.199
progress somewhere it's like

01:15:25.199 --> 01:15:27.120
it's not in comedy these people didn't

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.280
do make real change somewhere

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.920
you know it's like this is how they view

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:32.320
it

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.199
for real uh us making these types of

01:15:35.199 --> 01:15:36.239
jokes

01:15:36.239 --> 01:15:38.159
they believe people listen to it and

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:40.239
think that that's okay to say

01:15:40.239 --> 01:15:43.440
and we see it to some extent online yeah

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.960
where people are trolling people

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:46.960
commenting on us by saying horrific

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.480
things yeah

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:51.520
and they believe where we represent that

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.719
yeah which i'm not saying i agree with

01:15:54.719 --> 01:15:56.000
them at all yeah but that's what they

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:56.480
believe

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.239
they think they're enacting actual

01:15:58.239 --> 01:16:00.080
change in society by shutting comics

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:00.719
down

01:16:00.719 --> 01:16:04.320
because we incite hate speech we incite

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.080
people to actually go out and say

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.239
things that we're saying well again i

01:16:08.239 --> 01:16:09.920
guess it's like to me it feels like

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.000
you know they have to worry about the

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.920
words because they're not making

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.640
real progress you know it's like yes

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.920
because they're not actually

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.199
fixing the thing yeah because they don't

01:16:21.199 --> 01:16:22.719
feel real progress they have to worry

01:16:22.719 --> 01:16:24.400
about like what words you're using yeah

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.000
and it's just like well

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.719
i know i think carlin has like a joke

01:16:28.719 --> 01:16:31.840
that's just like let's not talk

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.159
i don't like him i don't like it i was

01:16:34.159 --> 01:16:35.679
never really a big yeah yeah i never got

01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:37.120
into it i would have to look into him i

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.480
like his older stuff when he comes down

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.480
he's like the big bang boom

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.760
is everything what the [ __ ] is this

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.679
yeah no i the thing is that i loot i i

01:16:47.679 --> 01:16:49.520
i go to school with these people they're

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:52.000
not a solutions oriented bunch

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.440
yeah they they're a lot of their stuff

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.280
and i understand the impulses behind it

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.360
but a lot of it revolves around the

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.520
feeling they get from

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.760
enacting their philosophy right so it's

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.920
kind of empty there's no solution really

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:08.159
it doesn't really help anything but they

01:17:08.159 --> 01:17:09.280
feel good

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.800
when they do that you know what i mean

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.159
yeah yeah it's kind of like an empty

01:17:12.159 --> 01:17:13.199
feel-good philosophy

01:17:13.199 --> 01:17:14.840
it's [ __ ] puritanism i mean they're

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.640
puritanical yeah they're just

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.960
it's re-popping up under this weird new

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.640
age morality thing yeah it's like you

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.000
know it's not like now it's not like

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.640
predestination in hell it's just like

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.159
you're pure acting you're

01:17:26.159 --> 01:17:29.120
you're enabling hate speech it's like

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.480
dude our podcast definitely attracts

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.199
that element

01:17:31.199 --> 01:17:34.480
big time but it's also we make fun of

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.760
and it's like dude if you're gonna

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.120
if these [ __ ] are floating

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.560
around on the internet i'd rather have

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.080
them in my i'd rather have them under my

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.040
auspices

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.800
like get in here get in here come on

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.560
chill let's try it maybe we can [ __ ]

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.040
uh

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.600
you know lighten it up take it easy yeah

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.120
yeah [ __ ] relaxed

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.560
so it's like but it's also they have

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.320
[ __ ] you know they've on their own

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:52.640
you know

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.880
on their side on the side of their [ __ ]

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:56.400
there's people doing death threats and

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.760
[ __ ] it's just nobody cares

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.199
they're just like yeah [ __ ] those guys

01:17:59.199 --> 01:18:00.320
yeah that's like yeah i'll be like you

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.760
know so it's like their [ __ ]

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.120
they have a very similar element that

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.120
goes live i mean that was my argument

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:05.600
was

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.440
i was talking to somebody and they he

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.199
was talking about people in my orbit

01:18:09.199 --> 01:18:12.000
saying horrible things and how i'm

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.199
responsible for that

01:18:13.199 --> 01:18:14.480
and i was like what about everybody that

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.480
said horrible things to us yeah

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:19.120
or to me are you responsible for that

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:19.600
yeah

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.040
because i'm literally getting people

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.800
sending me death threats

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.280
not that i think they're real sure but

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.280
if i was a whiny [ __ ] i could be like

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.199
i'm i'm getting actual death threats

01:18:29.199 --> 01:18:32.000
right now is seth's is he against

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.400
rap then because you don't think rap

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.320
engenders violence and violence against

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.480
women where's the crusade against that

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.239
well come on you know the answer well

01:18:40.239 --> 01:18:41.760
again if he was this guy is like

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.719
really pursuing social change and it's

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:46.239
i'm telling you it's empty

01:18:46.239 --> 01:18:48.880
it's [ __ ] and it's like i i'm true

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.080
every time i'm in class

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.640
i'm like well what do you guys propose

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.000
we're talking about a place that

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.960
like holds young boys you know like

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.560
juvenile age boys who

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.159
go on probation and parole and get in so

01:19:00.159 --> 01:19:01.600
much trouble that their parents are like

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.320
no more

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.520
and they got to be housed in like

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.280
detention units so we're talking about

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:06.320
this place and people like

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.159
it's just that place is someplace that's

01:19:08.159 --> 01:19:09.600
really brutal like that and it's like

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.320
well

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.840
how the [ __ ] would you run a facility of

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.360
100 juvenile delinquents

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.800
yeah yeah like what would it look like

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.400
if you gave them full control it would

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.760
be a [ __ ] disaster

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.199
right so it's like yeah of course it's

01:19:19.199 --> 01:19:20.320
like they're it's kind of the stuff's

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:20.800
puma

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.320
punitive it's not like trauma informed

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.760
and all that but it's like to go and

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:24.640
critique it with

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.120
no solution or even like well maybe try

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.560
this rather than like it's brutal and

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.000
it's like what would you do

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.760
they're instantly like i mean i would

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.360
just you know obviously

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.040
it's like shut the [ __ ] up then yeah

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.719
shut the [ __ ] up and also uh

01:19:36.719 --> 01:19:38.560
i'm sorry i'm so good this is off topic

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.600
but somebody commented because like

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.880
and i got to stop reading the [ __ ]

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.520
comments and i've been working on it

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.159
um somebody was they were talking about

01:19:48.159 --> 01:19:48.880
how

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.000
we took the path that was like

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.679
particularly me being like no i

01:19:53.679 --> 01:19:55.040
understand i forgive

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.640
not forgive but like i understand why

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.440
they did what they did and i'm not upset

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.600
and i'm just gonna move on and people

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.719
were like you can't just move on you

01:20:02.719 --> 01:20:04.640
gotta [ __ ] confront this

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.239
you gotta can't you can't just move and

01:20:06.239 --> 01:20:08.639
it's like i can't confront it yet

01:20:08.639 --> 01:20:10.639
i'm going to who's saying that like oh

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:11.760
people being like

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.000
shame on you is that enough kind of

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.679
being like all right so the guy used an

01:20:15.679 --> 01:20:16.960
analogy of like

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:19.040
yeah you can't so i said it's like i

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.960
can't be mad at a snake that just bit me

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.120
sure that'd be ridiculous yeah of course

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.080
it's in its nature

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.520
but then somebody's argument was like

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.800
yeah then you gotta come back and kill

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.080
that [ __ ] snake oh okay

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.360
fight someone else it's the other thing

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.440
and i was like okay yeah maybe i'm gonna

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:32.000
go wait

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.719
until i get a [ __ ] gun like that and

01:20:34.719 --> 01:20:36.000
then i'll go kill it

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.760
maybe why don't you wait until i go arm

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.520
myself properly not actually murder

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.120
these people meanwhile seth simons is

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.880
like oh god

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.880
wait until i can build myself up enough

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.239
that i can actually crush these people

01:20:46.239 --> 01:20:46.719
sure

01:20:46.719 --> 01:20:48.719
and i'm that's what that's my purpose

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:50.159
yeah that's what i'm going to do

01:20:50.159 --> 01:20:52.159
and the way i do that might not be

01:20:52.159 --> 01:20:53.679
directly confirming them but just by

01:20:53.679 --> 01:20:54.800
doing well

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.960
yup that's a total off time you're

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.320
talking a long game you're talking long

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.159
this is all long game talking long game

01:21:00.159 --> 01:21:00.719
dude

01:21:00.719 --> 01:21:02.159
absolutely and it also it's like you

01:21:02.159 --> 01:21:04.000
just you start to just if you don't do

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.600
that you start to just like

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.719
just continue this back and forth

01:21:08.719 --> 01:21:11.360
people like comedy civil wars yeah it's

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:15.040
a losing battle for you dude

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:21.600
everyone's [ __ ] sick of it and then

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.040
the fact that you handled it too like

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.639
you like didn't necessarily come out and

01:21:24.639 --> 01:21:24.960
beg

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.199
you like beg for clemency people were

01:21:27.199 --> 01:21:29.120
probably like yeah [ __ ] this

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.040
yeah yeah yeah so yeah it's like and it

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.400
it's a lose-lose for you because if

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.520
you're like

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.120
[ __ ] this it's like now you're gonna

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.600
just be aligned in a way that you don't

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.480
necessarily

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.440
yeah want which is fair and again it

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.400
goes back to like

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.120
me thinking about how people handle

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.000
trump

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.360
yeah i don't think that's how you win

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.679
this by going out and being like

01:21:49.679 --> 01:21:51.760
the president's a cheeto it's like no

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.280
that's not it yeah making

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.440
other people like him yeah the same

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.560
thing with this

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.480
it's like i'm not going to go back and

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.320
be like this is free speech dude suck my

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:00.719
dick

themselves out yeah

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.080

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.440
i had high hopes for uh

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.800
people our age not falling in all this

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.159
political [ __ ] and it's like we're

01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:12.639
an interview

01:23:12.639 --> 01:23:14.719
harder than ever yeah that meme harder

01:23:14.719 --> 01:23:17.360
than ever dad forward email thing was oh

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:17.760
dude

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.520
on the last in the episode we just did

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.040
he was like you'd say

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.000
sorry no it was basically like i was you

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.280
know you see like did your dad ever get

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:27.520
like the political chain emails

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:31.120
no that's not white trash so like my dad

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.880
and his boys would get like these emails

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.159
of like

01:23:34.159 --> 01:23:36.000
just like some [ __ ] of like george bush

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.320
like standing on like the taliban or

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.360
something just like some

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.520
[ __ ] and then i would see them

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.040
here's an idea it'd be like

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.080
obama like using the umbrella for

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.520
himself and not the soldier standing

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.159
there

01:23:48.159 --> 01:23:50.560
and there'd be a split picture of trump

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.320
like fixing the hat of a marine and be

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:52.639
like

01:23:52.639 --> 01:23:54.639
this is how president acts yeah you

01:23:54.639 --> 01:23:56.960

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.080
this out

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.159
my dad would get texts and emails my mom

01:24:04.159 --> 01:24:06.080
gets them too if like

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.920
this the [ __ ] white house is about to

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:09.280

people

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.920
sharing some like some article would be

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.920
from like libertynews.com and you're

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:48.480
like dude

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.080

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:51.920
yeah yeah yeah politicus

usa or something like yeah one of those

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.760
yeah yeah yeah yeah like political smack

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.120
or like one of those things that's like

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.120
almost an actual like newspaper it's

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.000
like the new york times

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.120
[Laughter]

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.760
yeah man we missed new york we missed it

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.600
we had it we had our chance i think the

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.719
thing that [ __ ] people up was like

01:25:10.719 --> 01:25:12.800
that marketing executives have been

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.320
trying to figure out how to market to

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.679
millennials forever

01:25:15.679 --> 01:25:17.280
and they finally figured out that if you

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.040
can make them feel active

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.719
like they're making a difference all

01:25:20.719 --> 01:25:22.800
over i watched a website launch off this

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.400
it's called hunto.com now it's called

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.280
something else

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:27.199
i used to write for it and the original

01:25:27.199 --> 01:25:28.639
thing was like what kind of causes are

01:25:28.639 --> 01:25:30.239
you interested in share them on facebook

01:25:30.239 --> 01:25:30.639
and kids

01:25:30.639 --> 01:25:32.639
people like i love world hooker calls

01:25:32.639 --> 01:25:33.920
and they would share all this stuff

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.040
he got crazy [ __ ] uh a ton of

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.880
traffic and then he started putting up

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.400
like the doing the viral video thing

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.000
where like websites could just put up

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.600
youtube videos and then write a caption

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.639
and put them out to people

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:45.920
right right dude the guy was paying me

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.120
like a couple hundred bucks a week to do

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:47.760
this and he was

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.199
getting like hundreds of thousands of

01:25:49.199 --> 01:25:51.520
people because the thing was you could

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.520
shine go onto this website and then show

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.960
your friends what kind of

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.040
activism causes you're into right and it

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.960
blew up dude so fast and he's like yeah

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.400
i'm gonna switch it into like a video

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.239
blog now that i have my numbers

01:26:02.239 --> 01:26:04.400
it made no sense yeah man that's how

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.679
they figured out how to do it dude and

01:26:05.679 --> 01:26:06.880
people now that's all they have is like

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:07.360
well that's

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.280
also a thing that we like is tough

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.719
because like let's say we're talking

01:26:10.719 --> 01:26:12.080
about how it's funny

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.600
that nike is selling like look at this

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:16.960
[ __ ] hijab

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:20.000
yeah for all you [ __ ]

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.040
it's like dude we are not bashing

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.760
the [ __ ] 10 arab girls that need to

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.280
wear this to go fencing

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.199
yeah we would never bash that we're

01:26:29.199 --> 01:26:31.040
bashing the fact that this corporation

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.639
is so blatantly pandering

01:26:34.639 --> 01:26:36.480
are you allowed to wear like a branded

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.239
hijab

01:26:38.239 --> 01:26:40.080
yeah i feel like it's like against

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:41.679
muslim rule to charge interest yeah they

01:26:41.679 --> 01:26:42.400
just got to be

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.080
covered really so they wouldn't care

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:45.760
about having like wear like floral

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.840
stuff but a sponsored corporate

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.800
sponsored his job

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.560
that sounds exactly like it's against

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.920
like anti-religious

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.080
i mean yeah they got that [ __ ] one no

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.239
false idol rule too

01:26:56.239 --> 01:26:58.000
i don't yeah that's exactly what a false

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.199
idol is like you couldn't have like a

01:26:59.199 --> 01:27:01.040
yamaka with like

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.040
yeah well you've got a gucci i've seen

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:04.880
some yarmulkes with like mj symbols like

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.560
the michael jordan logo really like yeah

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:06.960
dude

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.320
that's sick it's for them it's for

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.560
moderate muslims who who don't to

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.480
subscribe to that crazy stuff but also

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.520
want their way but it's also

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.679
it's not for them it's for nike yeah

01:27:15.679 --> 01:27:16.800
they're they're

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.120
modern

01:27:21.199 --> 01:27:24.159
yeah yeah i might start fencing so like

01:27:24.159 --> 01:27:25.360
when we started

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.800
and that's one thing that like

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:28.000
throughout this whole thing has been

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.600
totally misconstrued is that

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.600
they think like people hear that on the

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.120
left and are so [ __ ]

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:35.120
blinded by it that they're like these

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.480
guys are [ __ ] racist

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:39.679
they hate muslim fencers she said no

01:27:39.679 --> 01:27:42.239
yeah we're making fun of nike for doing

01:27:42.239 --> 01:27:43.760
that yeah

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.520
and it's and and the fact that someone

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.880
out there is like you know what nike is

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.840

i'm a world merger so it's like i get

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.080
what people are saying but i also like

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.239
dude louise bits where he like

01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:26.480
his n-word bits are funny yeah i was

01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:27.520
explaining this to my girlfriend i was

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:28.159
like no no

01:32:28.159 --> 01:32:30.000
like it can be like so if someone said

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.679
that n word would be funny i'm like

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:33.040
yes i'll show you a clip right now

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.040
louise i'll introduce you to my uncle

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.159
hilarious

01:32:36.159 --> 01:32:39.360
it's funny yeah uh it's also that

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:40.960
i think we may have said it last week

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:42.480
dude it's my favorite argument this

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:43.199
whole time

01:32:43.199 --> 01:32:44.639
there's been like what if he said the

01:32:44.639 --> 01:32:46.880
n-word instead of making fun of uh

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.000
asians yeah it's like uh yeah

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.760
what if someone said that they're like

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.280
big [ __ ] different someone said that

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:54.480
they're like whoa i never thought about

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.760
it that way

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.840
but it's like what also makes them sound

01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:00.000
like bigots

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.600
yeah true originally they were like well

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:03.120
i was okay with that but well

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:05.280
yeah yeah yeah you're wrong yeah

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.639
interesting it's like wait

01:33:06.639 --> 01:33:08.639
so you're [ __ ] up yeah yeah but you're

01:33:08.639 --> 01:33:09.920
like what are they different that's the

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:10.960
thing now like what is

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:13.760
this one slightly less worse yeah which

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.600
i would argue it kind of is

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.400
you're [ __ ] sure you can't say for a

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:19.360
second that it's not

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.120
yeah and then because then you can be

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:22.639
like all right say mick

01:33:22.639 --> 01:33:24.159
call me a mick and then i'm like what if

01:33:24.159 --> 01:33:26.080
you said the n word instead

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:27.760
well i never thought of it that way but

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:29.120
then they have to be like no

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.440
asians are worse than or you're worse

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.239
you know

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:33.760
like that then they have to admit that

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.880
well then they start doing all this

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.080
funny math they're like well

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.679
they're a protected class and it's like

01:33:37.679 --> 01:33:39.280
the i love them people are like asians

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.159
make more money

01:33:40.159 --> 01:33:41.440
i know you keep hearing that argument

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.600
it's like chill chill don't do that

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.199
yeah but yeah you also hear that yeah

01:33:45.199 --> 01:33:46.960
never mind come on i should also be on

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.080
there right now

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.760
i hear a lot of uh it's funny to hear so

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.000
many asian comics be like as a person of

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:52.800
color

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.760
it's like dude what are you doing yeah

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.360
what are you doing why are you trying to

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:58.320
say you're

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:01.760
that yeah also it's like why the framing

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:03.920
statement like why this yeah

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:06.080
somebody say what you [ __ ] think and

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.679
then you know back it up

01:34:07.679 --> 01:34:09.360
as soon as someone says as they

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.520
something i'm like well this um this is

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.360
this is a dis genuine kind that's how i

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.800
feel right right right this genuine

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:15.440
conversation

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:18.000
sometimes it isn't but because it's just

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:18.960
sort of been like

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:20.400
it's like they think that that's like a

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.000
normal way to start a sentence when

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.080
white dudes do it i'm particularly like

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:26.320
oh man yeah when white people are no

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.440
matter what

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.960
on this i probably shouldn't you know

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:31.199
tell my place to comment the person

01:34:31.199 --> 01:34:33.440
i had a phone call with about this whole

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:34.239
situation

01:34:34.239 --> 01:34:36.560
said that to me well i was two white

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:37.440
dudes i don't think we're going to

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.199
really move the needle on race relations

01:34:39.199 --> 01:34:40.639
with this conversation

01:34:40.639 --> 01:34:42.560
and i was like i think white dude to

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:44.080
move the needle on some things and he

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:45.520
was like

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:46.639
i'm not going to get into that with you

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:47.920
and i was like never mind but what are

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:48.960
you talking about what the [ __ ] are you

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:49.280
talking

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.280
about what did we say that for well also

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:53.199
it's like we're different types of white

01:34:53.199 --> 01:34:54.400
dudes

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.000
so like you know if that guy's like well

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.199
that's two white guys it's like yeah

01:34:57.199 --> 01:34:59.040
well our lives are vastly different dude

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.719
so get the [ __ ] out of my face yeah

01:35:00.719 --> 01:35:02.159
yeah i always hated that people were

01:35:02.159 --> 01:35:04.400
like uh white people can't decide what's

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:05.040
racist

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.119
it's like i know but it is a

01:35:07.119 --> 01:35:08.800
conversation

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.880
yeah like it is a die like you tell me

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:11.920
what's going on with you

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:14.639
i tell you what's going on with me we

01:35:14.639 --> 01:35:15.040
like

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.440
meet somewhere like it is a dial because

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.520
you you can't just decide

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.600
yeah on your own either no one can

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.040
unilaterally decide

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.239
what you have to do this is all you have

01:35:24.239 --> 01:35:25.920
to do if you're a white person and all

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.040
you have to do is

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.280
put your preferred pronouns in your bio

01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:30.239
and then blast

01:35:30.239 --> 01:35:33.119
lizzo and you're set you're free yeah

01:35:33.119 --> 01:35:34.560
you're out of the conversation true yeah

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.760
you don't even have to worry about any

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:36.880
guilt

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:39.280
pronouns say how much you love lizzo and

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.080
your bio

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.520
you're set yeah but then you get caught

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:43.119
not held accountable well they're caught

01:35:43.119 --> 01:35:43.440
like

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:45.119
jamming out to leonard skinner people

01:35:45.119 --> 01:35:46.639
like this guy's a fraud

01:35:46.639 --> 01:35:49.920
we got him yeah but it's also like uh

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:52.960
it allows white people the supreme

01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:55.119
i think this might be the most yeah it's

01:35:55.119 --> 01:35:56.000
like the supreme

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.400
joy of they get to still flex that

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.719
racist muscle against other white people

01:36:00.719 --> 01:36:02.719
while somehow pushing themselves away

01:36:02.719 --> 01:36:03.840
from like this

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.840
teeming mass that is their guilt built

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.040
into their identity they're like and i'm

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.239
not one of the bad ones

01:36:08.239 --> 01:36:10.560
but they're pieces of [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.080
yeah so it's like it's kind of the

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.480
weirdest mutation of racism

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:16.000
to where they get to be like completely

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.600
disavow themselves of it and then be

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.800
like look at those sick

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.560
[ __ ] pieces of this she's been what

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.000
we've been

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.760
railing against since the start of the

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:26.080
podcast that's that's one more thing

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.920
that i've just been constantly having to

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.480
like

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:30.320
explain to people where this is coming

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:32.560
from yeah this is a podcast that start

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:33.679
that was incubated

01:36:33.679 --> 01:36:37.119
in a city where half the comedian

01:36:37.119 --> 01:36:38.719
suddenly became woke

01:36:38.719 --> 01:36:40.960
and shunned to the rest yeah and the

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.480
other half just like us saying

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.080

liberal racism type thing

01:36:50.159 --> 01:36:52.400
that's just so so apparent yeah it's a

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.440
very super so

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:56.960

national level yeah man

went to the doctor the other day

01:39:25.199 --> 01:39:27.280
how long ago how was it this was like

01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.040
two or three weeks ago

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.480
now the middle of the storm your blood

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.239
pressure's gonna be nuts yeah

01:39:32.239 --> 01:39:33.600
my blood pressure was like it wasn't

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.360
nuts it was like

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:39.280
uh it was like 133 over like

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:41.920
78 or something like that or 77 i think

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:43.760
i'd be celebrating that

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:47.280
which is like which is just outside of

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.199
like normal range but they took it they

01:39:49.199 --> 01:39:50.080
looked at it and they didn't say

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:51.040
anything to me and then i was like

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:52.320
looking at it online it was like yeah

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.679
you're starting to get some

01:39:53.679 --> 01:39:55.360
well they also changed the parameters

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.040
for high blood pressure

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.239
i don't know if you know that they they

01:39:58.239 --> 01:40:01.360
made it out of data a once accepted

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:02.560
it's [ __ ] it's blood pressure

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.080
medication that i think that's the

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.119
reason they did it because they're like

01:40:05.119 --> 01:40:06.719
it used to be one level and they bumped

01:40:06.719 --> 01:40:07.840
it up the thing that was considered

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:08.880
healthy and they're like

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:10.320
this is unhealthy you need you need

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.480
lipitor whatever at this level

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.080

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:18.239
it's [ __ ] [ __ ] for real it's

01:40:18.239 --> 01:40:19.440
[ __ ] [ __ ]

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:22.239
come on you know about it dude my dad
