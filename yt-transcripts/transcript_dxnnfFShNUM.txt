you were there yeah we started I've

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.270
watched him because me and butter we

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.180
were talking about eating just straight

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.620
mushrooms and I was like I [ __ ] hate

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.480
to taste you know even ever put on like

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.710
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.570
whatever I'm still gonna [ __ ] taste

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:30.240
it and he was just crushing yeah and

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.120
then Graham and we've been spread out on

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.250
the table and people were grabbing like

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.080
that and dude I remember being like nine

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:43.350
minutes into that being like we were in

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.030
this room so we're smoking joints and

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.980
[ __ ] so this room is hot box effect yeah

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.870
down two hours long

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.310
Sydney's munching mushrooms and it's

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.110
constantly hit as little [ __ ] young

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.820
one-hitter thing so there's two joints

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:59.820
going around at one point yeah it just

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.940
sounds exhausting it was also like we

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.340
were so we were only like edge of our

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.950
seats the entire time just like on and

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.960
like listening to the audio sounds kind

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.300
of clear but we were all like in crisis

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.660
the entire time I got a video that next

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.090
one dude dude I was gonna say I I would

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:18.720
think

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.240
alive one of those would be [ __ ] I

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.160
would also like to be one of the people

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.720
just to watch it from the outside

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.220
because I remember when we did it and I

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.660
was sitting there like I wonder people

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.250
were watching me what I'd be like right

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.150
now I'm just like yeah yeah what's worse

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.130
being in a tiny room or being like in

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.960
front of a crowd - you should do it like

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.610
a little glass room but they surround it

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.740
but you know what a [ __ ] silence art

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.620
exhibits in weird yeah well I was

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.660
thinking of trying to somehow organize

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.950
with like a space that would be cool

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.690
with it a thing where it's like you know

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.160
it's $10 to take it and then there's

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.050
just like a trough of just weed gummies

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.060
okay and get in and then it's like a

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.560
train goes around never know them pigs

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.720
out but it's like the whole audience is

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.280
that try to get like 100 people who are

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.800
just out of their gourd dude watch the

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.570
bunch of four people doing the stinkin

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.100
doing the same to all Batman

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.990
[ __ ] that would be Creole would be

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.090
crazy so sounds like [ __ ] like Timothy

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.730
Leary did in the 90s you want to see me

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.270
talk for 20 minutes everyone drop it

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.040
where you don't even know what sound is

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.250
exactly just get [ __ ] up I kinda want

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.110
to do that really badly you probably

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.550
find a place for that I think so without

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.380
a doubt especially in Philly yeah I

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.240
think yeah yeah yes it's tough

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.760
advertising that look I want to do a

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.110
thing I'm gonna put this out there

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.460
there's going to be a ton of weed

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.170
yummies but it's also you can do it you

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.700
can what you can do is advertise it so

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.260
it's just for medical patients I'm

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.360
saying like actually no pretty good

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.540
venue that would do it yeah but like I'm

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.970
just saying like bat mckusker configure

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.020
bat McCluster

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.880
yeah did you do it a good good

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:53.850
definitely yeah if you find a way well

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.040
you know what you could do is be like

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.440
you could hire a security guy yeah and

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.700
then be like yo you're checking

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.590
everyone's medical cards and then just

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.930
let him take the fall for it be like hey

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.930
like a liability contract basically hey

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.220
I need you to check the medical cards

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.410
and then his dick my [ __ ] guy gave me

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.120
a burner phone and never saw me yeah

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.800
yeah he's one of those fake [ __ ] weed

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:22.440
security tax returns see a season comes

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.780
Ave well you know what's going on oh

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.800

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.140
yeah how they're growing CBD weed yeah

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.600

bulk amounts of weed and I'll just be

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.980
CBD weed because it looks [ __ ] the

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.890
same as a regular life oh [ __ ] yeah so

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:41.850

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:57.240

five pack of CBD weed yeah

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.430
you basically just got robbed yeah so

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:12.630
they're talking about like high-level

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.220
black-market people pushing like 20

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.650
pounds of seaweed on a city and then now

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.000
everyone stops you every [ __ ] a

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.529

00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:26.540
that that was the you know what spice

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.040
that was basically like spiciness and

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.449
that it can happen yeah but it wasn't

00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:31.399
but I remember seeing like ads for it

00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:32.899
not only in like high taunted like you

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:34.610
know my buddy had a subscription to like

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.129
revolver like the metal magazine and I

00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:38.809
remember like seeing it like legal blood

00:13:38.809 --> 00:13:44.329
you could that was my boy had a [ __ ]

00:13:44.329 --> 00:13:46.040
really bad experience on that cuz he was

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.379
down in like Ocean City Jersey and he

00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:49.370
was with these girls that were passing

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.470
around that since it and [ __ ] he

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.749
smoked it and he goes dude rub that I

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:54.980
knew from the taste but I was like

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.050
whatever so I hit it like one maybe two

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.819
more times and then probably ten minutes

00:13:58.819 --> 00:14:01.100
into the ride I would not stop looking

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.899
behind me and like while we were driving

00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:03.949
because I was like dude the cops are be

00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:05.809
honest people are why any cars yeah I

00:14:05.809 --> 00:14:07.850
was like really like dude it was almost

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.230
like I was outside my body watching

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.170
myself wait the [ __ ] out and I could not

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.220
stop that Sara noia

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.170
the paranoia he said was like waves

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.199
coming in man my friend Burt smoked it

00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:22.009
in jail oh really oh yeah everyone who

00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:23.389
doesn't caught me now they drug test for

00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:24.589
it but it doesn't come up and drug test

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:26.420
yeah yeah so he smoked in jail with some

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.740
dude and he was saying it was like they

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.850
were sitting there and there was like

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.290
[ __ ] around like playing a board game

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.759
watching TV or something he said the guy

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:33.980
got up and was like do you hear that and

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.970
he's like all of a sudden I started

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.500
hearing our names over a loudspeaker and

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.139
like what he was like yeah it's well

00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:40.430
it's a synthetic cannabinoid so they

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.019
they take THC and it's tweaked it a

00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:43.189
little bit but that sounds like more of

00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:45.139
a hallucinogen than anything so it's

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:48.170
also it could be [ __ ] any like it's

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.149
kind of crazy cuz I didn't know anybody

00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:52.610
who ever had it like oh it's always ads

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.500
for it it's like Oh legal bugs I'm like

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.490
how could that curious as well all the

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:58.699
time

00:14:58.699 --> 00:15:00.110

00:15:05.149 --> 00:15:06.860

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.589
hours whenever dude I took a picture I

00:15:15.589 --> 00:15:16.850
think I sent it to you he was at his

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.600
desk like that's what you saw because he

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.189

cool they won't ask man

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:30.620
alright well ha ha all right - is now

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.120
like a street drug if you don't ignore

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.070
without it well they smell there I was

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.330
talking to a guy who was telling me that

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.010

oh oh they make it like a wet now now

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.300

like convulsing on the floor seriously

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.480
dead serious so I would scare the [ __ ]

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.490
on because it's like realizing you don't

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.559

00:19:57.559 --> 00:19:59.549
though when we watched everyone do this

00:19:59.549 --> 00:20:01.440

everyone do that

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.539
and I remember I hit it and as soon as I

00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:25.799

00:20:25.799 --> 00:20:27.779
not regular weed like this is not what

00:20:27.779 --> 00:20:29.909
I'm used to and I remember feeling in my

00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:32.999
left arm my hands start to twitch and

00:20:32.999 --> 00:20:35.429
all of my blood started feeling little

00:20:35.429 --> 00:20:38.100
squares and like slamming into one

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.029

00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:44.850
and I'm not lying I'm sitting and I'm

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.440
looking at Sean and Charlie because they

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.210

hear everyone laughing oh alright

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.609
I got a laugh too because I know I'm

00:21:02.609 --> 00:21:04.649
tripping like I know I'm tripping but

00:21:04.649 --> 00:21:08.779
like I got a laugh - dude I got a laugh

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:11.549
but I don't want to have a bad trip cuz

00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:13.080
in my brain I'm still doing that like I

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.820
knew a guy who turned into a glass of

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.830
orange juice cuz he's still had a bad

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.440
trip he's in on so I'm telling me so

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.269
just laugh dude everything would be cool

00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:23.340
if you just laugh yeah so I'm laughing

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.149
but as I'm laughing I can see like I'm

00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:30.419
like oh [ __ ] and then I slam my hands on

00:21:30.419 --> 00:21:32.850
the floor and when I do it splashes like

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.460
water and then I look up and all of the

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.950
laughter is seagulls flying around me

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.119
I'm always crying I don't like I am

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:44.039
[ __ ] tripping but like this is crazy

00:21:44.039 --> 00:21:47.070
and to keep in mind I've done acid I've

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.749
dropped acid Duntroon to a bunch of

00:21:48.749 --> 00:21:51.299
times I never had any visual like this

00:21:51.299 --> 00:21:52.980
picking up in my own we're lied to and

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.669
that's a shot I am like what the [ __ ] is

00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:59.489
happening and then in the distance I see

00:21:59.489 --> 00:22:01.950
a ship like a [ __ ] boat coming and I

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.929
look down I'm up to my waist in water

00:22:03.929 --> 00:22:05.999
I'm like I don't what the [ __ ]

00:22:05.999 --> 00:22:07.289
so I'm like starting this is wailing

00:22:07.289 --> 00:22:09.419
seagulls are like flying around and dip

00:22:09.419 --> 00:22:12.740
in the water and I'm just like haha

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.440

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.780
bottom so swimming to the ship and I'm

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.220
like watching people on the ship and

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.720
none of them have like I can't make out

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.760
any faces I just see people walking on

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.080
the gym like dozers I gotta get over

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.870
here dude all I could hear was laughter

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.090
okay cuz so I compare this kind of like

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.110
when you do

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.240
nitrous when you take a big oh ya know

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.420
you can hear but it's it wasn't the wall

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.210
right but it's obviously effective dude

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.950
it was just like I could just hear

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.130
laughter but it was like screech II bird

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.560

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.210
laugh dude I get to the boat like

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.380
putting my hands up oh my I can't

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.690
believe I'm actually doing this is this

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.280
insane I'm like it and part of me is

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.680

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.080

just do something where people like and

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.050

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:14.420
like quantum leap yeah so I'm just like

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.470

that's that's kind of stuff like that

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.510
well that's insane but like so it lasted

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.910

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.670

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.440
remember like putting my head down and

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.300

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.849
that's when you see guys you could give

00:39:27.849 --> 00:39:29.770
a [ __ ] about anything but then build an

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:32.829
entire complex you're like that's what

00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:33.700
America is

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.430

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:53.290
can do now is is make a body in the

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.940
ground but usually do like you know when

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:55.960

00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.660

you think about that it's like we don't

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:25.040
want our food to touch the [ __ ] everyone

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.260

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:30.140
a way it's Lou you know it's like we're

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.830

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.160
about in general like I don't care I

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.630
don't know it seemed it's just a strange

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:49.550
thing to be what's your layout of things

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:51.590
I guess it can only be kosher meats

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:53.210
I guess cuz he'll al is pretty similar

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.650
where it's blessed and cut a certain way

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:57.170
yeah and also I've which one is it

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:58.910
probably honestly there's probably

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:01.820
there's one without looking the animal

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.730
has the face towards wherever Mecca yeah

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.830
something like that and where they slice

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.300
the throat like that's what's considered

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.570
coach I may be talking or one of those

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:13.400
things is like a Oh deigned person who's

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.500
gonna it's basically just making sure

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.450
that someone who's like has there's a

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:18.980
religious right around the cleanliness

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:20.810
of how this movie process

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:24.200
like a whole tribe don't die yeah like

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.790
you just have like any idiot handling

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:27.560
all the meat everyone would die so

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.700
something that came from like there was

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.620
a guy like a special like super butcher

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:32.780
would just be like I bless this meat and

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.730
I did it right Wow

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:36.260
I don't even think like I remember like

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.970
learning about like cuz I worked in a

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:40.060
meat department for like a little bit at

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:44.110
supermarkets and I was like why is this

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:48.280
what can I get you who's next

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.530

burger grinder was amazing dude there's

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.130
nothing better than when it fat like a

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:56.930
lot of people don't know like everything

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:58.910
you see ground up is there it's done on

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:00.980
premises it doesn't show up that way so

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:04.190
like grinding burger I get such a pain

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:06.170
in the ass cuz the auger sometimes gets

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:09.020
like [ __ ] jammed up and if you [ __ ]

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.000
up hitting the pet because it's a pedal

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.320
like you just stand there like almost

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.700
like a sewing machine like trying to

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.410
like get it out of there if the auger

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:18.020
backfires it will shoot meat all over

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.220
the [ __ ] place and there have been

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.650
times I didn't know anything about it I

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:24.200
just get hit blasted with ground burger

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.280
and like I come out like who's next

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.080

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.680
there was what he was a kiddies do it

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.690

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:00.339
actually did it in The Sopranos I mean I

00:50:00.339 --> 00:50:02.739
was you know I never did it but what you

00:50:02.739 --> 00:50:04.059
do is that you know when they weigh it

00:50:04.059 --> 00:50:06.700
on yeah it's right there

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.999
when it's always off the first time yeah

00:50:09.999 --> 00:50:11.769
so when he goes do it put a pack of

00:50:11.769 --> 00:50:12.999
matches right in between the weight and

00:50:12.999 --> 00:50:14.319
the scale so when he goes down it

00:50:36.579 --> 00:50:38.229
acne if you do so I know I want to try

00:50:38.229 --> 00:50:39.640

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.079
self-checkout you just hold it on the

00:50:41.079 --> 00:50:42.249
thing and lift it a little bit and

00:50:42.249 --> 00:50:43.479

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:50.890
apples and hold it and that like you

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:52.450
know half pound touch and you're holding

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.830
two pounds of apples and rapido

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:55.600
sometimes it's also if you have PL you

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.580
look numbers like so every piece of

00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.590
fruit or vegetable has like a PLU number

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:02.160
then type in if you know the number of

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.720
something that's a lesser value you can

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.849
watch the video and like in a way you're

00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:18.260
impressively on the securityq and you're

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.690
like oh that guy stole an entire pallet

00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:22.130
and I go ahead when he still was a pal

00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:23.780
so the pallet had a bunch of baby

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.970
formula formula

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:28.400
like things like that that should have

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.710
been the red flag right then and fare of

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:32.780
like what he was targeting yeah however

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:36.380
it was it wasn't just all like that mean

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.810
the gold in that cave was the baby

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:40.609
formula but he was taking a lot of like

00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:43.640
crazy it was just like he just did this

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:46.119
and did this and again the whole time

00:57:46.119 --> 00:57:51.130
like fake counting like the whole

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:56.780
managerial power to the dark side that's

00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:58.700
the funny thing is when he started doing

00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.380
that everyone watching the video like oh

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.840

00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:07.880

time thievery do you know do you know

00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:15.980
what that is time thievery is if you are

00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:18.800
on camera not doing a job if you're part

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.720
of the Union they can't fire you but

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.280
what they can do is they see you on

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.380
camera not doing your job they can

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:26.300
reduce your hours and then they reduce

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:27.800
everyone's hours because like look we

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.450
gave that guy an eight-hour shift he got

00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:31.310
everything done in three to four hours

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:33.710
let's just cut everyone at the city

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:36.890

01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:53.190

called but it was like I did go and like

01:07:59.339 --> 01:08:00.869
paint the line I would shock the lines

01:08:00.869 --> 01:08:02.490
out every morning there was a guy who

01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:04.259
basically told us the ways of fake work

01:08:04.259 --> 01:08:06.059
and he was like and it's like kinda

01:08:06.059 --> 01:08:08.160
scopes do Walt he's old man he that you

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.869
guys can't sit around here just play

01:08:09.869 --> 01:08:11.789
Thibodeau drive the golf cart I would

01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:12.990
have to drive around like check the

01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:14.849
lines and like he instructed us how to

01:08:14.849 --> 01:08:17.130
like fake clean stuff who's like he said

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:18.270
I've been here for 20 years usually

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:19.650
trust me I know how to stick around here

01:08:19.650 --> 01:08:22.560
it's also a that's great it was like you

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.580
would go there in the morning do the

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.440
lines clean up the locker room enter the

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.759
job you get to go home for like three

01:08:26.759 --> 01:08:28.109
hours you can come back at night and I

01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:29.730
clean up again oh yeah yeah so he was

01:08:29.730 --> 01:08:30.989
there all the time he's like trust me

01:08:30.989 --> 01:08:32.310
guys he's like I don't need they don't

01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:32.730
need me

01:08:32.730 --> 01:08:34.319
like 90% of the stuff I do yeah he's

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.420
like I have invented stuff that needs to

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:39.509
be yeah that's great job also when you

01:08:39.509 --> 01:08:41.250
see when you go to a grocery I mean I

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:42.900
guess not now cuz like Whole Foods is

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:44.640
different because they're non-union and

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.529
like Trader Joe's is now non-union but

01:08:46.529 --> 01:08:49.049
when you go to like uh when you go to a

01:08:49.049 --> 01:08:50.520
grocery store and you see somebody who's

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.190
clearly in their 50s 60s maybe even 70s

01:08:53.190 --> 01:08:55.440
you think they're there for no reason

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.660
they found a way to literally do the

01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:59.759
least amount of work and get top rate

01:08:59.759 --> 01:09:01.710
for it and like in a way it's almost

01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:04.319
impressive because they're doing

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:05.460
something's like what do you do is like

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:09.150
well I I go down aisle 6 what do you do

01:09:09.150 --> 01:09:12.630
down there Dottie can I go down aisle 6

01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:15.290
[Laughter]

01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:18.000
that's why that's why hang their

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.299
workforce is geriatric now and you were

01:09:21.299 --> 01:09:23.310
conditioned to like what do you do oh

01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:25.500
I'm working in this grocery store so my

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.089
son or daughter can go to college and

01:09:27.089 --> 01:09:28.799
not worry about groceries a world war

01:09:28.799 --> 01:09:31.440
two money ran out it's just you don't

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.819
think about like people who work in

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:34.319
gross Whole Foods are different cuz now

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:35.970
you got those hipster Fox who work

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:36.900
they're like I'm trying to make a

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.060
difference it's like no you're still

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:42.150
doing the same [ __ ] you get someone

01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:43.380
working a grocery store now just like

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.210
nah dude like the food here saving

01:09:45.210 --> 01:09:47.220
people and yeah what your [ __ ] yeah

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:49.170
breakfast bar over there yeah man I'm

01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:50.880
telling you that saves lives that's

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.190
that's the that's kind of that's like

01:09:53.190 --> 01:09:55.320
part and parcel of our modern religion

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.880
it's like now you're not working a

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.170
grocery store though what you know in a

01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:00.360
way is like God do you like this isn't

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.170
just a grocery store

01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:04.620
we're like feeding people yeah yeah dude

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.660
it's like you're trying to justify a job

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:08.310
that's why we you know it's funnier to

01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:09.570
talk about the construction guys like

01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:10.950
yeah yeah I don't [ __ ] know I show up

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:12.390
that [ __ ] guy tells me what to do

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:15.150
dude there was a time [ __ ] about the

01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:17.670
world of Mike yes dude I love the shifts

01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:19.830
I'm also of like having younger like

01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:22.020
hipster attitude coming into like an

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.090
older grocery store there was one time

01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:25.500

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:27.000
what I'm about yeah what was its daily

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:33.160
yeah I got a at my school apparently

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.530
there's people there's well there's a

01:12:35.530 --> 01:12:37.270
cadre of students trying to get me

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:40.390
kicked out and there was a one one girl

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:43.240
apparently was telling people that I one

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:46.180
time spoke in support of slavery sick

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:47.860
and it was what I was talking about I

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.060
was like well is like you guys deal with

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:52.120
slavery in the abstract this is my whole

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.320
point I'm like you guys deal with the

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:55.120
idea of slavery in the abstract hundreds

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.100
of years separated from the thing when

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.619
when they were canceling slavery

01:12:59.619 --> 01:13:08.050
hilarious way to say but when they wait

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:19.329
for the plantation like swig like I was

01:13:19.329 --> 01:13:21.399
like I was like they were steeped a

01:13:21.399 --> 01:13:23.110
slavery was an institution that spanned

01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:24.639
back your like the dawn of civilization

01:13:24.639 --> 01:13:27.429
so like you were talking about it in the

01:13:27.429 --> 01:13:29.379
abstract we're like yeah I can recognize

01:13:29.379 --> 01:13:31.840
I'm like imagine if tomorrow someone was

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.699
like no no eating meat is actually

01:13:33.699 --> 01:13:35.499
murdering a conscious human being and

01:13:35.499 --> 01:13:38.219
you're a [ __ ] murderer you're like

01:13:38.219 --> 01:13:40.360
everybody was you know it's like it's

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.260
out there you're not dealing with

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:43.329
veganism in the abstract we're living in

01:13:43.329 --> 01:13:44.530
it when you're all steeped in it yeah

01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:46.329
apparently through saying that I'm like

01:13:46.329 --> 01:13:47.739
they're like well you speak any sleep

01:13:47.739 --> 01:13:52.510
how does show that why hate me bro I'm

01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:53.829
getting this back secondhand so I've

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:55.719
known my words would be in a store yeah

01:13:55.719 --> 01:13:57.999
everything but from the thing I'm

01:13:57.999 --> 01:13:59.619
hearing I wouldn't put it past some dude

01:13:59.619 --> 01:14:01.869
but yeah dude it's like that it's crazy

01:14:01.869 --> 01:14:12.879
slavery getting cancelled no that must

01:14:12.879 --> 01:14:14.260
have been a tough thing they dawn on

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.090
people you're like I don't know I think

01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:17.409

01:32:16.650 --> 01:32:18.269
cold turkey because I know I can't I

01:32:18.269 --> 01:32:19.949
just know I won't even when I took a

01:32:19.949 --> 01:32:21.630
month off of not drinking part of me was

01:32:21.630 --> 01:32:22.829
like you're [ __ ] you're letting it

01:32:22.829 --> 01:32:24.449
win in my head it's like you're letting

01:32:24.449 --> 01:32:26.729
booze win yeah if you give up something

01:32:26.729 --> 01:32:28.530
that like makes you feel a certain way

01:32:28.530 --> 01:32:30.719
either good or whatever and you're like

01:32:30.719 --> 01:32:32.400
you know what that's been just two

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:33.840
months like you let that [ __ ] thing

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.820
win I don't want to [ __ ] do that so

01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:37.679
I'd limit myself to like one beer a day

01:32:37.679 --> 01:32:40.530
and when I was doing like when I I took

01:32:40.530 --> 01:32:43.860
five in a day like five every day and

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:45.809
I'll tell you what five every day or one

01:32:45.809 --> 01:32:48.809
per day one a day four five yeah yeah

01:32:48.809 --> 01:32:51.809
when I [ __ ] up I should have explained

01:32:51.809 --> 01:32:54.659
it one day two days off one day but like

01:32:54.659 --> 01:32:56.339
the first three days I was like I

01:32:56.339 --> 01:32:58.949
I'm on a streak of enlightenment it's

01:32:58.949 --> 01:32:59.879
great though

01:32:59.879 --> 01:33:01.679
anything dude and there's just serotonin

01:33:01.679 --> 01:33:03.030
me and brain it's all yeah that was the

01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:04.679
craziest thing too though what I was

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:06.359
like I told you about like the sense of

01:33:06.359 --> 01:33:09.179
smell it was absurd the first day I did

01:33:09.179 --> 01:33:11.399
it why am i smelling everything like I

01:33:11.399 --> 01:33:13.979
can settle everything and I thought it

01:33:13.979 --> 01:33:15.300
was me just being like you're kind of

01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:17.489
tripping you're making no sense but then

01:33:17.489 --> 01:33:18.539
the next day I did I was eating

01:33:18.539 --> 01:33:20.969
breakfast I was like everything was I

01:33:20.969 --> 01:33:22.260
was almost overwhelming like I had to

01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:24.359
separate my breakfast and my coffee and

01:33:24.359 --> 01:33:26.159
what all didn't like cuz if I it's all

01:33:26.159 --> 01:33:28.289
together I'm like overdose like what the

01:33:28.289 --> 01:33:30.030
[ __ ] is going on increases your visual

01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:32.429
acuity small doses increases your visual

01:33:32.429 --> 01:33:34.050
acuity cuz your pupils get larger taking

01:33:34.050 --> 01:33:35.579
in more light yeah so it could increase

01:33:35.579 --> 01:33:37.499
your sense of smell yes no but then it

01:33:37.499 --> 01:33:39.359
was also a level I like I told you I was

01:33:39.359 --> 01:33:41.399
walking to Old City like I was walking

01:33:41.399 --> 01:33:43.109
to pick up a paycheck I was walking

01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:44.010
through Old City because it was just a

01:33:44.010 --> 01:33:46.859
nice Kampala dolphin through it there

01:33:46.859 --> 01:33:48.119
was one point in time where I was like

01:33:48.119 --> 01:33:51.749
kind of like a paranoid yeah somebody's

01:33:51.749 --> 01:33:52.889
[ __ ] watching me right now but I'm

01:33:52.889 --> 01:33:54.539
like you know what I'm not even afraid

01:33:54.539 --> 01:33:56.939
because if they come and try and step to

01:33:56.939 --> 01:33:58.800
me I will cut their [ __ ] eyes out and

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:02.669
that'll be their problem I'm not worried

01:34:02.669 --> 01:34:05.489
come at me world but it was like part of

01:34:05.489 --> 01:34:06.719
me is like I feel good that I could

01:34:06.719 --> 01:34:08.629
merge are you normally paranoid no

01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:11.909
that's also normally paranoid the thing

01:34:11.909 --> 01:34:13.949
is like I'm never really paranoid it's

01:34:13.949 --> 01:34:15.809
like I the thing is I'll tell you

01:34:15.809 --> 01:34:17.550
working in the bar and like service

01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:19.829
industry like you feel eyes on you like

01:34:19.829 --> 01:34:21.239
when you yell yeah

01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:23.909
squaring you up but like that day as I

01:34:23.909 --> 01:34:25.289
was walking it felt like everyone was

01:34:25.289 --> 01:34:27.139
just like who is that guy

01:34:27.139 --> 01:34:29.819
what's your problem yeah exactly like if

01:34:29.819 --> 01:34:31.499
you put that attitude in yeah which is

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:32.849
great cuz it's like yeah I don't give a

01:34:32.849 --> 01:34:34.260
[ __ ] yeah I'm not doing anything wrong

01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:36.179
off dude like but it was part of me as a

01:34:36.179 --> 01:34:37.739
wire it's everyone looking at me like

01:34:37.739 --> 01:34:39.959
I'm part of me it's like maybe I look

01:34:39.959 --> 01:34:41.909
like I'm tripping maybe I look like I'm

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:43.769
having a hallucinogenic trip

01:34:43.769 --> 01:34:45.510
ya know like party music man I guess I

01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:47.129
look like I'm [ __ ] high right now but

01:34:47.129 --> 01:34:48.989
you know what [ __ ] those people cuz I'll

01:34:48.989 --> 01:34:50.969
murder all of them you know I'm gonna do

01:34:50.969 --> 01:34:53.500
I'm gonna get me some [ __ ] jambalaya

01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.399
[Laughter]

01:34:55.399 --> 01:34:57.929
it is a small dose but I'll also I'll

01:34:57.929 --> 01:34:59.909
get like you know I have my mental

01:34:59.909 --> 01:35:01.499
chatter basically all day and then I'll

01:35:01.499 --> 01:35:03.300
have another little bigger slower mental

01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:04.800
chatter but I will go into a point where

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.679
like I'll start really analyzing [ __ ] to

01:35:07.679 --> 01:35:09.419
the point where it'll like make me like

01:35:09.419 --> 01:35:11.399
what the [ __ ] shouldn't be this is this

01:35:11.399 --> 01:35:13.050
is too weird but lately I just been

01:35:13.050 --> 01:35:14.519
going with it I missed I got real under

01:35:14.519 --> 01:35:15.899
like the Greek conception of a woman's

01:35:15.899 --> 01:35:17.519
and [ __ ] and I'm like I have such a sick

01:35:17.519 --> 01:35:19.679
[ __ ] game on yeah just brings up like

01:35:19.679 --> 01:35:20.729
I'll just be like I was in Whole Foods

01:35:20.729 --> 01:35:22.439
the one the first time I did it and I

01:35:22.439 --> 01:35:24.389
like I was looking at everyone I'm like

01:35:24.389 --> 01:35:26.309
damn we're all gonna [ __ ] die and I

01:35:26.309 --> 01:35:28.880
was like thinking about death and I'm

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.079
checking out of the grocery store some

01:35:31.079 --> 01:35:32.579
big little things like that yeah I'm

01:35:32.579 --> 01:35:34.619
naturally kind of neurotic so like yeah

01:35:34.619 --> 01:35:36.209
you can kind of speed that up for me but

01:35:36.209 --> 01:35:38.010
I've got the whole point of this for me

01:35:38.010 --> 01:35:41.729
is to even the most neurotic if people

01:35:41.729 --> 01:35:44.579
can even like the whole problem of doing

01:35:44.579 --> 01:35:45.780
psychedelics is if you're kind of

01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:47.669
neurotic you can stick a turn on you

01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:49.919
yeah and then being able to like turn

01:35:49.919 --> 01:35:51.869
that off like how I go to like I was in

01:35:51.869 --> 01:35:53.489
I was in [ __ ] school and like do to

01:35:53.489 --> 01:35:54.869
everyone there hates me there's one a

01:35:54.869 --> 01:35:56.309
little bit of mushrooms in a room for

01:35:56.309 --> 01:35:57.719
most people [ __ ] can't stand me

01:35:57.719 --> 01:35:58.919
that's the worst set it you can have

01:35:58.919 --> 01:36:00.749
absolutely I was still able to kind of

01:36:00.749 --> 01:36:03.090
like turn around turn it down and like

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:04.619
yes still you know that's the whole

01:36:04.619 --> 01:36:05.939
point of it is the kind of learning I

01:36:05.939 --> 01:36:07.919
don't think anyone should go like a bad

01:36:07.919 --> 01:36:09.239
setting on purpose I was like that was

01:36:09.239 --> 01:36:11.189
not it was a bad idea that was good that

01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:12.899
was my biggest concern though like that

01:36:12.899 --> 01:36:14.550
was more of like when you told me like

01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:16.289
other small doses it'll be alright part

01:36:16.289 --> 01:36:18.300
of me was like I understand

01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:20.519
maybe these are small doses but I also

01:36:20.519 --> 01:36:23.429
know me like I know how angry and

01:36:23.429 --> 01:36:25.260
negative I am and even if you're like

01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:27.329
sure it's just a small amount of

01:36:27.329 --> 01:36:28.860
gasoline but if you throw that on the

01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:30.989
fire exactly still make and turn it on

01:36:30.989 --> 01:36:32.669
yeah so I'm just like [ __ ] I don't know

01:36:32.669 --> 01:36:34.439
how this is gonna go but it was more

01:36:34.439 --> 01:36:35.909
like because I remember being like the

01:36:35.909 --> 01:36:37.919
last time decided to sell via trip the

01:36:37.919 --> 01:36:40.019
last time I took mushrooms I remember

01:36:40.019 --> 01:36:41.519
like sitting in a room and I wasn't like

01:36:41.519 --> 01:36:42.840
full-blown tripping but I was like

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.969
almost convincing myself that I was

01:36:44.969 --> 01:36:47.489
adopted that's all like I was like you

01:36:47.489 --> 01:36:49.739
know when like my mom doesn't really do

01:36:49.739 --> 01:36:52.079
anything I [ __ ] do or like anything

01:36:52.079 --> 01:36:54.179
I've ever done like my dad is like such

01:36:54.179 --> 01:36:58.559
a like he's so left but like right at

01:36:58.559 --> 01:37:00.030
the same time and doesn't even make any

01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:01.889
sense like Kyle and I never get the I am

01:37:01.889 --> 01:37:08.760
NOT of my mother like I am not anything

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.769
like those people like and I have all

01:37:10.769 --> 01:37:13.139
these things that they don't do my way

01:37:13.139 --> 01:37:15.389
they never thought I'm into art and

01:37:15.389 --> 01:37:16.919
drawing and painting none of them have

01:37:16.919 --> 01:37:19.349
any artistic skill whatsoever how is

01:37:19.349 --> 01:37:21.300
that [ __ ] happen I dunno I was like

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:22.800
literally breaking it down yeah

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:25.410
I'm like do I even look like them do I

01:37:25.410 --> 01:37:27.240
even look well it's weird that's dude

01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:28.470
that's the whole point of that stuff if

01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:30.210
it brings up unconscious material it was

01:37:30.210 --> 01:37:30.630
crazy

01:37:30.630 --> 01:37:32.160
so it brings it up and it's like can you

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.510
handle that and a lot of times you bring

01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:35.100
it up your process and you're like okay

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:36.960
I feel better after that or it hits you

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.070
and he gets stuck and you're just like

01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:41.340
well yeah I wasn't like mad at that

01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:43.020
thought though yeah I wasn't like god

01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:44.610
damn and I didn't lie to you my whole

01:37:44.610 --> 01:37:46.410
sure if I was more like that makes more

01:37:46.410 --> 01:37:47.630
sense

01:37:47.630 --> 01:37:50.120
dude I was like honestly to deal with

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:52.740
the gun for a second I was like even

01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:54.930
dude with the cast we did yesterday yeah

01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:56.280
if someone's like you know Tom's not

01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:59.850
your dad I'm like [ __ ] cool yeah

01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:01.290
how's it been in terms of not drinking

01:38:01.290 --> 01:38:03.300
these and it's easier oh it's you know

01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:05.940
what it's again it's like it's more like

01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:08.340
you feel like you're supposed to stick

01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:10.710
to the regimen you make up in your mind

01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:12.630
yeah it's more like yeah I'm doing this

01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:14.760
but like if I don't know I feel better

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.320
about sticking to my guns is where like

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.450
if I wasn't doing it I'd feel like I'm

01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:21.090
like lying to my so yeah the whole point

01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:23.820
I've like heard stuff about especially

01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:25.740
like what's it called how the abstinence

01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:27.750
model is kind of it's just a bad idea to

01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:30.180
have someone giving up a thing they do

01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:32.370
and now all they do is think about how

01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:33.630
every day they're giving up a thing you

01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:35.070
do and you're really supposed to replace

01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:37.260
that life so it's so colorful that you

01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:38.730
don't need that's the whole point I

01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:40.530
think that's why I think AAA is kind of

01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:43.260
like a fraud it is like it's just you're

01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:45.180
constantly if you're constantly in

01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:48.150
recovery you will never recover that's

01:38:48.150 --> 01:38:50.190
how it go that's how they keep you yeah

01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:51.900
that's crazy they never want you to

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:53.310
admit that you're not here and you're

01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:55.290
good and you can [ __ ] walk away from

01:38:55.290 --> 01:38:56.250
it because they're gonna be like no you

01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:58.470
can't model that are pushing back

01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:59.940
against that this whole idea of being

01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:02.070
like understand and they're like whoa

01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:04.770
you know maybe you can actually face all

01:39:04.770 --> 01:39:06.480
your issues and not do yeah I mean it

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.650
does work for people like a holding

01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:08.640
environment you just want to stop

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.140
drinking and talk to other people but

01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:11.460
you have to like delve into your issues

01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:13.500
why do you do it but you also just might

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.180
like to [ __ ] drink a lot yeah there's

01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:16.770
that was another thing too is like

01:39:16.770 --> 01:39:18.900
people man you've got some real demons

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:20.490
down there like that's actually I just

01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:22.980
enjoyed you know knocking a few the [ __ ]

01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:25.770
back and lose control exactly this time

01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:28.770
it's just but I also know that like me

01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:30.870
being out of control of that which

01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:32.760
happens faster than not and that's

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.860
because of the amount I drink with how

01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:36.210
fast I drink if you've ever

01:39:36.210 --> 01:39:38.100
see me fly through beers like wow that

01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:40.290
guy's [ __ ] just yeah what's he running

01:39:40.290 --> 01:39:41.820
away from it's nothing I'm just that's

01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:45.540
it's rare yeah I like because I used to

01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:47.400
used to get away from me when I would

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.290
drink but then I always started like

01:39:49.290 --> 01:39:51.270
eating ingesting weed or smoking weed

01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:52.770
while I drank and it slows you down like

01:39:52.770 --> 01:39:55.080
yeah you can do I see I can't do that

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.510
yeah I need to do Nev I just drink

01:39:57.510 --> 01:40:00.390
shitty fish but if I'm smoking weed I'm

01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:02.160
like alert and then I'll be like this is

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:03.900
a natural like dude slow down yeah

01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:07.020
that's yeah that's what the microphone

01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:08.640
has been doing for me whereas like

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.640
before you even think about standing up

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:14.219
to put your body in motion to go outside

01:40:14.219 --> 01:40:16.290
and smoke why are you even gonna do that

01:40:16.290 --> 01:40:17.700
and then I'm right and then it's like an

01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:20.219
hour later yeah I'm white so I'll

01:40:20.219 --> 01:40:23.550
definitely smoke but those gaps of not

01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:25.590
smoking start adding up you know to me

01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:27.660
because there's a one book about it I

01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:30.540
think Jimmy has it but with the doing

01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:31.860
just going to the physical steps of

01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:33.540
smoking that's how a lot of people quit

01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:34.980
they'll just go outside of their job for

01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:36.690
like five minutes walk around the

01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:38.430
[ __ ] building and walk back in with a

01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:40.230
mentally to like that's when I would

01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:42.000
have went out and smoked so recently I

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.700
did that act but I'd never stuck with me

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:45.630
I go out there I'm like well this

01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:50.940
[ __ ] sucks walked out so it's like

01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:53.430
now it's great yeah the whole idea is to

01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:55.170
like so you you put yourself in a

01:40:55.170 --> 01:40:56.670
slightly altered state that way you can

01:40:56.670 --> 01:40:58.290
still function and do stuff and then

01:40:58.290 --> 01:41:00.120
your so your brains kind of you know

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.590
your brains have like the levels of

01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:03.690
serotonin are up and then you're able to

01:41:03.690 --> 01:41:05.670
go without these things are usually kind

01:41:05.670 --> 01:41:07.320
of scrambling for little dopamine fixes

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:08.489
you're not the day like you're all day

01:41:08.489 --> 01:41:09.510
long it's a girl meeting him about a

01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:10.710
drink'll maybe filming you get kind of

01:41:10.710 --> 01:41:13.050
like addicted to these like anything TV

01:41:13.050 --> 01:41:14.940
my caffeine yeah okay so you're like you

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:16.530
have your sources of dopamine and then

01:41:16.530 --> 01:41:18.120
you flood your brain with serotonin and

01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.710
you're like oh I can I can do without

01:41:19.710 --> 01:41:21.630
these things or yes if I don't need them

01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:23.880
it's and then you start slowly modeling

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.469
a for yourself the days that you're

01:41:25.469 --> 01:41:27.930
altered you model yourself motive

01:41:27.930 --> 01:41:30.120
behavior that you can try to emulate on

01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:31.380
the days when it's not in your system

01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:33.030
and then you slowly kind of can rewire

01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:34.500
your brain like that where you build

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.150
different habits and then you start

01:41:36.150 --> 01:41:37.590
getting your dopamine payoffs from

01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:38.910
things that are more productive and less

01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:39.660
destructive

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:41.910
and that's that's really I mean again

01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:43.890
when you were talking about like walking

01:41:43.890 --> 01:41:45.510
around like just going outside and doing

01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:48.120
the wrong thing it's also like sometimes

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.679
I'll go to like I'll just go to a bar

01:41:49.679 --> 01:41:51.030
and I'm like half of me is like what am

01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:53.010
i doing in here kouno bar is fun that's

01:41:53.010 --> 01:41:54.630
a problem that uh that's the thing but

01:41:54.630 --> 01:41:56.880
then I'll go there and luckily for me

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.980
the people the where I'm going people

01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:00.480
know who I am so I'm like what's this

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:02.340

01:42:17.610 --> 01:42:18.570

farts and comes at the same time weird

01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:42.119
I'm like you're a Chinese dude that was

01:44:42.119 --> 01:44:43.650
the thing like I remember the one girl

01:44:43.650 --> 01:44:45.840
I'm seeing every now and again she asked

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:48.389
me to come see her at work once yeah and

01:44:48.389 --> 01:44:49.980
I was like that's a bender oh [ __ ] I

01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:51.330
don't wanna you don't want to be that no

01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:53.429
no I don't and she was like why I'm like

01:44:53.429 --> 01:44:55.530
one of two things are gonna happen one

01:44:55.530 --> 01:44:58.409
I'm gonna watch you all over some

01:44:58.409 --> 01:45:01.020
strange weird dude I mean like oh great

01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:03.810
that's cool there's the girl inside of

01:45:03.810 --> 01:45:06.860
every now and again on that guy oh

01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:09.210
there's no way I could do it dude the

01:45:09.210 --> 01:45:11.639
other thing is too like she would we

01:45:11.639 --> 01:45:13.110
would get together after she was done

01:45:13.110 --> 01:45:15.030
work right because we both work late

01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:17.369
hours and there be times were like I get

01:45:17.369 --> 01:45:18.389
it it's like she picking me up after

01:45:18.389 --> 01:45:21.409
work and I get in the car and it's like

01:45:21.409 --> 01:45:23.369
like in my head like what's that smell

01:45:23.369 --> 01:45:26.699
Mike oh that's just other dudes like

01:45:26.699 --> 01:45:28.679
when a dog can smell you've been around

01:45:28.679 --> 01:45:29.520
other dogs

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:39.570
I tried hang on the stripper once I was

01:45:39.570 --> 01:45:42.989
right yeah if it's a casual thing it's

01:45:42.989 --> 01:45:44.429
easier like we were a kind of like a

01:45:44.429 --> 01:45:46.409
casual thing but like I still have to

01:45:46.409 --> 01:45:48.330
graham dude dude looking back and like

01:45:48.330 --> 01:45:49.590
the fact that like we were seeing each

01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:50.940
other fairly frequently oh my god I

01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:52.980
don't know if I'm cool with you like not

01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:54.270
that I'm not cool with it I'm just like

01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:59.190
I don't know if I can be yeah but like

01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:01.110
she got out she was only she honestly

01:46:01.110 --> 01:46:02.760
was literally doing like the hustle

01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:04.500
thing she was only there for a good

01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:05.880
month and I don't care that girl's good

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:10.679
like I couldn't date a girl but like

01:46:10.679 --> 01:46:12.239
before I mean there was a natural

01:46:12.239 --> 01:46:13.980
progression what is it like you start

capitalizing off of you know sex work is

01:49:28.690 --> 01:49:30.550
real work and it sure it is yeah but

01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:33.160
we're also saying is sometimes when

01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:34.690

01:49:34.690 --> 01:49:37.690
sex work as the real work and every now

01:49:37.690 --> 01:49:39.280

is different but it's like I mean this

01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:35.020
is something this is something that when

01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:37.030
someone says that to you it's kind of

01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:38.260
like [ __ ]

01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:40.120
I even asked like ex-girlfriend of mine

01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:42.010
because she was really into being choked

01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:42.610
during

01:50:42.610 --> 01:50:45.760
it's like really into it yeah now at one

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:48.130
point in time just like in passing we're

01:50:48.130 --> 01:50:49.360
sitting on the couch or watching a movie

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.680
where's like someone's like [ __ ]

01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:52.030
around in the movie they're having sex

01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:53.770
or whatever and he puts his hand on her

01:50:53.770 --> 01:50:55.330
throat I'm like I have a question like

01:50:55.330 --> 01:50:58.210
how did you know that how did you get

01:50:58.210 --> 01:51:00.010
into that like cuz that doesn't just

01:51:00.010 --> 01:51:01.510
like I'm trying to think of the first

01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:03.010
time I had sex with somebody was like

01:51:03.010 --> 01:51:05.020
choking them no it was me like I'm

01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:09.240

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:19.390
just came yeah thank you as you get

01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:21.280
older like kinks arise and whatever but

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:23.080
like I remember ask him like how did you

01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:24.880
know you were that was your thing and

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:27.730
she's like I don't really know right and

01:51:27.730 --> 01:51:30.190
that's like I'm kind of blown away mind

01:51:30.190 --> 01:51:32.740
that and then I start thinking like how

01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:34.720
did this girl know that getting her

01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:37.690
butthole speculum dopin and having a man

01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:41.260
with his limp flaccid penis pee in it

01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:43.390
was your thing that's just the invisible

01:51:43.390 --> 01:51:45.370
hand of the market that she was like

01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:47.380

01:51:50.290 --> 01:51:52.060
terrified she accepted it was like yeah

it so she's like that's my thing it's

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.090
