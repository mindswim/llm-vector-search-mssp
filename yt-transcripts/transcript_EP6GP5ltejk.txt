that must've been terrifying before

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.020
people really understood radiation

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.010
they're just well that's what the best

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.750
part is yeah they're trying to cover it

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.940
all up - it's the funniest part and it's

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.560
starting to drift away I won't tell you

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.020

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.870
it's tough to watch dude it's tough and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.880
I'm not even talking I mean seeing the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.500
after-effects of like the people that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.670
were there but like yeah I'm fine it's

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.320
just a fire and it's like what a week

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.360
later they bring in the Moscow they're

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.840
in the hospital oh it's [ __ ] oh yeah

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.360
so the plan explodes the core explodes

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.900
yeah intranets down yeah and then they

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.240
just sent firefighters in so these dudes

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.070
one of the dudes literally picks up a

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.110
piece of graphite from the core like

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.150
he's just holding it and then it cuts to

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.830
like like you know five seconds later

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.660
he's like [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] my hands

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.030
falling off like it's not stood so every

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.580
firefighter that went they rushed them

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.170
all to Moscow and they're like you guys

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.610

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.100
you because you are [ __ ] yeah and then

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.660
it shows the one dude in there last time

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.250
they spread it to other people from

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.570

she was getting a little too friendly

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.900
baby yeah it goes back to something they

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.510
brought up it was a small detail but

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.100
this is the episode where they have to

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.520
like execute on that and you'll see

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.870
exactly what I'm talking about there's

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.520
my how much deal oh there's the Myers

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.400
were the best of the miners no Myers but

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.080
yet they went get and the best is the

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.640
guy who's leading him he's just like I

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.290

these worked you'd be [ __ ] wearing

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.900
them and then the next scene he just

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.100
brings his dudes and they're all just

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.350
naked bringing out [ __ ] like they

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.240
basically know they're gonna die yeah he

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.220
knows but he's like no Soviet no

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.330
spider-man effects

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.080
the dongs like a little radioactive bite

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.220
no but in the new one they have a

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.470
contraption for that for your dolphin

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.229
egg basket Don protection boys Multan

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.969
mine and they have no not miners

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.939
just regular like the soldiers and army

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.789
about running around and a vest yeah

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.319
yeah it looks like this is like an old

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.990
piece of tinfoil around like cardboard

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.400
and they're like yeah put this on your

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.750

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:59.189
cool these guys there's also you know

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:00.930
the heroism involved like these dudes

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.819
that are like like that one dude the

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.460
messes that starts they all have meters

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.340
- how much radiation is being really

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.569
like 3.7 whatever the yeah and they're

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.270
like no that's 3.7 is like enough for

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.069
like a chest x-ray you said they're like

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.560
don't worry about it unless you need a

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.029
chest x-ray because then your Nobles

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.710
fine then the guy there's a scientist

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.180
that it's like no it's just as high as

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.020
the meter reads it's crazy numbers must

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.430
have been crazy with it how long's it

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.460
last they're doing the math and like

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.599
25,000 the where is it still [ __ ] up

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.819
now yeah it's like no things around

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.620
there right everyone kind of moved away

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.430
City no you can go there and you can

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.770
take tours and everyone has to have that

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.080
meter though the thing that like makes

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.360
the clicking [ __ ] would go there they

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.710
have tours there I was watching

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.659
something and everyone's cancer go it's

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.580
exactly what you thought it's not like a

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.710
thriving town it's just [ __ ] empty

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.199
buildings and just horrible [ __ ]

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.539
situation but people are like gonna do

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.009
like they says hey I'm like yeah I can

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.479
just Google image it and get the same

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.089
yeah actually I'm good with that I can

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:16.229
just go to like the Eastern State

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.020
Penitentiary the clip please sick by the

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.029
way you so say yeah you ever been there

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.159
yeah [ __ ] awesome yeah that they do

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:25.169
the [ __ ] horn announcing right they

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:31.680
do it Shammi really yeah you put on

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.060
headphones and Stevie it's a hi I'm

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.770
Steve Buscemi like what the [ __ ]

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.380
it's [ __ ] sick guys yes so when

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.400
they're getting their readings they're

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.690
like it's 3:00 that's just as high as

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.699
the meter goes it's probably a crazy not

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.350
like we got to send someone in to get a

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.800
reading and the this captain military

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.479
captain he's like they're like you gotta

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.100
pick someone he's like will they die

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.770
they're like pretty much definitely he's

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.449
like well then I'll do it so he gets

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:02.430
into like a lead truck and flies in

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:08.210
checks it he's like it's 15,000 guys

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:10.770
it's like within two weeks all of them

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.600
like the first responders and like that

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.490
guy it was like within probably two

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.380
weeks a week and it's funny because they

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.900
have the machines and it's good clicking

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.160
it sounds like the [ __ ] predator

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.949
around every corner dude at the end of

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:28.110
the first or second episode they send

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.539
three dudes in dude the Three Stooges

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:33.570
come in they so they come in immediately

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.729
the flashlights go out because of the

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:38.030
radiation so they're in a pitch-black

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.720
half water just destroys everything a

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.789
helicopter crashes trying to fly over it

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:47.070
it's like a magical know knows what the

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.229
[ __ ] it is the whole time they're just

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:51.870
like I still Russian miner at this point

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.970
still like he seemed like the smartest

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.010
one the leader of the mine he was like

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.570
all right I get it I know what you guys

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.180
[ __ ] up you need us to basically go in

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.580
there and dig a dive right put something

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.810
in because they're about to [ __ ] the

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.520
whole world because the radiation seeped

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.900
into the ground and it was about to go

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.639
out to the what the Black Sea yeah or

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:14.699
something and then it was just like what

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:16.110
happens if it gets in there like well if

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.320
you can't live in Europe for all of your

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.570
yeah yeah like we're gonna poison the

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.760
drinking water of half the earth and

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.010
they really contain that [ __ ] yeah yeah

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.530
maybe it's like the first episode then

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.150
they started explaining what the [ __ ]

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.430
the problems are in the first episode

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:34.260
yeah some of that definitely got out the

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.089
scientists the best I mean the

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:37.380
scientists going through this like

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.959
booklet that's favorite part is crazy

00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:43.140
communists like the any state like the

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.730
state control over this trying to be

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.589
like nothing's wrong even in their

00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:49.200
highest levels like the highest or sure

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:49.980
possible

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.510
Gorbachev sitting there so they're all

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.140
like

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.510
no everything's great man did you show

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.340
all on that yeah yeah and that's the

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.750
thing everybody in there is like I

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.180
didn't [ __ ] do it you did it dude I

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.740
broke an air-conditioner an air

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.330
conditioning unit one time at work that

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.810
came all right cover to [ __ ] uh I

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.340
shouldn't be on the air right now I

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.530
covered it with a piece of plywood being

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.270
like I'll put a plywood up to protect

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.070
this a/c unit it's just like it needs a

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.720
sock you know all that air yeah [ __ ]

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.040
overheated and broke

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.300
thank you I didn't catch on fire like

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:25.110
flammables flaw like a big-ass one dude

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:31.760
I was like I was the same thing even

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.850
taking that rap I was like oh you're

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.920
Chernobyl dude I [ __ ] that's donning

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.240
the only one there was another one where

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.980
life there was a we were doing another

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.310
building where there was a server that

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.540
apparently it was rented so it was like

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.280
there's just a server room in this one

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.870
building and they said it was rented by

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.490
government agencies just and you had to

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.590
keep it quick a certain temperature mmm

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.300
I'm drumming animal they don't drop

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.770
himself I [ __ ] cut the power this

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.800
thing it was hot it was just like

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.180
there's a bunch of other people working

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.940
around me obviously especially in

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.110
construction if you break something to

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.720
get the [ __ ] out of there because that

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.850
was like who knows how much a server

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.320
costs what information would have been

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.660
lost and again I got Hillary's emails

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.510
they were like do not whatever you do

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.250
cutting so careful not to cut power to

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.660
this thing and finally I draw I like

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.890
what's caught in this thing down dropped

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.870
it like conk I was like I opened the

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.980
door it was a fans and servers were

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.300
still running with a fans I went out I

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.030
was like yeah sure Nobel is oh I feel

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.770
like the whole theme of that show is to

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.870
basically what everybody knows what

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.730
happened but it's like who did it

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.040
like who took the blame because right

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.900
now especially in the new one they go

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.430
through what actually happened why it

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.940
blew up okay which is pretty much not

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.150
that exciting I'm like God your system

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.410
sucked all right yeah it wasn't like the

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.610
cooling system [ __ ] it up

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.480
you think I just they miss like I'm the

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.730
minor step and that's what exploded the

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:03.810
core

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.970
a minor step house it was literally like

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.490
an off switch I swear to god they get

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.740
the system's ran on like three different

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.750
levels of like you know [ __ ] hits the

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.000
fan hit this if that doesn't work hit

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.860
this and then really balls fails hit

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:22.260
this they miss the second yeah well this

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.790
will take care of it no but it explodes

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.980
all 50 million people yeah the

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:33.300
birthplace of mr. Popov Popov on tap

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.270
dude this was what the fourth episode

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:40.440
the desert the first three there must be

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.170
at least six scenes that are relatable

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.060
to mission accomplished of Bush coming

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.620
in like we did it no we did six times

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.100
like we did this is what we need we need

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.279
to pour sand on problem solved well then

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:57.630
what happens it's like well the sand is

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.900
gonna melt and destroy the area but yeah

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.160
when that guy comes back with that

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.230
reading he like drives in he's like it's

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.150
15,000 the two dudes that said it was

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.500
three they're just like get on that

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.839
[ __ ] helicopter yeah just immediately

00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:12.450
get taken away but yeah you lie they all

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.270
lie like nothing's wrong Oh nothing's

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.040
wrong somebody's like something's wrong

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.510
all right kill the guy who said nothing

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.250
was wrong oh no it's your turn and then

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.300
that guy's like nothing's wrong like

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.620
poisoning the world's water supply and

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.510
having that fall on you the worst is the

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.860
people that involve what like the

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.290
scientists are like yo we [ __ ] it

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.560
[ __ ] get everyone out seriously and

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.670
the government's like that will never

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.980
happen in Russia like it is happy yeah

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.690
it's right and the government keeps

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.420
being like we're not [ __ ] the Muslims

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.860
wrong you're reading thing in the one

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.000
they do another one which is the

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.130
official statement and I think it's the

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.870
official statement to the US because

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.730
Ronnie Reagan's like what are you doing

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.209
turns out where you might have [ __ ] it

00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:59.780
but we don't know

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.080
Ragan back what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ]

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.400

we stole the elephant's foot yeah okay

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.150

this this big hunk of [ __ ] in a room in

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.120
the base of Chernobyl that's like if you

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.400
go into the room with that thing you die

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.380
if you even see it it's like Medusa like

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.730
if you're close enough to look at how

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.350

wait tsunami but it's shouldn't it be

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.079
like weather proof if you're building

00:15:45.079 --> 00:15:46.970
[ __ ] massive tsunami they didn't have

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:55.850
like walls around it prepared for this

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.800
to close the ocean dude you guys have

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.660
way too many priests to urk creatures

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.639
[ __ ] pleaser creatures lurking in the

00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:09.319
water come right out on that team that

Age prehistoric monsters in these

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.449
[ __ ] waters dude you can't have a

00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:16.850
power plant yeah that's like leaking out

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.480
into the ocean she means getting no

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.100
isn't that like the plan now for America

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.500
like generation 5 I think it's called

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.319
like Gen 5 power plants don't look it up

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:31.459
dude no facts okay I think I think one

00:16:31.459 --> 00:16:34.880
no fat no facts facts oh you can live

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.470
with facts dude no barely that's like

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.449
the that's the plan we're coming up with

00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:39.680
instead of let you know cuz we're going

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.790
like solar and all that stuff and

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.639
there's people there's like this new

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.779
nuclear energy people it's graphic it's

00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:46.279
called a generation 5 suppose tell me

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:48.079
about it yeah it's like this crazy

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:50.060
stuffs where like if you may this [ __ ]

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.440
is made successfully it's like we're all

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.149
rockin free energy for like oh you know

00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:56.120
my friend really nice and then we'll

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.529
build it and then the Russians will get

00:16:57.529 --> 00:16:58.550
a hold of it and they'll try to build

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.310
some shitty they don't know is a big

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.680
surgeon solo right now looking at the

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.809
Florida DC Jersey and about to be

00:17:07.809 --> 00:17:09.620
Virginia I think is an extra where the

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.030
government's given the kickbacks to the

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.069
people if you go solar it's huge yeah

00:26:46.309 --> 00:26:49.179
about torture uh I don't like it but

00:26:49.179 --> 00:26:54.070
yeah I don't want to happen to me yeah

00:26:54.219 --> 00:26:57.319
the movie Vice when they're like giving

00:26:57.319 --> 00:27:00.049
Cheney a bunch of lists and he's like

00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:02.659
round them all up I'm just like [ __ ]

00:27:02.659 --> 00:27:06.529
yeah yeah [ __ ] trial for a yeah what's a

00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:09.529

yeah I don't know I might I might people

00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:17.389
yelling appalled by it and it's like but

00:27:17.389 --> 00:27:19.459
I think that I think the main problem

00:27:19.459 --> 00:27:21.559
with it well number one it's you know

00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:24.919
it's crazy but number two is uh you get

00:27:24.919 --> 00:27:27.649
inaccurate results people you when you

00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:29.559
torture people they're just saying any

00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:31.459
literally you're being torture you're

00:27:31.459 --> 00:27:33.409
trying to say anything stop so it

00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:34.839
doesn't give you the best information

00:27:34.839 --> 00:27:37.190
yeah I don't know I feel like you'll get

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.049
people to sing right away if you use it

00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:41.299
as a deterrent like if you start killing

00:27:41.299 --> 00:27:43.069
people like hey this is what happens if

00:27:43.069 --> 00:27:44.599
you do this yeah we're gonna blow up

00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:46.429
your whole [ __ ] family which is I

00:27:46.429 --> 00:27:48.409
think what Trump said Trump was like

00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:49.849
with Isis yeah maybe we should start

00:27:49.849 --> 00:27:56.690
killing their entire family that's like

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.789
I think that's who's like actually like

00:27:58.789 --> 00:28:01.369
waging the wars it'd be like this is

00:28:01.369 --> 00:28:02.690
like it's full like gangster [ __ ] just

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:03.949
on a bigger scale they're like it's a

dude bombing a village I was dropping a

00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:09.440
bomb on somebody not a [ __ ] crime

it's like so you're only allowed to blow

00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:14.899
up like airplanes it's like the idea of

00:28:14.899 --> 00:28:17.809

pee in the dark the other night in I

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:19.119
like solemn ear in the dark like a

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:21.760
hard-ass in my basement and then I

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.619
realized everyone was in bed and I'm

00:36:23.619 --> 00:36:25.570
like demon because I'd had to turn the

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:27.940
TV off walk across the basin and go up

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.830
the steps the first date I always

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:32.430
compared to Matt Damon in the elevator

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:38.350
[ __ ] it what's it gonna killing a co-op

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:40.780
Einstein and then I get to the [ __ ]

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:48.040
says I would assume the war in the world

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.710
back room in my basement there was a

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.330
back room right at the foot of the steps

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:55.420
oh yeah there was a door open right at

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.609
the foot of the stairs I do the scariest

00:36:57.609 --> 00:37:05.520
door you think about - is your [ __ ]

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.140

00:38:07.989 --> 00:38:09.970
ton of bees and I would be like I would

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:12.190

very magical thinking if you're dealing

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.839
with you're dealing with partners

00:38:37.839 --> 00:38:39.730
exactly so I would be buzzing through it

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:40.900
dude it was like a [ __ ] perimeter

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.239
gratin crab apples and bees are just

00:38:43.239 --> 00:38:47.019
like hanging on yeah I declared war on

00:38:47.019 --> 00:38:48.940
bees at one point when I was little me

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.470
my cousins killed as many of them

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:54.369
possible but now they're gone yeah it

00:38:54.369 --> 00:38:55.539
was weird though because I we like

00:38:55.539 --> 00:38:57.190
killed [ __ ] tons we literally had a

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:58.690
little like we would put him in little

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.130
like camps and make him like Phi T we

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:01.359
rattle them up and they'd fight each

00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:05.650
other oh you guys genocided dude wearing

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.509
the stripes like curiously when I wanted

00:39:07.509 --> 00:39:08.680
to see if they we were like make them

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.029
fight but shake them in a bottle and

00:39:10.029 --> 00:39:10.960
they they would actually see if they

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.730
fight each other it's pretty sick did

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:14.859
they they were like crawl around on each

00:39:14.859 --> 00:39:16.239
other we try to get a spider to fight in

00:39:16.239 --> 00:39:18.279
my time dude I had spider fights did you

00:39:18.279 --> 00:39:20.650
really I was old I was just like out of

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:21.560
college

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.850
weeks ago yeah I was working at this

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.680
restaurant and we had those clear to go

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.190
containers you spot I'll collect spiders

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:31.710
shake them up never fought they never

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:34.290
fought yeah I definitely just

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:39.060
conscientious objectors spiders it's

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.260
like spiders can go months without

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:44.760
eating we buried a grasshopper in a

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.840
sandbox one time

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.580
dude it was in there for like [ __ ]

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.260
six days we literally put a tiny capsule

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.630
and buried it in sand dug it up six days

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:56.520
later I think hopped right away put bugs

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.610
in the freezer you crazy

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:01.080
I never done put em in the freezer they

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.550
come they come out of it like nothing

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.350
ever had in people I've seen a bunch of

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.180
people online like you freeze bumble

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:12.480
bees funniest cliffs when that thing

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:18.000
wakes up so this is uh talking about

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.740
sleep paralysis the others at Friday

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.900
night I'm like I can't go to bed if I'm

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.850
too high or otherwise I wake up like I

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.250
kind of freaked out so I'm listening to

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:28.050
this thing it was that it was funny I'm

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:29.190
laughing at the fact that I was

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.870
listening to this now because I used to

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:32.460
watch a ton of Terence Mckenna stuff I

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.500
don't know he is he's just like real it

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.580
was a guy who came up with the stone

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:40.590
Dave theory said yeah that's that's the

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.660
so I'm like dude he it was I mean it was

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.060
unbelievable as him at the young society

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.860
so I'm like all my interests are just

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.390
collide in this 3-hour clip this is

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.990
fantastic

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:51.000
yeah so I'm like before I go too high

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.200
too late go to bed so I'm just watching

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.970
[ __ ] Terence Mckenna talk of the

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.410
young society on my youtube just

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:57.450
listening to it I fell asleep and when I

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.330
woke up it was in that like like kind of

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:02.610
like weird sleep paralysis state no

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:05.010
[ __ ] [ __ ] I just see his face

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.260
like a hollow cuz I'm like dreaming kind

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.120
of awake so when I wake up from that

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:13.110
I'll hallucinate things for like okay

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:15.330
yeah I'll literally wake up and

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.130
hallucinate a thing for like five

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.780
seconds and then it just goes away so I

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.060
woke up see a talking face just like

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:24.960
floating above my face I'm like look a

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.970
detailed face yes dude like it was

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:28.440
almost like a hologram popping out of my

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.120
phone but it's just like a weird sleep

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.470
paralysis thing we're like I'll wake up

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:33.980
and like a quasi waits on a drugs

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.810
[Music]

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.390
but it happens though when I fall asleep

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:42.250
and then wake up I'll like see [ __ ] I

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:45.320
think that's lucid dreaming yeah but it

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.240
kind of happens while I'm awake it's

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.770
weird like one part of my brain I don't

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.200
like a [ __ ] what's the animal I think a

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.990
seal I'm gonna say won't know it's a

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.330
whale stick with us because whales dude

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.850
whales and dolphins I think one half of

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.770
their brain sleeps at a time because

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.780
they can't they can't fully sleep all

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.130
their leg doing that [ __ ] so like one

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:05.510
half of the brain sleep from their own

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.980
half a brain and the other half sleeves

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:11.000
they kind of like nice not dude every

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.520
single organism sleeps huh no one really

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.070
yes every organism sleeps even they say

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.440
even down to like like a bacteria that's

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.210
what I mean it'll have like they call

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.560
them inactive states they can't like

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.320
test like obviously brainwave they have

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.450
inactive states where they stop it's

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.250
literally it's like we get back to work

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:38.000
- giving you colon cancer back to

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.320
destroy well not maybe not new but the

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.030
one I saw is newer on sleep paralysis

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:46.010
it's the same thing every time yeah

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:48.619
everyone when they draw what they saw

00:42:48.619 --> 00:42:51.740
it's the same the booshka yeah now that

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.830
[ __ ] or the babadook this [ __ ]

00:42:54.830 --> 00:43:00.050
slender black yeah yeah jacked this guy

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:02.390
just a long skinny guy I got Ronnie

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.340
Coleman I just got Ron Perlman's dude I

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.540
just got three Ronnie Coleman who's I

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.130
just around my bed that's with the

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:08.840
towels like work do the Taliban was

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.580
waking up just waking up with like three

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.540
dudes like there's videos a line of

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.790
there's studies of it there was this one

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:22.609
/ people are averaging there's been

00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:25.100
cases of like I think it was like three

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.650
to five times within a seven day span of

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:29.690
getting it it's just like I didn't know

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:31.310
it was like that I I didn't know

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.090
anything people have chronic pain to me

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:36.710
so they're talking about different ways

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:38.210
to fight it I remember when we watch

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:39.680
that at the old house and we watch that

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.840
all that documentary on Netflix and like

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.180
I was way off on how to stop that

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.470
because they were like yeah well I tried

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:47.360
this changing a diet trying

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.400
stuff your routine before going to bed I

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.530
don't think any of it really helped them

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:53.630
yeah maybe kind of slips in the down I

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:56.360
was like my solution was just like I

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.550
would you know my kid I'll [ __ ] you up

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:01.310
yeah fight the [ __ ] that's my solution

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.650
was to go ahead and I never came back I

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:17.860
was really a [ __ ] sakes get [ __ ] by

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.240
somebody got away with a real smooth me

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:40.850
to was wearing a weird sweater you can

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:42.350
do to get yourself into that state we're

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:43.730
like if you have sleep paralysis your

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:46.070
whole body goes like they say just start

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:49.640
trying to move varies like your fingers

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.740
and like your toes or just trying to eat

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:52.730
your body because you're literally

00:44:52.730 --> 00:45:02.950
paralyzed I just go I was naked hiding

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.570
but if you go into it you have lucid

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:07.340
dreams if you can go like [ __ ] I'm

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.020
going in you start lucid dreaming and

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:10.370
you get into an inception loop where you

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:12.200
wake up think you lose you're not awake

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.760
go back sleep wake up the year wake not

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.110
awake you have like 40 of those and you

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:16.640
finally wake up here like I'd be so

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:36.370
whole attack at the creek was [ __ ]

01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:38.170
