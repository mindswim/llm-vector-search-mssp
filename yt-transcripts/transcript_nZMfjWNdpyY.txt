trainer get a trench coat man yeah i

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.399
could oh i could be a trainer i'd get

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:55.920

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.320
like on the d train i came and then

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.600
the doors would shut and you'd be gone

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.120
yeah they'd make movies

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.040
like he like we didn't even know like we

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.440
were on we were on his tail for years

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.440
and we just couldn't catch him you could

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.959
do a thing where like you could walk

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:15.680
around and then be done coming

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.519
what is happening right now

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:19.200
should we leave now just imagine what

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.600
this episode was without these

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.360

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.880
i'm giving full credit to the mustache

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.200
right now

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:29.839

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:32.320
back to you guys episode was it stuff

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.880
that is it wasn't sexual obviously it

wasn't tawdry no that would have been

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.399
odd if it was just me and him in this

might just be a little kid's room i

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:47.760

didn't go too much when i was still in

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.480
new york and then when i went home for a

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.560
bit and i would just do podcasts where i

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.279
was whispering because like your mom

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:31.279

i kind of i like when they kiss a lot

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.120
and then you come upstairs

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.920
then she takes out his big heart

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.839

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:46.800
you were finished

to cry or get emotional in the air in a

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.279

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:31.199
which i've been ripped open by multiple

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:32.880
movies including the mr rogers

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.079
documentary

00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:36.560
and a place beyond the pines made me

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.800
openly cry on an overnight flight

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.360
i openly cried in my mind to [ __ ] the

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.839
beauty and the beast uh live reaction

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:45.519
why wouldn't why wouldn't you it's a

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:47.680
beautiful story

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.440
oh the greatest stop raping her you

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.759
can't definitely cry the greatest show i

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:53.199
cried in the gravestone on a plane what

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:55.120
about barnum and bailey not only did i

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.680
cry on that flight as soon as it ended

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.800
as soon as you get to go to l.a

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.480
because this guy this guy really i

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.240
watched it right again really you ran it

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.920
back i ran it right i got to watch that

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.800
guy torture tigers again

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.959
i could have watched him rip the teeth

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:12.639
out of old black women and say that

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:13.759
they're what that was something he

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:17.120
actually did yeah george washington

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:19.440
like this old black woman who they said

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.360
was like the oldest woman alive and it

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.120
was just some woman whose teeth you'd

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.079
ripped out

00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:27.040
ah yeah what a thing though

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.120
exact conversion is a lot more fun dude

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.160
no one talks about how wild circuses

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.480
must have been in like the 20s

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.440
that was a

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.519
the better attraction is not come see

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:44.480
the oldest woman in the world that's

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.720
come see me rip the tv

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.800
it was and then carney just got a bad

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.040
rap it's like yeah i've been tortured

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.759
for sure 40 years i tried meth i'm sorry

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:55.680
i have a beard but i've been locked away

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.440
in captivity for

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.120
this is correct specifically in the 20s

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.639
when they could just go with wherever

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:02.880
they wanted they were like hey i'm

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.079
starting to think about doing this

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.919
traveling show and it's a bunch of

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:07.600
elephants that we kick the [ __ ] out of

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.919
and then it's a bunch of weird people

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:11.199
i'd like to see the footage of those

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:13.919
guys just teeing off on those elephants

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:16.079
like a stick

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:17.439
they're up there dude figure out how to

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:19.600
dance yeah [ __ ] hit it

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.520
figure it out hit him until something

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.919
happens also like trying out what works

00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:26.079
for abuse you know this pool cue does

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.520
nothing

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.120
and then one of those things going wild

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.600
in an old town

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.720
you guys are also talking about my

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.360
recommended sidebar on youtube

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.520
elephant stomps trainer

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.120
they're the best dude no here's the best

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.640
one for real

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.280
indians and then jaguars get lost in

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.720
their towns

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.480
and then the whole town comes out so

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.400
there's thousands of people and a jaguar

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.880
just pops out

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.720
there's two great ones there's a jaguar

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.880
that pops out of a roof

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.880
it's so funny and then there's one where

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.240
it's just out of pool and it's team

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.559
jaguars

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.160
oh i've seen this

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.840
unbelievable watch the roof one because

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.160
the first guy swings a stick at it and

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.520
it's the best thing in the world the

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.280
lowest effort you've ever seen they're

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.480
not paying attention look at that

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.890
there's guys looking away

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.039
[Laughter]

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:34.640
look at this i mean it's a whole town

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.160
almost it really takes a village to kill

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.640
a jaguar

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.039
jaguars are too agile yeah i mean you

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:42.799
can't [ __ ] a jaguar is gonna win a

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:45.760
hundred times out of a hundred

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.760
hold that door by the way absolutely

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.400
i can understand anyone yelling weird in

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.080
that video because there's no way i

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.960
would be cool around a

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.840
there's a guy sitting next to the hole

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.840
that it pops out of looking the other

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.480
way when it pops out he's like oh [ __ ]

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.799
it just

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.039
[Laughter]

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.480
thank god you don't live in a place like

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.160
that huh

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.720
dude being surprised by nature just

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.120
walking out would nature be an issue oh

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.320
that's another one of my favorites with

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.840
the the monkey hiding in i don't know

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.039
where this one is but the monkey's

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:31.440
hiding in an alleyway who just he just

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.120
runs out he jumps on anyone and then

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.120
hides back oh yeah anyway yeah and it's

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.640
like this sounds like people just kind

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.520
of like

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.280
slowly trying to figure out if the

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.200
monkey's going to be there that day did

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.960
you just go with like two coffees for

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.200
work and you're like

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.200
today

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.360
yeah dude

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.039
man i think i've put a lot of thought

00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:58.799
into it and i think 80 percent of

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.559
animals could [ __ ] me up if they were

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:02.320
mad at me 80 oh i think that's a low

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.679
number this is a question we've done

00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:05.520
like what's the

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.280
how do we word it what's the biggest the

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.840
fiercest animal you think you could take

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.840
[ __ ] like a like an angry raccoon you

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.039
think you could beat up a restaurant

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:15.280
yeah oh yeah i do hail on a raccoon but

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.559
here's the thing about raccoons united

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:18.640
with your bear paws if they come dude if

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.919
they come

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:21.200
you'd have to get it but here's the

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.039
thing you'd have to

00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:25.200
be cool with getting bit and scratched

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.320
your hands are going to get ripped off

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.840
of course and you're confident you're

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.600
not going to be like ah get away well i

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.720
mean i would definitely do that but is

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.159
this a fight to the death or is it yeah

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.640
hey guys

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.810
hold this real quick

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:51.079
[Applause]

00:20:57.679 --> 00:20:59.200
dude there was a family of them at this

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.880
radio station i worked at

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.520
in tucson no they're not i love them i i

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.440
could i would only get a parking spot

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.039
when i come in for my shift it'd be like

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:08.159
6 p.m

00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:09.679
right by the dumpster where they would

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:11.280
all congregate at night yeah the

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.840
dumpster then at night it was arizona so

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.880
you'd want to leave your windows down

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.640
because you're stuck

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.880
i'd be high as [ __ ] i'm scary dude i'd

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.480
always get into my car wait wait wait

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.240
wait wait you're telling me you would

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.320
park next to a family of raccoons and

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.840
leave your windows down

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.840
i mean that's just

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.480
concocting the worst possible recipe to

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.080
end the workday i would crack i would

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.760
crack the window right and i never

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.440
learned my lesson because then they

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.360
would be like

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.720
there's i'll be eating there with their

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.400
little [ __ ] human hair

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.799
they're all like

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:45.039
and then

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.039
i would come out right i would come out

00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:52.799
in the parking lot at 3am at the end of

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:54.480
my shift and i'd smoke a cigarette at

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.640
the door to hype myself up

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.960
here we

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.520
and then in one movement i try to open

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.200
the door like

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.120
get turn it on and like

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.280
look around yeah yeah but they were

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.559
sometimes they'd be under my car but

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:09.919
they never got my feet

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:12.559
yeah so i was always worried

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:14.320
it's just that yeah

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.919
yeah yeah yeah have you seen the video

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:18.080
of the uh the raccoon whisperer yeah

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.240
yeah

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.720
yeah rules oh with all of them like 40

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.240
every night and he just throws tons of

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.919
hot dogs and grapes and [ __ ] and they're

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:27.760
like little uh human we always used to

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.799
send each other the one where the guy

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:29.760
gets bit

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.640
and he goes hey come here

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.000
yeah

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.720
they're [ __ ] vicious but i you know i

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.400
think i could take it if i had to go

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.480
full on survival mode i would just

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.080
[ __ ] okay

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.120
how high

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.720
i think i just have to bonk it a bunch

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.840
yeah i feel like you're grabbed by the

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.120
tail yeah

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.280
i think you rip that tail off

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.799
but then if it slid out i absolutely

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.279
[Music]

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.000
it will [ __ ] you up you're gonna give no

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.840
no by all these animals but yeah i would

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.679
have to do a forearm i'd have to have

00:23:11.679 --> 00:23:13.280
him get my forearm i think he's gonna

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.880
control him like that you gotta get it

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.799
down its throat you can't even just get

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:18.480
up like you gotta get a little handy

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.480
yeah

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:23.679
these are animals you guys are naming

00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:25.120
small animals you can definitely just

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.039
coyote i think i i think i'm a cowboy

[ __ ] [ __ ] he got to his machine

00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:36.639
you guys are being [ __ ] about venus

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:38.079
what's her what's her weight and [ __ ]

00:34:38.079 --> 00:34:40.480
jeff garcia would wail on venus jeff

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.800
garcia i think i actually i thought he

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.839
kind of disappeared now that i'm

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:45.280
thinking about it he is like back in the

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.960
in the media now i think he's is he

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.240
coaching or is he in the media i think

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.599
he's why does that matter he used to be

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:51.599
a [ __ ] professional football player

00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:53.359
because he's like he's like in shape

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:55.119
still yeah he's in here there are plenty

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:56.480
of quarterbacks who just got fat in

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.680
their [ __ ] mess

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.119
i think jeff garcia is still still

00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:00.480
hitting the weights and things like that

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.800
i don't think any former nfl player

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.000
i'd have to get one with als

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.520

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.320
take matt stafford today

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.320

[ __ ] yeah yeah steve nash

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.240

00:39:41.839 --> 00:39:43.040
out and everyone will feel a little

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.560
relieved yeah they'll never have to take

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.160

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.320

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.599
a trench coat no shirt under it

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:16.160
death is merely an illusion

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.160
what happened to sean taylor he got

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.599
[ __ ] killed by a guy breaking into

00:40:19.599 --> 00:40:21.040
his house he's one of the greatest

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.960
safeties of all time he didn't die i

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.839
don't even know who that is

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.240
yeah dude that's one of those

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.599
like those athletes that die like that

00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:31.520

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.359
to have an awesome bit about you don't

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:35.200
want to see heroes live too long like

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.480
hendricks was like

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.000
early yeah just doing the super bowl

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.680
halftime show with his gut hanging out

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.280
that's the problem watching rappers get

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.119
old you know biggie and paco and it's

00:40:43.119 --> 00:40:45.119
like oh you put them on forever a legend

00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:46.800
you watch rappers who are like i'm

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.400
[ __ ] these hoes and dealing drugs and

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.000
[ __ ] now they're like grandpas oh i

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.160
can't wait for old takashi 6 9.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.680
i don't think we're going to see that

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.560
one yeah

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.720
he's not making it but what if

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.319
he's made it this long i think yeah they

00:41:00.319 --> 00:41:02.160
just forgive him i actually there's

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.280
definitely times where it's been easy

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.040
enough to kill him i think gang gang

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.200
life took a hit like everyone was like

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.960
as soon as takashi six nines out he's

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.640
gonna get murdered he snitched on gangs

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.800
you just die and he just did he just

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.319
just snitched as much as he's saying new

00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:17.440
york gangs are weak apparently

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.960
come at me bro

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.830
[Laughter]

00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:33.760
they would get away with it because the

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.520
cops would be like there's no way you

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.920
could dang couldn't be killed this white

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.720
man that has zero influence with gangs

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.599
pushing his hyundai down the street

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:45.599
yeah dude i um

00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:46.640
i don't know they always say that they

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.079
always say like the mafia is still

00:41:48.079 --> 00:41:49.920
around and like gangs are still around

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.359
but here's a question i don't want to

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:52.720
find out i think that's a cockroach's

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.800
question last week

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.480
how many people

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.240
do you think have been killed this is

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.440
such a dumb question now that i'm

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.720
repeating it yeah how many people do you

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.280
think have been killed by being

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.599
dropped into the ocean like we forced

00:42:05.599 --> 00:42:08.000
you to walk the plank or the mafia

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.359
the bricks on you and throws you into

00:42:09.359 --> 00:42:11.359
the wall well concrete it's a lot i

00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:13.200
don't think okay

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.200
what's a lot because this person

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.200
posited that it was 10

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.599
billion people okay

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:20.720
there's only been like a hundred billion

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.920
people yeah

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.520
what yeah he thinks the ten of people

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.960
that have ever who's this person he's

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.119
just idiotic he was a caller

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:28.480
that was the stupidest answer we've ever

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.520
had in the history of our show i mean

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.880
that's like you just don't know he's a

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.200
pirate he's like i'm telling you it's a

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.280
lot more than you think i kept not just

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.200
below deck yeah you're really

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.160
underselling it

00:42:41.119 --> 00:42:42.640
it's a pretty depressing one but the

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.800
slave trade did have a lot of that yeah

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.319
they would jump off those numbers are a

00:42:46.319 --> 00:42:48.480
lot higher than you did forget the slave

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.240
trade if slave traders were like getting

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.160
arrested or like at sea like a ship was

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.359
coming they dumped their cargo and

00:42:53.359 --> 00:42:55.760
they'd just dump everybody oh [ __ ] like

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.720
that i'd like to revise

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.480
look how much chain has grown and you

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.599
have grown

00:43:13.599 --> 00:43:15.920
you have not grown at all yes and number

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.839
two and then also headline now will be

00:43:17.839 --> 00:43:20.480
shane gillis talks about slaves

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.480
oh [ __ ] but

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.480
yeah i think also

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.079
people travel used to just be like that

00:43:26.079 --> 00:43:27.520
they'd be like the poor people they're

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.040
they're coughing yeah get them out of

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.160
here

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.319
not me sad [ __ ] push them into the

00:43:32.319 --> 00:43:34.319
ocean swim swim

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:36.720
so i would say

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.119
over

00:43:39.359 --> 00:43:41.200
50 million

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.359
i think history of the world i think i

00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:44.720
think even even

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.480
slave trade i don't think you're getting

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.920
no history

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.359
i think well hold on

00:43:49.359 --> 00:43:50.880
are we talking we're not talking

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.000

they're disposable

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.000
i mean obviously i'm from a long line

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.760
what is the most disposable animal you

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.520
think it's a cat

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.680
well i was i was doing what everybody

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.599
that talks about cats does is comparing

01:03:33.599 --> 01:03:34.720
it to dogs

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.000
it's always they're like it's like i

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.559
like cats like really i like dogs

01:03:38.559 --> 01:03:40.240
i like dogs too dude i'm tony i like

i like cats all right dogs [ __ ]

01:03:45.119 --> 01:03:47.039
yeah but cat people oftentimes always

01:03:47.039 --> 01:03:48.960
try to put them over dogs that's where

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.319
they lose a lot of people because that's

01:03:50.319 --> 01:03:51.839
i mean that's just crazy you know it's

01:03:51.839 --> 01:03:54.240

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.799
cat is like a dog yeah

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:58.240
the best compliment you can give a cat

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.400
is it you're like a dog yeah they're

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.599
just that's compliment you can give a

01:04:01.599 --> 01:04:04.480
dog is meat just give it meat

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.640

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.559
compound thing and they had cats

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.000
everywhere every year they would just

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.319
get overrun with fire from what just a

01:04:18.319 --> 01:04:19.599
bunch of cats once you have a couple

01:04:19.599 --> 01:04:21.599

01:04:21.599 --> 01:04:22.960

01:05:41.119 --> 01:05:43.280
it to a brick [ __ ] threw it in there

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.079
what come on dude it's so shoot it's

01:05:46.079 --> 01:05:47.760
difficult yeah shoot it don't make it

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.440
you don't have a gun whatever dude i

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.200
would rather smash it in a bag with a

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.280
hammer and just toss it yeah put it in a

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.839
bag and swing it against you yeah do it

01:05:55.839 --> 01:05:57.760
dude i want instantly throw a cat in the

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.359
water with a break

01:05:59.359 --> 01:06:00.720
what are you gonna teach other cats not

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.839
to snitch

01:06:01.839 --> 01:06:04.720
yeah

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.119
why does it need to be on a brick like

01:06:07.119 --> 01:06:08.480
you probably just go out and just throw

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.599
like the cats

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:11.599
at home but then it really struggles man

01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:12.799
what's this is a quick drowning all

01:06:12.799 --> 01:06:14.319
right here's a good question

01:06:14.319 --> 01:06:16.559
what hurts your conscience

01:06:16.559 --> 01:06:18.480
the least way to kill what's the what's

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.760
the kill what's the easiest way to kill

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.680
a cat a shovel

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:22.960
just one shot

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.200
i think yeah

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.640
i'll tell you i've thrown it off a cliff

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.799
might be easy yo yeah that's great but

01:06:28.799 --> 01:06:31.440
you can hear that

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.920
[Music]

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.319
a [ __ ] one dink with a shovel oh man

01:06:38.319 --> 01:06:39.839

01:06:39.839 --> 01:06:40.960
it like an old

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.400
shovel might actually be tough yeah

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.000
because if you don't hit its back and

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.520
it's just you

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.559

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.520
black lab to put it down and then he

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.280
tried to bury it in the backyard but he

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.520
was a huge dog so it took him like four

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.280
hours ago

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.960

[Music]

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.880
i'm asleep in this grave dude i feel

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.400
like we've got a a lot of good material

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.080
for next skits here

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.759
i don't know if john will like that

01:08:33.759 --> 01:08:35.839
but i do i actually do think that'd be

01:08:35.839 --> 01:08:36.880
funny

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.960
yo you guys are on [ __ ] [ __ ] thank

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.759

[ __ ] funny and i i really would have

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.719
bet that a trump sketch right now would

01:08:46.719 --> 01:08:48.319
have been like uh we're still doing this

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:50.319

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:53.319
trump

01:08:55.839 --> 01:08:58.080
over the top of what he is instead of

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.480
just what he is which is the funniest

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.920
and you know what i think is really the

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.440
funniest thing about that skit it wasn't

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.359
even like the the sex stuff when you

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:06.719

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.600
what are you doing

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.040
they're just over the lifestyle they're

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.400
over the [ __ ] they don't know [ __ ]

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.080
happens other stuff also there is a

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.080
period where it does suck

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.640
like a long period the whole time until

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.840

01:10:47.679 --> 01:10:49.679
yeah it sucks a lot and so when you see

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:51.040
people quit that are really good it's a

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.880
bummer because you're like damn because

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.719

01:10:54.719 --> 01:10:56.560
going

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.920

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.760
yeah yeah but mckeever's stopped

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.440
definitely he just likes directing and

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:04.800
acting yeah and he's unbelievable the

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.880
way those are shot those sketches man

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.800
it's hard when a friend makes a sketch

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.640
and the lighting sucks and the sound is

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.159
off and it's directed terribly and then

01:11:12.159 --> 01:11:13.760
you got to be like

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.199
i always do like a i see what you're

01:11:15.199 --> 01:11:16.719
going for so these are awesome they're

01:11:16.719 --> 01:11:18.719
just the reluctant chairs

01:11:18.719 --> 01:11:20.080
oh is there anything worse when your

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.920
friend puts out something shitty oh my

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:26.159

know it's also like if if you know that

01:12:12.239 --> 01:12:13.920
group of guys they had this unbelievable

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.600
pilot at comedy central called delco

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.400
proper yeah and it was like you watch it

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.080

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.280
right it's good

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.600

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.679
all the guys that's how john is with

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:28.000
acting too yeah like he was with standup

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.920
he's probably the best in our group of

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.960
friends that actually when he came in

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.239
and played your and he doesn't like

01:12:32.239 --> 01:12:34.239
doing it your partner in the cop

01:12:34.239 --> 01:12:36.239
sleeping cop sketch he kills it he's so

01:12:36.239 --> 01:12:37.760
good kills it

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.360
yeah what happened to that is the pilot

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.640
just didn't get picked up because now i

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.239
just got picked up by comedy central and

01:12:42.239 --> 01:12:44.320
then they didn't do anything

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.520
i think they killed it i don't know

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.880
because nowadays it just feels like you

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.560

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.080
