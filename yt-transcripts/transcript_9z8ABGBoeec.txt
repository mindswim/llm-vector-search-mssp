used to do when I was drinking is I

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.629
would strip down and get buck naked and

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.340
wrestle my buddies that's a good move

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.229
naked wrestling's good they don't want

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:04.489
to touch it because I just like come on

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.169

looking for a black guy about this high

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.880
anywhere from 511 to 65 that's dangerous

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.550
yeah I walked into the bar that was

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.289
there and it was an all-black bar that's

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.880

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.409
that river country to make jokes about

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.130
that so I go into the bar and I'm

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.479
spinning guys around

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.190

oh is that my [ __ ] jacket and I open

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:28.550
one guy's vest and started rifling

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.050
through his pockets to see if it was my

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.650
ID

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.479
holy [ __ ] and when I realized it wasn't

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.009

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.279
mistaken identity and and once he sees

the most part of getting in a fight

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.860
African

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.870

because I hated the army but it was also

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.309
it was just football I hated playing

00:21:00.309 --> 00:21:03.669
Division 1 football soccer so bad they

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:05.289
were at me they were like don't worry

00:21:05.289 --> 00:21:06.640
dude the military stuff sucks but

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.830
football is a nice escape yeah I was

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.450
like dude get me back to the [ __ ]

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.450
drills dude football sucks football I'm

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.190
getting my ass kicked right like that

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.500
was real ass beating right first it's

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.539
like boot camp that was easy so would

00:21:19.539 --> 00:21:20.679
you say that you get your ass kicked

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:22.570
more in football training than any fight

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.850
you've ever been and undoubtedly really

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.549
yeah you get fight I mean dad was just

00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:28.120
showing him

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.530
picture the dude I had to block every

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.510
day right I got drafted by the Jaguars

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.610
and he was a he was an animal dude

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.950
that's the thing you want these guys get

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.870
[ __ ] their bell rung during a game

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.940
and you're like oh man I could never get

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.710
up from that but it's like day in and

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.090
day out yeah yeah they're just big

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.160
forces of nature slammed into each other

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.470
like buffaloes and it's it also is funny

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:48.880
I mean that's the right attitude to have

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.320
like when you watch college or pro

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.270
football and you see somebody get laid

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.220
out you need to know that you couldn't

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.240
get up there's so many people out there

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.910
that I can't catch the [ __ ] ball yeah

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.010
it's like dude you would die do not

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.500
because I remember just getting hit with

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.210
my head down yeah and like getting

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.290
robbed

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.420
yes sucks rocked and then and then

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.640
feeling like those football hits are so

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.520
much harder like Texas high school

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.590
football yeah yeah you're just watching

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.210
Friday Night Lights but if you really

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.550
watch them oh yeah pretty a Gears breeze

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.770
these guys these kids are bred for this

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:25.600
yeah I wonder how many kids like how

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.160
many of you guys have the opportunity of

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.540
the highlights are just going home

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:29.170
concussed

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:33.550
oh yeah until like even when I was in

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.260
college there was really no and that was

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.620
like 2011 2010 there was still no

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.440
protocol for concussions really like no

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.940
one really gave a [ __ ] it was only until

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.270
a little after that that but anyway I

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.050
actually what am I talking about was

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.650
like 2008 but um so I was in Newark and

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:58.360
I hung it yeah yeah I smell salt I would

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.310
hang out with you know the football team

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.290
so it's us and we way this is at Elon

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.480
University which is like kind of a

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.200
preppy school so it's like southern Bros

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.450
with like neon khaki shorts that are

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:15.070
like short shorts [ __ ] pastel we used

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.240
to [ __ ] run a train on these kids

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.970
bowties [ __ ] like pink pastel

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.630
button-downs all that [ __ ] boat shoes

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.730
swoop hair the ultimate [ __ ] douche

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.830
but and then the football team was

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.030
recruited from all over the country

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.430
mostly the south but like Letty did you

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.260
ever meet Letty he's from Philly he's a

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.160
[ __ ] animal

there's guys from like Jersey these all

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.600
these animals we got to fight one time

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.799

France

00:23:45.489 --> 00:23:47.169

00:23:47.169 --> 00:23:49.239

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:55.509
elbow jobs the football team was so much

00:23:55.509 --> 00:23:56.919
bigger and stronger than these guys it

00:23:56.919 --> 00:23:58.419
was actually like you could do wrestling

00:23:58.419 --> 00:24:00.629
moves

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:10.929

00:25:23.169 --> 00:25:24.460
year of high school we had a deck hockey

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.289
team at a place called family fun spot

00:25:26.289 --> 00:25:28.989
what's a deck hockey team that's a way

00:25:28.989 --> 00:25:32.980
North Americans say it sounds like sake

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.980
okay but like on foam it's like real

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.980
like regulation ring all that stuff but

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.440
like all you wear is like this street

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:41.830
hockey

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.840

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.999
other yes pretty much wait I understand

00:25:45.999 --> 00:25:48.129
what is this so like it's street hockey

00:25:48.129 --> 00:25:51.220
like but it's a real ring oh okay like

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.539
anybody from Delta would know it it's

00:25:52.539 --> 00:25:53.230
good

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:54.280
that place is still around but it's

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.660
called family fun spot and these have

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.049
two rings and rinks so I keep saying

00:25:59.049 --> 00:26:10.030
rings [ __ ] [ __ ] dude Donald Trump

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.400
and footballs all we [ __ ] with here suck

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:19.059
our dick skater so anyway we uh yeah we

00:26:19.059 --> 00:26:22.840
came out we were idiots at senior year

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.460
of high school we had a team and we

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.040
would go out and play and the one time

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.809
we had to play Glen Mills which is the

00:26:28.809 --> 00:26:31.179
local high school where they send the

00:26:31.179 --> 00:26:33.820
bay kids so they roll up in like two

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.850
busses they have shifts we have 9s holes

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.010
on our half in a bag from when they left

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.799
six period like an hour ago so we are

00:26:41.799 --> 00:26:44.860
getting crushed but they can't hit us

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.660
because then they'll get in trouble

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.460
because they have the [ __ ] cops there

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.440
whatever so we just start beating the

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.940
[ __ ] out of them and I've never felt

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.590
more powerful my life like these dudes

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.860
are massive and they know they're like

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.460

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:06.070
[ __ ] kill you like it is here these

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.320
guys I like juvie

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.960
it's like you I felt like Necessary

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.760
Roughness when the jail came to play

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.309

00:27:15.309 --> 00:27:22.809

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.510
don't even try and fire back if you want

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:31.670

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.810
played that game and then the next game

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.870
was a bunch of [ __ ] idiot firemen and

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.180
day laborers so we go into that game

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.920
like [ __ ] yeah dude we just taught we

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:54.500
lost 14 nothing but I was like this guy

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.740
stinks so we get in the game opening

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.630
faceoff um never forget as my buddy bone

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.190

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:02.690
down like this the guy in front of me

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.460
cuz I like this in a metal bowl comes

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.740
down and the wreck blows the whistle

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:16.940

alright the ref had to call timeout and

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.360
then at this point there's all these

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.520
standing rumors above the rink so all of

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.230
our parents were there I'll never forget

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.840

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.370
hacking at us and like hitting us

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.900

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.280
like playing men oh yeah oh yeah yeah

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.600

had a broken eye he'd broken wrists so

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.730
what we did but he was our best flier so

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:10.040
we put a cast her be put a glove on him

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.240
like a lacrosse oh the refs couldn't see

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.940
it and whatever well they were beating

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.110
the [ __ ] out of him because they

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.660
obviously knew he was his best and the

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.520
parents are all yelling hey take it easy

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.440
down there but we start getting like

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.240
real serious and like we're like dude

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.070
[ __ ] these guys are half in a bag let's

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.840
start hitting them so sue remember this

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.130
is a big part of the story there's

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.900
netting that goes all around like almost

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.130
behind like

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:35.720
Phil grill post yeah yeah we know no

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.450
hockey works I know you do but anyway

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:42.740
they're behind that so at one point will

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.710
gets crushed like in keep in mind this

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:47.510
isn't you know it's just standing there

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:49.370
he gets crushed into the boards and he

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.160
goes down so we lose it and like we

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.890
start hitting with sticks and we're uh

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:55.970
still trying to break it up this and the

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.820
other thing we didn't see will go down

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.010
he gets up he has his glove off with the

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.370
cast and just goes this guys [ __ ]

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:09.049
face explodes like nose in twenty pieces

00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:11.539
and he did the vessels his face cuz

00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:13.460
Wilden fight like he wasn't a fighter

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.740

00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:46.279
to the other recording but it's you know

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:47.659
what it's only because I just told the

00:31:47.659 --> 00:31:50.539
story last night and how we got into

00:31:50.539 --> 00:31:53.869
before Brian was telling a story about a

00:31:53.869 --> 00:31:55.009
little guy that got beat up at a car

00:31:55.009 --> 00:31:59.119

00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:01.639
this story and it's it's so legendary

00:32:01.639 --> 00:32:04.100
back home there was this kid who was

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.320

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.240
little rich kid like Jane ugh yes

exactly

00:32:11.659 --> 00:32:13.730

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:17.570

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:19.429
[ __ ] the phone was on he's great yeah

00:32:19.429 --> 00:32:21.799
that's my bike and knock would devastate

00:32:21.799 --> 00:32:30.740
this kid but he's small in a [ __ ] sky

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.340
full of black people yeah yeah so so

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.419
this kid Beecroft is like probably 411

00:32:37.419 --> 00:32:40.340
110 pounds and he's a little a little

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.440
bit of a [ __ ] but whatever so and

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.600
there was this other kid Curtis Curtis

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.200
is like six seven you know you don't

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.240
really like built like a [ __ ] picture

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.879
you know not not huge but six seven so

00:32:52.879 --> 00:32:55.129
at this party Curtis pins down Pete

00:32:55.129 --> 00:32:56.929
Croft pulls his pants down and just

00:32:56.929 --> 00:32:59.029
starts [ __ ] filling his [ __ ] with

00:32:59.029 --> 00:33:12.590
marshmallows high school yeah the guy

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.779
that's physically disabled I'm gonna

00:33:14.779 --> 00:33:17.869
rape him at the party and that's what

00:33:17.869 --> 00:33:20.269
and I'm telling my wife this story who's

00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:22.549
ready for a party I'm gonna raise this

00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:23.820
kid

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:27.450
dude that's the [ __ ] point of a story

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.100
you know it's like as like oh man this

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.200
reminds me this hilarious story and I

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.239
tell her that part and she goes oh so he

00:33:33.239 --> 00:33:45.299
was raped just got screwed out of a

00:33:45.299 --> 00:33:47.489
national title in 93 oh yeah this is

00:33:47.489 --> 00:33:49.350
this is a great time to be alive her

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.119
name was on the precipice of

00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:53.759
Championships raping kids was legal yeah

00:33:53.759 --> 00:33:56.159
[ __ ] Kobe break that chicks but there

00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:57.869
was nothing it was no your age that was

00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:02.009
significantly later but I think Kobe got

00:34:02.009 --> 00:34:03.960
accused of I think what Kobe did was put

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.119
a marshmallow in a girl yeah he

00:34:06.119 --> 00:34:07.739
marshmallow - girl you know what it

00:34:07.739 --> 00:34:08.879
probably couldn't get it out and she's

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:10.770
like now it's now it's stuck it's too

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:12.270
much but I think they actually ended up

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:13.829
finding other people's marshmallows in

00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:22.770
there 24 hours somebody else's

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:23.909
marshmallows were in there you're

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:28.020
blaming Kobe so so I'm telling my wife

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.000
this story and the reason it had even

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.250
like occurred to me because I was naked

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:34.649
shoving a preparation age suppository up

00:34:34.649 --> 00:34:36.990
my ass and I was like oh this reminds me

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:39.000
of this story in high school yeah how

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.470
about how about though when your butt

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:42.809

00:34:42.809 --> 00:34:45.270

thing preparation age I did once it yeah

00:34:54.599 --> 00:34:57.089
why I bought one pack I did a bunch of

00:34:57.089 --> 00:35:00.150
time but this is actually I don't even

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:03.349
have hemorrhoids and this is something

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:08.750
[Laughter]

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.339
melted on me at a show last night and I

00:35:11.339 --> 00:35:13.049
was like literally I was in the bathroom

00:35:13.049 --> 00:35:14.880
when I was in pain and it melted and I

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.710
was like oh [ __ ] and I felt like like

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:20.450
[ __ ] Trainspotting like sick boy from

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.780
yeah I hey let me get this this is going

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.880
alright so I was in North Carolina the

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.280
same with the football team we were out

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.530
my friend was fighting we would fight

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.079
the locals we get a lot of fights yeah

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:36.119
it's a football team yeah so we were out

00:35:36.119 --> 00:35:37.640
fighting these kids

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.089
outside this party and I I didn't know

00:35:41.089 --> 00:35:43.910
it but one of that kids friends I guess

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.549
was standing next to me cuz he saw me I

00:35:46.549 --> 00:35:47.900
was drunk I was cheering on the fight I

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.539
was having a good this I reached in my

00:35:50.539 --> 00:35:52.579
back pocket it reminded me because I was

00:35:52.579 --> 00:35:54.650
you'd said skull I've reached back to

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.710
get my dip and I guess the kid thought I

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.200
was getting a gun is what he said

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.329
right but as soon as I reached in my

00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:04.640
back pocket to get my dip he [ __ ]

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.440
swung and just hit me in the face right

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:06.710
away

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:10.999
and this is I mean I've never fought

00:36:10.999 --> 00:36:18.890
anybody my size some great rules number

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:20.690
one was never getting a fight you think

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:24.049
you could lose and number two is never

00:36:24.049 --> 00:36:32.450
fight a wrestler know you know but

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.099
anyway oh and number three was always

00:36:34.099 --> 00:36:36.109
throw the first punch yes which is

00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:37.880
hilarious because that means my dad just

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.739
cheap shot at a bunch of small pawn you

00:36:42.739 --> 00:36:44.239
wrestle the guy was like no he's like

00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:48.349
[ __ ] anyway so this guy punches me in

00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:50.239
the face which also I've never I've

00:36:50.239 --> 00:36:52.339
never followed that rule at all every

00:36:52.339 --> 00:36:53.749
single fight I've been in I've been

00:36:53.749 --> 00:36:55.999
punched in the face first okay but every

00:36:55.999 --> 00:36:58.880
single fight by a small guy but this guy

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.099
punched me in the face so now this

00:37:01.099 --> 00:37:04.190
circle surrounds us and some somehow I

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.930
just they had worked out like when I

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:08.569
grabbed him he just fell perfectly at my

00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:14.710
feet so I'm standing he fell sitting

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.989
like Indian style facing outwards so

00:37:17.989 --> 00:37:19.730
we're both facing the same way and

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:22.130
somehow his legs err his back's just

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:25.069
against my like shins and I was able to

00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:27.829
just hold his hair with my one hand and

00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:29.989
punch the side of his face with my other

00:37:29.989 --> 00:37:33.289
hand you just made with a [ __ ] motion

00:37:33.289 --> 00:37:40.100
like I held this heritage right there
