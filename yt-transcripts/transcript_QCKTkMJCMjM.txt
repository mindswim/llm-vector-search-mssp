00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.520
black cat drop a sandwich almost every

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.240

connecticut soldiers sucked and [ __ ]

00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:03.440
on both sides

actually

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.520
no this time it helped no it was

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.080
connected they they they lured them in

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.960
well the night before the union sent

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.400
like a trojan horse they sent the

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.400
connecticut boys over little did they

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.840

venereal diseases oh no and they sucked

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:26.000
and [ __ ] all the confederates and so

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.080
that's what we can and they confess

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.200
tuckered out

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.960
aids actually back then this is one of

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.280

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.480
around which is way less they're easier

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.159
to get they even know that germs like

00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:50.240
existed at this point hardly they had an

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.400
idea they had a hankering germs are like

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.600
conspiracy theory they're like there's

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.280
an invisible world of beings that infect

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.799

night yeah you're talking about it you

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:54.639
came to check on us i wasn't sure what

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.320
it was going through your mind at that

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.800
point the night i don't know i was

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.560
shane's pretty sturdy he's a pretty

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.000
psychologically sturdy dude so i was

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.680
like i'm sure he's fine

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.359
but he yeah you know every once in a

00:35:05.359 --> 00:35:07.839
while you guys are worried about my dad

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.599
like when we were in england

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:12.320
chris was like i'm certain he's dead

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.079
but that was that was cocaine that's

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:16.480
different yeah yeah do it but no he i

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.760
was like i know he's fine on the

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.000
mushrooms but you know i'm like

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.079
there's a chance he's just awake just

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:23.599
staring at the ceiling because like dude

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:25.520
we got back you can run yeah you can

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.880
find me doing that yes

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.520
every few nights anyway true that's true

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.359
i was like i was just going like knock

00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:33.599
knock being like yo if you guys are

00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:34.960
thinking you're trapped in your room you

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.040
can't come out we have the [ __ ] you

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.720
know we had the ashram going dude in

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.520
room

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.599
seven twenty four were you thinking ever

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:44.079
about like calling the paramedics not

00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:45.680
dude so getting

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.359
getting some type of authority involved

00:35:47.359 --> 00:35:48.560
this is the weirdest part because on

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.960
mushrooms that to me is the scariest so

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.119
here's here's here's the layout so we're

00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:54.800
you guys dipped out i mean it was like

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.000
two o'clock they dipped down in a

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.760
reasonable time so we were we're

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.880
munching the mushrooms one good thing

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.200
about my lady she she passes out that's

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.800
the best thing about it she likes it yes

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.760
yes because otherwise i would have

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.839
stayed there thursday nights

00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:08.079
their battery pack is like an hour

00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:09.599
shorter than ours and they'll drag you

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:11.280
to bed and you're like oh thank god well

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.960
we'd get there and she'd order a drink

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.240

you pick at mushrooms you pick them yeah

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.040
and they add up so you think it's just

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.119
worst thing you you just pick at them

00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:58.320
just a little bit and you keep doing

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.160
that that's how i am with just about you

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.400
got cut off every drug all that stuff

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.119
yeah

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:04.240
just like

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.839
well it hasn't hit yet i'll just keep

00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:07.599
eating it and keep eating it and then

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:09.920
next thing you know dude so everyone

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.119
there was eating them so we're sitting

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:12.720
there at the bar you guys leave and i'm

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.119
watching i'm watching your lady

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:17.200
[ __ ] yeah she's got space boots on so

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.640
i'm like it'll be all right you know

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.000
it'll be fine it wasn't we didn't eat

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.040
that much

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.480
although spaced out between a lot of

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.599
people

00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:25.599
you know so everyone's drinking i have a

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:26.960
theory too you know people do lemon tech

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.800
with mushrooms so if you put mushrooms

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.440
in lemon juice it breaks down psilocybin

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.880
into silicon which is the thing that

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.480
actually makes you trip that's why

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.560
people get belly aches because it's a

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.240
lot of work to break it down but if you

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.760
have an acidic thing it breaks it down

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.599
for you and it kicks in way quicker i

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:43.599
have a theory that alcohol does that too

00:37:43.599 --> 00:37:45.119
so every time i've drank and eaten

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:46.560
mushrooms they kick in in like 25

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.240
minutes yeah so the first little bit

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.200
kicked in i'm like you know we're

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.040
sitting having a good time we're talking

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.119
more tequila shots more champagne which

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:55.839
was just hilarious and andrew the owner

00:37:55.839 --> 00:37:57.680
of the goose he was so excited like that

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.359
he's so yeah i think the champagne might

00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:00.400
have been it because it's probably

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.160
keeping everything moving and breaking

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.720
up spreading it out you know it dude

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.560
sounds like a grinder all of it came

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.920
into play these mushrooms kicked in and

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.280
then we had then you had a little more

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.240
so i was like whatever i'll just eat

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.599
whatever you eat you know like we'll

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:12.960
have fun so i just like let me stay in

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.920
place

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.440
was it that casual or was it more

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.200
competitive that was casual i didn't

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.040
even notice my on my back it was for my

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.960
bachelor party i had to do the five gram

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.400
two weeks after that so i didn't partake

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.920
in mushrooms with everyone i felt bad

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.079
about that right so i was like not again

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:27.359

00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:28.480

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.640
um

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.720

00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:13.920
dad from the elks really each night i

every night yeah

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.400
yeah just focus intensely batting down

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.000
that was the alcohol dude otherwise i'd

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.760
be careful the weed and mushrooms had me

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.599

00:42:27.599 --> 00:42:30.319
something crazy for your boys yeah

00:42:30.319 --> 00:42:32.160
so it dude it was the whole ordeal was

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.079
like maybe two and a half minutes that's

00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:35.440
how close this was so i just moved i

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.040
like golf carted us back to point a to

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.920
point b so we get into the hotel and at

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.920
this point there was a point c

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.599
true a little detour right about that

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:45.280
yeah to make a little three-point turn

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.920
pretty good but the uh dude so we go up

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.160
into the hotel and by this point

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.880
i'm i felt like i was ascending like

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.640
