00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.040
shamed last

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.360
last week i was apparently making it a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.079
little too heavy

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.920

hanging out

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.479
um vitalberg did the unthinkable today

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.560
and he worked out what in the middle of

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.600
like the work day

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.960
he came back in here it looked like he

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.119
had gone to war so he was literally he

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.320
was sitting on it he was like this

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.000
i thought he was on heroin when i walked

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.600
into the bar you guys said nothing

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.280
been working out right or no i took a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.799
break but what happened was so we're

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.920
in a weight loss challenge um and the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.160
first two weeks i took it very seriously

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.840
i went sober i wasn't drinking i was

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.680
working out and i gained weight

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.680
so then the next week i went back to not

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.040
working out and drinking i lost five

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.840
pounds

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.599
so i've been sticking with that honestly

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.280
that is like your body

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.200
is is just reversed from like normal

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.400
humans where it's like this is what we

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.920
need to function well

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.440
and you deprive it's like you know you

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.280

healthy

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.520

progress and i just haven't

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.800

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.599

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.660
[Laughter]

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.280
no but i didn't stop because of that i

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.720
was still working out until the gym shut

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.599
down

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.599
i put out a workout video mark fifth

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.280
last year i believe i don't deny that

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.239
but like you were touching the tism as

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:04.600
well

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.560
[Laughter]

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.799
you were you were putting out what now i

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.400
put out a video of like me working out

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.080
like early march and like

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.760
dave's stuff was like mid-january was it

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.280
was it was like oh yeah it was a joke i

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.600
don't know

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.479
like i got scared like i told willy like

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.079
that i could hang some muscle on his

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.759
like skinny little frame

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.720
okay all right but yeah when you were

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.240
like looking good dave didn't like that

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.800
and and

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.479
you might have kept working out but you

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.800
you took your foot off the gas

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.520
yeah yeah it wasn't a total stop but it

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.199
certainly slowed the momentum a little

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.720
bit yeah

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.360
you know these whoop things yeah i mean

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.639
so i'm in a group with a couple of

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.400
professional hockey players that when

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.440
their stats are

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.360
no but like i want to see how different

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.479
i was going to be right

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.400
so i'm laying in bed the other day and i

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.040
was a three-point hero [ __ ] car

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.800
i'm a 3.8 strain right and and my hrv

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.919
was a 27

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.600
you and all of a sudden they look at me

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.280
what's the hrv it's like your heart

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.039
variability rate or whatever

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.960
and they're like i look at in this group

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.440
and it says frankie barely last place

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.160
and there's they're at 16 uh and i'm at

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.720
three and they're they're they're

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.720
they're they're they're they're they're

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.720
they're they're they're they're they're

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.160
they're they're they're yours

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.919
they messaged me and they said are you

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.680
having a heart attack right now

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.800
are you dying you should be dead these

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.600
things measure

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.000
all your activity and the chart goes up

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.240
to like 22 or something

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.080
yeah and frankie never gets above a

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.280
three it's like

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.080
literally impossible i woke up with like

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.440
a two and a half they don't start to

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.160
wake up around

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.240
you reporting they don't start the

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.360
number like

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.960
they start the chart at four and i'm

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.400
always below the chart because

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.800
it's just a blue dot it's supposed to be

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.360
bars

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.720
i get like you're making me feel good

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.080
about that i get weekly check-ins from

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.120
people that i'm in this group with

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.520
they're like are you breathing right now

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.639
now you're in a roller hockey league and

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.160
i bet it goes up on your lower you were

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.199
in a roll rock

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.440
yeah it's absurd yeah so i've never

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.280
played organized hockey before and now

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.319
i'm doing it do you even like knowing

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.280
the rules well i i die hard

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.960
like watch every single game so i'm

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.400
playing in this roller hockey league as

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.759
if

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.520
i like know what i'm doing i'm doing

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.280
stereotypical hockey things in this

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.720
league and it's actually been very funny

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.919
do you like you're the only person in

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.039
the world hockey league who's had sex

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.720
before

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.600
are you i mean the only other person the

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.639
only other person in the world i know

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.600
who did this with nate

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.039
i think roller hockey on long island's

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.960
like really big compared to ice

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.880
it's like a badass cool thing to do yeah

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.000
we all you know

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.759
[ __ ] chicks yeah between the period

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.120
there's groupies waiting outside the

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.400
ring like you guys are done yeah i was

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.800
late to this

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.120
like yeah yeah that makes sense to get

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.840
their hands off of me

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.120
you not want to talk about the roller

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.319
hockey anymore because we're making fun

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:45.919
of it

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:47.120
i'm trying to think of my team and i

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.360
don't think anyone's had sex

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.880
he's telling one guy what's your team

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.950
name the outcast

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.280
[Laughter]

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.479
what what's the thing is through the

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.319
etymology of that look at the wheels are

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.000
spinning like how do i spin this how can

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.440
i make this sound better than it is

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.639
because when we talk about it on our

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.000
podcast and he talks about the line it's

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.520
like he's like this is the coolest thing

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.080
ever

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.599

team yeah they all drive like ford rams

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.840
all right well that rules i was gonna

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.880
say that's not something i don't know

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.400
but it's like the it's like the

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.280
little dick syndrome i feel like yeah

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.000
are they watching

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.280

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.920
barstool days we're blogging about her

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.600
and she killed her husband i think or

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.040
she killed someone

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.680
and then as she was found guilty and was

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.480
getting pulled out

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.560
pulled into jail she was like just give

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.959
me the [ __ ] death penalty

00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:29.839
but she only got like 10 years

00:11:40.959 --> 00:11:43.519
he was like i'm just out now they filed

charges and he was like i'm out

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.760
he didn't want to go through the trial

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.200
yeah no yeah he didn't want to sit there

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.240
like you got to say like he didn't want

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.360
to send that trial be like i wonder what

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.760
the verdict's going to do

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.120

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.199
look at the last laughs

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:43.279
like the tiger woods thing i was like

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:44.560
that that was

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.399
i guess bigger than i realized but i i

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:47.920
was saying on kc radio

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.680
kirk minnehan texted me being like are

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.839
you okay my ex-wife texted me are you

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:54.079
okay i got a call from my best friend

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:57.199
i i uh so when tiger first got

00:15:57.199 --> 00:15:59.120
like when that the news broke by tiger's

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.880
accident yeah there was like

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.199
one tweet that was out that said tiger

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:04.800
woods in a car accident and has broken

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.920
both his legs

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.360
which we've been doing this like 10

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.000
years that's a internet hoax like a

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.880
classic

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.240
it's happened to peyton manning cam

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.000
newton russell wilson jay cutler

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.839
and it's always that exact headline so

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:17.279
and so in a car accident broke both

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:17.920
their legs

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.440
so i heard that and i was like this

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.360
isn't real this happens like every three

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.120
years it's a new hoax

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.680
and i was like this [ __ ] is fake idiots

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.480
and then

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.839
like the next second there was a picture

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:29.839
of like a mangled car

00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:31.360
and everybody also i mean the guy broke

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.079
his leg and everyone basically was like

00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:35.040
planning his funeral you know what i

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.560
mean well it's easy to say afterwards

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.399
once we knew he broke his leg

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.000
the initial report was he broke his legs

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.680
yeah no but then there was like we don't

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.759
like they airlifted him to a hospital

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:47.519
jaws of life jaws of life

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:49.440
it makes you think he's clinging to the

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.639
jaws of life it's okay

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:52.320
he's just a fancy professional the door

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.920
opener the door got bent so we had to

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.800
use a machine

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.639
so all that went on and i was like this

00:16:56.639 --> 00:16:58.000
is a hoax and then i was like

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.040
[ __ ] no it's not but i i mean i guess it

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.000
was

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
it just happens to me so often now and i

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.520
really i was i was like

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.319

was saying that tiger came up with the

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.120

we're tiger memorials for the rest of

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.039
time but because he's surviving he'll

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:40.240

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.159
and his boss hold on one second

00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:01.279
start jumping throughout your steering

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:02.080
wheel before you

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.240

chris how are you not in jail man

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:08.480
the guy in oregon this week set a record

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.679
point seven seven

00:24:09.679 --> 00:24:12.480
yeah wow seems impossible that's like

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.039
the highest

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:15.760
highest ever the record of a woman also

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.559
from oregon

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:18.960
really yeah she was like .73 right yeah

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.159
see that's dangerous because that's

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:21.279
where you get like if i was still in

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:22.799
college i'd be like let's go

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:33.840
i'm gonna [ __ ] college

00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:42.159
three more points and all of his blood

00:24:42.159 --> 00:24:43.200
is alcohol

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.960
no no no no one one percent of

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.840
does not mean seventy percent of your

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.440
body that's exactly that's what it meant

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.880
until he said that no i was thinking

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.200
about

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.720
i was thinking batting average almost

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.320
like point three hundreds like you're

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.440
like three hundred that's right

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.440
but what would a batting average of 0.03

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.120
be i know you know what i mean

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.480
no i was just talking about it

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.960
just alcohol running through your

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.679
this is .77 you said

00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:41.200
she blew 0.7 yeah 0.77

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.200
zero seven percent of hurt

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:46.880
all right now i'm starting to come

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.039
around on this you might be right

00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:51.679
no dude i'm correct that's 77 percent of

00:25:51.679 --> 00:25:52.159
one

00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:55.360
why yeah

00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:58.730
[Applause]

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:03.720
[Laughter]

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.000
blood alcohol content levels i think we

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.520
throw out all percentages that we've

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.640
ever known forever

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.880
but on a calculator you times that by a

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.760
hundred points

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.279
yeah yeah all right yes

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:24.320
i knew that all along

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.440
you'd also think that you're not going

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.440
to assume that then 77

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.120
of your blood is alcohol that's right

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.559
yeah that's the number one i mean

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:32.159
we're sending records here i'm like

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:33.919
we're setting records in your body i

00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:34.960
don't even know how that would work

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.440
but that's like what happened to my

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.159
blood

00:26:38.159 --> 00:26:41.360
yeah my blood going yeah

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:53.840
that's 77 i'm still [ __ ] right yeah

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:13.160
[Laughter]

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.760
and i was like well maybe that was your

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.840
other time what's it called the the

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.960
multiverse yeah yeah

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.960
we do this all the time we sit like

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.320
three three doors down from each other

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.120
three chairs down

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.559
and we'll just have these conversations

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:52.159
where it ruins our day where like we

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:53.279
walk away being like well

00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:54.960
i'm just gonna kill myself like what's

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.159
everything we do means nothing i just

00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:57.760
watched a new adam curtis doc

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.480
dude i'm all in on this type of talk

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:00.880
what

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.559
what what is it there's some british guy

00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:05.919
that makes you sad yeah

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:09.360
what's up adam curtis he's like what's

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.360
up cool documentary what's your theory

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.960
internet people what is he saying i

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.840
don't know that's the other thing you

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.320
can't you'll never figure it out

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.520
you just sit there and watch it you're

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.840
like all right i got it just

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.440
as long as you can regurgitate like one

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.760
or two like yeah it's all the algorithm

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.520
that's all you need to know yeah it's

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.760
bad and it's making us

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.080
bad

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.159
you don't believe in it or you just

00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:35.520
don't understand it's easy i just don't

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.480
believe in it i'm not

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.080
the big bang theory doesn't even i don't

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.200
even believe it i think they're actually

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.399
coming around on that that's not

00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:42.559
correct i mean it just seems unlikely

00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:45.840
i'm a creationist

00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:50.000
i think the concept of god is more

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.679
believable than the big bang

00:28:51.679 --> 00:28:54.000
like a speck of dust exploding into

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.679
everything that's ever happened

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:58.240
no way yeah no way but then we also get

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.120
into like

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.880
what was the spec what was it how did

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.559
that go into

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:04.559
that actually it just seems like what

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:06.159
percent of you guys blood is alcohol

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:07.919
right now

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:10.880
what are we doing i watched that cosmos

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.240
with that neil degrasse tyson

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.559
i hate that guy and he's so smug about

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:15.840
it you want to be like he's an [ __ ]

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.039
you don't know what you're talking about

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:18.320
but then he makes [ __ ] points

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.159
you're like well oh i mean he definitely

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:21.039
knows what he's talking about bro he's

00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:21.440
super

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.679
like but he's so [ __ ] like he's so

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:25.120
[ __ ] [ __ ] god doesn't know a

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.880
goddamn thing

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.960
to come through the tv i'm sitting in my

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.240
room putting on my elbow pads ready for

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.720
the roller blade

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:38.240
station it's just like

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.760
it's the level of confidence where he's

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.760
like this is they zoom out at one point

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.120
in casuals and they show

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.919
a river of bubbles and universes within

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:47.279
the river i'm like well now how can you

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:48.320
sit here and say that that's

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.159
kind of actually transfer over to a

00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:51.520
transfer i feel like he's done

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.039
he's probably done more work than you

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:55.440
have though at some point it's a guess

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.120
they can't see further than whatever

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.720
star it is it's a guess it's a

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.279
it's it's an educated guess yeah from

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:02.720
any here's what you need to know any

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.399

being like starting to break tall

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.040

eight feet tall you live for like 28

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.559

he's like

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.680
when you have entire apps that just weed

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.480
you out

just will not even come

00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:35.680
up the algorithm is programmed to just

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.880
push you down

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.599
and it's the number one factor yeah it's

00:53:39.599 --> 00:53:41.520
like the number one how can i define

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.359
this person it's instantly how tall they

00:53:43.359 --> 00:53:43.920
are

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.520
it's unbelievable do you remember

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.119
remember like some of the smokes that we

00:53:47.119 --> 00:53:48.480
were like dealing with or they they were

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.040
like six fours my type like six fours

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.760
like six four but they were like hot

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.640
enough where it's like yeah

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.520
you gotta at least point guard maybe

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.559
power forward

00:53:58.559 --> 00:54:00.319
all right i'm [ __ ] let's do that yeah

00:54:00.319 --> 00:54:01.839
so if you're like five foot it's like

00:54:01.839 --> 00:54:03.359
yeah i just spit on my face girls you

00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:04.720
just hate me dude here's another uh

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.559
would you rather

00:54:06.559 --> 00:54:07.920
someone asked me in the day would you

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:10.160
rather die in 300 degree weather

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.359
uh water 70 degree water or

00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:16.079
like negative 30 degrees 70 degrees

00:54:16.079 --> 00:54:17.200
negative 30. it takes

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:20.240
you're just drowning yes but like three

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:25.839
probably better than yeah

00:54:36.079 --> 00:54:38.559
yeah i guess so yeah the like 70 might

00:54:38.559 --> 00:54:39.280
be out

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.880
the first thing first could you just go

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.480
underneath no way boiling's out

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.000
first dude like that's what i mean i

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.839
think 70 degrees is comfortable and you

00:54:45.839 --> 00:54:47.359
just go underwater and you die

00:54:47.359 --> 00:54:49.440
no maybe the least drowning like 70

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.480
you're like treading well that's the

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.839
most horrific

00:55:08.319 --> 00:55:09.839
i wonder how long could you survive in

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:11.119
70 like how long could you drive water

00:55:11.119 --> 00:55:13.119
before you die

00:55:13.119 --> 00:55:16.240
steve steve jackson no i don't

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.680
i think he said he could do like he said

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.440
he could do 15 i think he's like three

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.400
oh yeah

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.280
and he taps out he's gonna die you could

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.119
walk

00:55:25.119 --> 00:55:26.480
but you're treading water what's the

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.720
point you're like

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.960
i mean if i knew i was gonna die if it's

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:34.079
salt water it's a little easier yeah

00:55:34.079 --> 00:55:35.440
