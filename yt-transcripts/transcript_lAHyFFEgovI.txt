a lot of people give dog walker [ __ ] but

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.280
there's like a crocodile hunter aspect

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.799
to it where you walk into a house with a

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.159
dog you don't know

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.280
and you have to just be ready for

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.280
anything so you think pit bulls are good

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.200
yes it just is about who's raising them

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.400
yeah definitely

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.720
who's raising purples

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.319
what do you mean what do you mean

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.440
they're all over the world whoever

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.799
whoever raises people where do you see

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.640
the most people do you think

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.400
a lot in england

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.519
a lot of people

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.360
where do you see pit bulls dude

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.640
literally i don't i have a pit bull

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.319
everyone has them huh

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.760
farms a lot of times they're an english

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.120
breed really yeah my cousin has people

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.560
feel like they're not in farms a lot

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.599
where where do you get where do you

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.959
think they are

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.400
i'm missing it in mechanicsburg i didn't

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.000
see a lot of pit bulls really and then

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.599
in west philly they seem to be prevalent

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.239
so what do you think who's raising pit

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.920
bulls is what i'm getting at we were

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.479
saying why do i have a bad name

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.239
like because usually when you talk to

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.759
people who love pitbulls particularly

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.000
white people and white women who love

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.880
pits

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.120
they're nice they're really nice dogs

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.800
they're always like it's a really nice

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.560
breed it's just about who's raising them

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.680
and then if you're like wait who's

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.720
raising them

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.840
they do what you just did but they're

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.770
like i don't know

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.800
[Laughter]

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.160
i know what trap you're trying to get of

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.680
course i'm trying to be like oh you mean

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.600
black people with pit bulls yeah i mean

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.960
if you raise people bad it's going to be

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.919
mean

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:44.720
yeah

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.160
so it's just you're saying i should be

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.440
like black people shouldn't have pit

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.440
bulls no it's just funny any time

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.880
somebody like wow

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.560
yeah yeah and you're like it's a good

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.160
breed but it's just who's raising them

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.440
yeah and it's like well wait who's

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.479
raising them yeah no one's gonna be like

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.199
well black people dude

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.880
even like it's funny to try to like

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.400
dance around that be like what do you

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.800
mean i mean uh

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.360
where do you see him i see him on farms

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.440

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.270

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.560
[Laughter]

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.880
but yeah dude they're uh that is a funny

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.400
piece of it dude like the rough riders

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.880

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.479
glamorous i didn't have collies in that

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.240
well they look sick they are they're

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.199
they are definitely like the dog

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.400
equivalent fighting dogs they're like

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.720
the dog equivalent of like a sick chain

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.240
yeah if you just have like a [ __ ] two

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.000
huge pit bulls it looks [ __ ] nice

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.560
with a [ __ ] chain leash yeah oh yeah

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.240
there's a spike leash yeah i just tell

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.600
you how that translates to you being

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.520
some sort of like [ __ ] sick yeah it's

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.520
like white guys get hummers

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.600
yeah to be like i'm the [ __ ] man yeah

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.120
it's like the black guy's hummer it's

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.960
too [ __ ] big

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.000

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.479
i'm the man

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.600
there's also i i think there's a uh

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.160
it's weird i think it's a lot of

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.440
it happens a lot with poor people

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.840
because like my parents

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.840
with dogs no serious dude they're poor

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.240
if you're poor you're behind so like my

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.919
parents grew up with like you keep a dog

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.600
in a backyard and you just that's your

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.520
dog and you don't let it inside

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.800
that's like that's how you do it a lot

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.800
of poor people do that too to where like

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.000
so if you're growing up poor you have a

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.520
dog you're watching someone raise a dog

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.960
you're like dude what the [ __ ] are you

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.479
doing bro

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.360
i'm i'm so if you're poor you don't

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.680
treat dogs nicely a lot of times yeah

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.319
okay a lot of times and that's who's

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.199
poor

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.880
a lot of black people are poor bro

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.479
[ __ ] it's just a fact what are you

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.039
doing it's true it's true checking the

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.120
stats

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.880
i might i'm not going to walk into this

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.720
and i'm going to let you know dude the

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.600
fact that you're going to let me know

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.520
the facts yeah that

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.840
if you're poor so when poor black people

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.600
raise them that's what they're bad most

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.880
times yeah

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.400
that does happen dude

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.160
i mean think i got my opinion yeah all

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.880
right

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.880
like i'm not saying that matt mccusker i

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.479
mean

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.639
i think i don't know i would never blame

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.400
poor black people for pit bulls being

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.479
aggressive dogs i'm not blaming them you

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:04.400
just said that no i'm not yo

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.560
i'm just trying to be fair

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.919
and it's accessible

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:09.759
i'm trying to be damn fair in this

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.759
those are the facts but i mean dude it's

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.759
like my dog came from olney was just

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:15.759
buzzing around my boy's dog came from

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:18.000
nolan he had like chipped up teeth from

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.280
dog fighting yeah who does dog fighting

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.039
it was that was an old i i dude i'm

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:24.560
telling you i i don't i have to read

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.360
this book but thomas soul has a theory

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.199
in his book called

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.440
black rednecks white liberals where they

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.440
think like popular black culture was

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.520
just taken from like white cracker

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.560
culture

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.919
because i wouldn't be surprised to find

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:39.199
out there was a lot of dog fighting in

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.919
the south among white people no i mean

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:42.960
white people

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.800
always like they did bear baiting

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.800
exactly what that is yeah so you just

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.280
tie up a bear and let dogs rip it apart

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.960
i think i didn't know what that was i

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.240
tie up a bear

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.000
and it fights dogs

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.199
that was sick hell i was like yeah i

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:56.840
know what that is yeah you know what it

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.080
is don't know

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.240
and then uh i think they use pimples for

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.120
that yeah so i i'm wildly surmising but

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.120
i wouldn't be surprised i mean if it's

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.120
evil it's it's white people's fault no

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.560
doubt that's all you need to know about

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.960
history 911

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.840
well look at that look at 9 11. it was

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.440
clearly not white people who did that

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.120
you don't think so every single person's

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.560
like yeah i bet white people were behind

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.520
this

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.360
i think i'm full-blown i'm like

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.319
literally

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:24.000
half and half

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.720
gb versus taliban

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.800
george bush yeah what about he could

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.160
have done it dude

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.440
no he couldn't he could have placed

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.279
explosives in there no he couldn't have

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.560
what was he doing when they told him the

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.080
news he was reading a sick book about

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.080
that if i just blew up two buildings in

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.039
new york

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.320
where would you find me i'd be doing

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.760
some weird volunteer for like little

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.440
kids reading a book like what happened

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.560
that's crazy

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.959
i didn't know that i mean you can't

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.320
you can't just be like he had the

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.160
perfect alibi therefore he must be

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.519
guilty

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:52.959
well if you look at all the stuff dude

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:54.959
about the steel beams melting dude i i

00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:56.560
don't know that he did it i don't rule

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.200
it out though that's my thing sure i'm

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.720
alright with that exactly you're allowed

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.320
to like the 911 conspiracy stuff is like

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.200
i'm i'm pretty firmly anti-truther it's

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.120
entertainable if there's stuff in there

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.240
that's like

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.240
i mean there's you you can you can keep

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.839
an open mind to like they've done false

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:15.440
flags before [ __ ] up they've done

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.800
false flags before yeah but not like

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.760
that

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.000
they just faked like the golf attack

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.680
people were shooting don't that's not a

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.440
false they knew that was coming and they

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.760
were like let them go maybe they did

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.480
there's some speculation on that too

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.560
dude that is wild always i really do

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.240
like i don't believe fully in them but

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.920
to think of the dudes who walk around

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.399
all day being like i know he [ __ ] did

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:37.440
it dude

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.519
it's a [ __ ] wild world jadakiss

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.440
believes it yeah definitely why did bush

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.680
knock down the towers yeah [ __ ] yeah

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.040
dude

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.399
um

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:48.080
yeah so you were saying black people

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.880
can't even say that

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.720
i'm just saying that if you're poor and

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.959
you own dogs you're not out here taking

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:56.399

they're not wearing a sweater exactly

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.360
they're not wearing [ __ ] booties dude

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.160
yeah they're kept outside yeah my uh

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
whenever you travel dogs like other

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.839
countries in spain when i was there they

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:08.160

everybody keeps dogs in africa dogs are

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.279
like just more of a nuisance they just

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:12.640

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.399
and it's like they're if you like show a

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:16.079
dog respect there it'd be like someone

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:17.440
was like hugging a deer and petting it

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.399

have to run home because it'd be like

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.480
bags of dogs i would [ __ ] love that

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.600

drowning dogs yeah he was he i think he

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.320
was electrocuting dogs

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.160
it was weird did he play after that at

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.680
all yeah he came to the eagles he was

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.959
pretty afraid he got out of jail he was

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:50.800
pretty [ __ ] good i loved watching him

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.800
play yeah uh there was just a football

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.880
life on him and

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.040
so it's like a kind of like a mini

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.800
half hour documentary on like his career

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.240
and like interviewing him and coaches

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.279
and [ __ ] and then they just had this

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:02.880
lady from like

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.279
the spca or whatever the aspc how do you

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:07.360
say that the double spca yeah and she's

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.800
like uh mike vick is a sociopath he's

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.639
actually a psycho

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:14.560
yeah that would come back to coaches

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.320
think about think about if you grew up

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.720
and you saw dog fighting before you like

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.800
sure made your morals all set up yeah

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.320
yeah yeah that would look [ __ ]

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.240
awesome you would see it and be like

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.880
holy [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.560
true i mean i'm just saying if you're if

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.120
you're like five and you're just like

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.880
whoa this is [ __ ] sick and then

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.639
someone's guess what you can make a lot

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:36.320
of money doing this too yeah and then

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.360
he's a quarterback so he doesn't need

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.240
the money but he's like you know what

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.079
was [ __ ] fun yeah i do understand

00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:42.160
that aspect but but that's that's a

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.639
weird uh racist way to look at it no

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:46.320
it's not yeah it is dude i mean it's

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.079
just black culture no when i was little

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:49.680
i used to [ __ ] like cut frog's head

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.000
off and put like [ __ ] dogs dude i

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.839
know i'm saying i know if you cut a

00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:55.519
[ __ ] cat's head off my thing is i

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:56.959
should take fish and like leave it we

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:58.639
used to put fireworks like with an m80

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:00.160
in a cat's gill and like blow its head

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.399
up and it's like yeah [ __ ] catfish

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:04.399
exactly they sting you they suck

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:06.800
but that's what i was doing so i always

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.320
loved dogs when i was little so i

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.920
wouldn't have done that but but if you

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.600
grew up in i'm not gonna donate virginia

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.440
beach

i mean it's horrible it's so shitty to

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:17.279
do yeah i'm just trying to imagine like

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:18.639
because when you're like to have the

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:20.480
mentality of like all right these dogs

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.880
are going to fight you lost just drown

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.160

dude how the [ __ ] are you doing hang it

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:28.399
hang it from a tree see that's

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:31.199
unnecessary yeah but they also so anyway

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:32.720

service and it's about

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.160
a true story about these dudes who came

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.480

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.639

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:54.880
up before farmers

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.240

that a lot lately of like the difference

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.320
between

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.519
you know

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:42.560
racial humor or just being like

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.639
i [ __ ] hate black people

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:46.079
just like really harbor that you know

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:47.440
what i mean people who walk around all

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.680
day harboring that just being like like

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.199
those guys on fox like there were so

00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:53.199
many people when obama won who were just

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:55.279
like [ __ ] him

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:57.120
[ __ ] him i mean to think about like to

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.480
be unaware of that and be able to be

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.000
like no no no his things are [ __ ]

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.839
he's a muslim oh well they're like i

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:03.120
have no problem with him being black

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.720
he's a [ __ ] muslim he's this he's

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.440
that

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.120
that's a wild that's a wild thing to

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.120
have on that's a wild thought helmet to

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.040
have on what these just to just

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.880
subconsciously you just [ __ ] hate

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.000
blatantly racists yeah i think the i

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.600
think what is we

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.600
i i do think those people exist but i

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.040
don't think there's that many i think

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.320
there's a good amount i mean yeah

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.160
there's a lot but i'm saying i think the

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.000
way you run into racism is usually the

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.600
in-between

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.680
where it's like you're not

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.120
you're not subcu like you're not

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.880
constantly like [ __ ] hate black

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.560
people no that's true but if it comes

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.480
down to it like i knew i used to work

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.560
with guys who like

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.880
so we'd be working somewhere in philly

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.639
no we listen i just worked with guys we

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.639
were working somewhere in philly and

00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:46.320
it was like all they had to do was drive

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.399
down walnut street to have her town so

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.360
you can cut right through up the door

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.279
but it takes [ __ ] 15 minutes yeah and

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:52.480
this guy was like no i'm going to take

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.920

stand looking at him bro

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.720
i think what do you mean he's like i

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.839
just i don't want to drive through that

00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:02.959
black neighborhood i got to take the

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:04.720
highway i'd be like what though is that

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.000
where you got all your pitbull ideas

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.919
from no i'm telling you dude i don't

00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:10.160

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.600
that's what i that's how i can speak on

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.799
anything dude because i don't have hate

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.160
in my heart true

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160
no i mean so i'm undeterred dude by your

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.000
[ __ ] your attempts to bring me down

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.760
be deterred a little i'm not the church

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.679
all right good the um but no that this

00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:23.679
guy literally get off this topic i was

00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:25.600
funny every time i try to write comedy

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.640
yeah i end up just yeah writing racial

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.240
like it's all about that that's all it's

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.760
just subconscious [ __ ] instinct it's

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.200
not my subconscious thing it's just it's

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.360
con that's like the world we're in

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.039
it's like where every single thing is

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:38.240
about that

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.480
and it's [ __ ] ridiculous i don't know

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.559
i mean i guess i don't it it depends

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:44.880
because but also sexism and homophobia

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.400
and [ __ ] like that where it's just like

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.320
yeah it's definitely our world i'm not

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.160
talking about our country or whatever

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.840
but it's like living here and being

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.760
around open mic comics

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.760

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.320
like he had to try so hard to cry

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.039

what's the instinct when especially when

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.280

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.440

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.360

seemingly unrapable

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.320

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:19.440
almost unrapeable

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.000
but she's done it absolutely brilliant

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.840
thank you kesha

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.240
about being a [ __ ] you've been raped

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.480
yeah brilliant

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.080
you're slut-shaming dude yeah well i was

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.440
being a horrible [ __ ] yeah you're being

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.880
a dick i was intentionally being you

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.559
know yeah in the name of comedy in the

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:40.480
name of beautiful art yeah but uh her

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.559
dad yeah like while kesha was crying i

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:44.240
was like absolutely brilliant you've

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.960
dressed like a matador and claimed rape

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.440
on a national stage

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.840
undeniable

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.280
but um

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.320
kyla was up there and she was like

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.720
you you gotta stop like

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.320
she was like well did you see the thing

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.240
with the guy from michigan state today

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.600
yeah it's like maybe these girls aren't

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.520
all lying i was like

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.039
wait yeah i'm not saying cause you're

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:08.480
alive first off

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.000
if you think the narrative in this

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.400
country is that all women are lying

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.000
versus what the narrative actually is

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.960
which is women are never lying yeah

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.039
that's just ridiculously twisted that's

00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:21.360
the thing about it too to where like i

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.559
mean dude

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:24.559
a year ago

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:26.799
a year ago it takes about 10 seconds for

00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:30.240
me to think about what i just said

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.400
[Laughter]

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.880
a year ago though it was like

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.640
there was people coming out being like i

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.919
always believe a woman and then that

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:40.960
kind of was like well you can't do that

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.799
guess why the justice system and then

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:44.320
the conversation's so uncomfortable that

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.080
it just fades into the background yeah

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.280
so then when all this stuff comes out

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.559
now like dude

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:50.960
who the [ __ ] just came down i think the

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.559
the who's the guy the casino mogul just

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:53.679
got in trouble

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:55.679
for sexual assault allegations and he's

00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:57.760
sick if he was a native he lost like 350

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.440
no he's not a native he was a native

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.120
casino no he would they wouldn't give a

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.240
[ __ ] he lost like 357 million dollars

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.080
and since he was a

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.039
donor

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:08.240
i think he used to like donate money to

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.760
the rnc they're like well give back the

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.400
money he gave you in the rnc is like no

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.280
yeah that's what they're doing with

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.760
weinstein in the dnc yeah and they were

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.440
like no

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.320
no

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.120
everyone was like nah they're like uh

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.360
we'll give back a little bit well we're

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.919
gonna donate some to women yeah this is

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:27.679
clinton foundation it goes right back

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:30.240
into the machine absolute but dude it's

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.840
it's like they're

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.919
it's hitting a point now where it's like

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:35.520
you can't tell me now that it's like if

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.880
you want to dismantle if you're

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.120
democrats and it's like

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.799
those the politicians aren't being like

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.720
well is it right to kind of allege stuff

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.840
i'm not saying they're doing it i don't

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.679
know but it's definitely usable to be

00:22:45.679 --> 00:22:46.799
like

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.240
like the point where they got their guy

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.919
they're like one of the rnc's big

00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:51.600
funders and it's like well they give

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.960
that money back because they're it's

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.480
like strategically trying to take money

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.559
out of the republican party dude this is

00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:58.320
[ __ ] crazy

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.919
yeah i mean that's where like the roy

00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:01.039
moore thing

00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:02.080
yeah

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.159
it's like i think he was pretty guilty

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:06.320
but also it was an interesting timing on

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.240
when all those allegations came out yeah

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.559
as soon as it was re-election time yeah

00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:12.640
and he like i said it's like that's odd

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.080
he didn't help himself because i was

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.840
watching like a weirdo come on bro and

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.039
then when he did that one where it's

00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:19.200
like you had sex with a 17 year old and

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.840
you're 30 he was like i don't think so i

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.440
was like come on man it's like the

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.440
[ __ ] uh sandusky thing it was like

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.880
are you attracted

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.080
to boys

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.480
he's like what do you mean by attracting

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.720
all right

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.840
yeah i uh now i want to do a soccer

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.600
voice about kesha

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.840
what in my head that's dude that is all

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.840
over my head right now that is absolute

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.520
brilliance well that and it's the

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.240
unrapable it is weird

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.960
it is weird though to be like

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.880
uh i can't think of how to say it but

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.799
it's like a

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:54.880
commoditized like it's like a commodity

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.760
now of like oppression fighting

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.120
oppression it's like something you can

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.159
sell now

00:24:00.159 --> 00:24:02.640
yeah yeah it's fully fully there's like

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.720
no denying it they're selling time's up

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.120
pins yeah exactly someone's making

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.559
[ __ ] bank

00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:10.720
six said he ordered you and me times two

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.279
times good i'm definitely wearing that i

00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:14.720
don't wear it it's just

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.080
when you watch something that's that's

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.679
the split of it for me it's like well

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:20.240
that was my big season sorry beef it's

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.400
like there's women who get raped and

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.640
it's absolutely horrific they get raped

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.840
you know

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.360
whatever happens it's horrible and then

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.320
it's like

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.440
and then you get that girl against

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.039
disease and sorry who was like i was on

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:33.279
a date and

00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:34.720
i sucked a guy's dick and i didn't

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.120
really want to but i did it anyway

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.400
because i thought i'd have a famous

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.760
boyfriend and everyone would be jealous

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.120
of me and then it didn't pan out the way

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.880
i wanted it and i'm just going to say

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.799
that i was uncomfortable and kind of

00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:46.400
assinuate that he sexually assaulted me

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.679
and that's yeah yeah when people if

00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:48.880
you're like that's [ __ ] people like

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.320
well [ __ ] you you didn't need anything

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.240
and it's like you're just watering down

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.760
a rape dialogue to where people who got

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.080
raped are like no that you're not that's

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.840
not the same thing you can't do that no

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.960
of course not and that's i don't know

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.480
what kesha's thing was like did she get

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.880
date raped i have no idea

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.000
i don't know

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.600
i have no idea about kesha that's what

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.880
i'm saying i don't know either but i do

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.039
know she's saying a pretty powerful song

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:11.760
she did that's all that matters now

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.679
that you put on a sick performance of

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:16.240
the grammys

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.360
i mean

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.200
it's tough to say because who knows what

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.720
happened that's the thing

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.400
union tonight it's gonna be [ __ ] lit

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.000
dude people are sick of winning politics

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.760
are hot right now politics are real hot

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.679
some guy there was a dude in california

00:27:35.679 --> 00:27:38.640
recently who outlawed giving plastic

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.000
straws out it's [ __ ] unless requested

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.520
so he outlawed it and if you get if so

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.880
if you if i if you had a burger place

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.559
and i walked in and ordered and then you

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:48.000
just gave me a plastic straw without me

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.240
asking in the bill it was a misdemeanor

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.679
so you could face a thousand dollar fine

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:53.440
and up to six months in prison

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.279
so this dude came out and fought against

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:56.799
it this republican guy and was basically

00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:58.240
saying like it's ridiculous blah blah

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.919
and at the end he was like this is the

00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:02.720
last straw

00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:08.480
like the guy who brought snow into the

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.640
senate did you do you remember that yeah

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.159
he's arguing against [ __ ] global

00:28:12.159 --> 00:28:15.440
warming he brought a snowball in

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.799
who in congress

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:21.919

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:25.520
yeah i mean dude that goes back to my

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.520

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.600
those things of like

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.440

[ __ ] years dude yeah of course that's

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.159

00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:39.520
mad and be like

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.000
they started [ __ ] what happened to

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.279
sumpter or sumner someone fought him

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:47.279
before the civil war broke out i might

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:48.960
join politics and just become like an

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.360

right so in this war it started with a

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.039
battle at fort sumpter okay so this

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:02.960

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.880

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.720

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.640
and you're afraid to admit you did

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.480

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.680
strategically but like having a black

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.440

i was i was grabbing on my bae i just

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.000
said a bunch of like misogynistic [ __ ]

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.440
on stage you got off in a squeeze to her

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.480
ass and was like what's up baby

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.160
yeah that's uh

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.000
i was making fun of uh that video i

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.240
showed you before we came down here that

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.200
of that open mic comic

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.079
oh the one where oh my god dude how

00:40:08.079 --> 00:40:10.079
funny is it [ __ ] out of here we're not

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:12.800
gonna obviously name anybody no but uh

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.160
this this

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.760
female comic we'll do a what would you

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.680
do scenario this is really great this

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.000
female comic films herself and she's

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.880
laying on her bed and filming

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.480
above her

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.560
head like so it's a downward angle

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.160
looking so she's looking up at the

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.320
camera laying on her bed it's the angle

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.400
if you go on online dating all girls do

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.680
or they hold a camera over their head

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.200
and it's just straight cleavage yeah

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.760
it's just her tiss

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.800
literally probably get in trouble for

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.040
saying that uh but you did that's

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.720
literally what the it's like it's an

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.119
angle that whether you know it or not

00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:47.599
for your face to look skinny and for

00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:49.599
your tits to look great that's literally

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:51.440
that's what she's doing in this video

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.440
and then she sings us she plays a song

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.560
like that

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.079
so i mean if you're gonna play a song

00:40:56.079 --> 00:40:57.119
obviously that's not how you're gonna

00:40:57.119 --> 00:40:58.800
sit to [ __ ]

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.640
if if the focus of that video was how

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.480
good the song would sound you wouldn't

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.160
[ __ ] play it laying on your back well

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.400
if you're like a roman like uh

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.920
if you're like in a harem and you're

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.079
like paid and you're like

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:12.560
perhaps that's the only way but

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.119
she put up music video singing a funny

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:16.079
song

00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:18.960
and uh then the first comment is this

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.720
guy who wasn't a comic that just knows

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.920
her and he's like

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.200
love that angle dot dot dot smiley face

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.040
just a normal [ __ ] dude had no idea

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.280
the trap he just entered i know that's

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.079
what's funny is like 50 comments of like

00:41:32.079 --> 00:41:34.240
open mic comics being like don't be

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.400
[ __ ] sexist you [ __ ] [ __ ] like

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.160
all this it's funny to think of dudes

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.760
who live outside that bubble and they

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.520
just kind of like poke into this weird

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.640
realm and they're just like what the

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.319
[ __ ] is going on

00:41:44.319 --> 00:41:45.680
like hey nice tits i mean everyone's

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.160
like [ __ ] you get the [ __ ]

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.880
dude to be fair to him it's like

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.200
it was a trap it's just it's

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.960
whether it was conscious or not it was a

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.200
tit trap i'd think it was but i can't

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.560
you know whether it was conscious or not

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.400
it was designed if you were a man and

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.599
you're seeing someone laying there it

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:03.440
was designed in a way that you would go

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.599
she looks nice just tits like you you

00:42:05.599 --> 00:42:07.520
just see tits and it's

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.440
just the [ __ ] reality situation if

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.520
somebody posts a video

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.520
pretty much showing their tits

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.800
not showing their tits but you know what

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.800
i mean like that's the boosting them

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.400
boost them give them a good look yeah

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.760
that's the angle you went for it was

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:22.160
like if i [ __ ] took a so if i did a

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.079
video in like tight sweatpants and i had

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:26.160
like a nice little semi going and i was

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.079
like laying like face down on the bed

00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:29.760
dick bulge in the camera and then played

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.599
the harmonica exactly dude people

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:33.359
wouldn't be like nice harmonica yeah

00:42:33.359 --> 00:42:35.040
yeah dude why'd you put your boner

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.839
online exactly so that's the and that's

00:42:37.839 --> 00:42:39.520
the thing and it just sucks because like

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.520
even people who are like like i'd love

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.440
to give people truth serum who are like

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.640
why don't you [ __ ] leave her alone

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.000
it's like dude you watch that video like

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.440
damn look at her tits

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.520
you definitely did dude get the [ __ ] out

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.319
of here

00:42:50.319 --> 00:42:52.240
there's no way you just you there's no

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.680
way you watch that and did it for a

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.839
split second go like whoa nice angle and

00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:58.800
then like exactly what that guy said

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.359
but i mean it's just funny that like he

00:43:01.359 --> 00:43:02.720
said that

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.760
thinking that's what she was going for

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.200
you know what i mean like she set up

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.800
that angle

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.040
to do that yeah and then he commented

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.040
like nice angle yeah like i see what you

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.440
did there thanks that was nice yeah he's

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.839
like cool yeah good angle

00:43:17.839 --> 00:43:19.200
that you chose

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.880
yeah intentionally

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.480
yeah and then everyone's like [ __ ] you

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.920
dude i mean dude if you if you go on

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.480
youtube they put like thumbnail pics

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.359
over videos exactly set up like that to

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:33.920
get visual attention yeah so it's like

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.920
well anyway i mean how dare i mean the

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.400
thing is though it is funny the thing is

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.760
it's like

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.500
so if you

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.920
[Music]

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.760
just weird because like you can't

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.760
there's such a visual trap huge tits or

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.960
a visual trap if i see them it's all

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.480
camel toes we're not talking about that

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.400

yeah

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.640
like you did the fact that people want

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.000
to deny

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.920
like the visit like the visual aspect to

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.160
male biology is crazy to me now it's

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.839
like how that's what you thought of it's

00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:09.760
like yeah that's exactly what i thought

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.240
about i saw that and i was like

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.240
oh that's a tit angle yeah that's a tit

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.000
angle it's an angle if i had if i had a

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.760
thing a phone dressing that that video

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.839
was taken from that angle was to make it

00:45:19.839 --> 00:45:21.280
a tit angle

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.480
yeah

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.000
most likely

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:24.800
i mean

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.040
you can't be so you can't be just un

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.960
responsibly wheeling titties around like

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.880

lane dude it's like yo give me your

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.720
[ __ ] license yeah if you're just

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.400
tossing tits out and then criticizing

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.400
people that are like hey nice tits even

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.560
you're in the wrong he said nice angle

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.560
dude he wasn't even talking kids

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.160
so how did they know when he said nice

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.599
angle how did they even know he was

00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:47.040
being creepy maybe he just liked the

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.960
film maybe he's a student of film he was

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.440
he was so how did people even assume he

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.440
if if they didn't know

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.280
that they were filming at a tit angle

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.040
how did they know he was referring to

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.520
tits by saying nice angle because

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.880
everybody knew they were referring to

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.440
tits exactly dude every single time it

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.040
was like yeah tits

so how did it like because it was vague

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.560
it was also funny one of the comments

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.240
she wrote was like the views are really

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.680

hot chick on instagram and like it

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.160

know i think i've talked about this

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.480
before but i didn't know other people

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.560

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.480
instagram really so like i was liking

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.920
hot chicks pictures and my girlfriend

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.240

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.720
those [ __ ] pictures i was like no

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.319
it was an accident why did you like it

00:47:58.319 --> 00:47:59.839
that's the thing why did you double tap

00:47:59.839 --> 00:48:02.400
it i did and she was like what the [ __ ]

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.599

appreciate them you got to give them

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.079
some [ __ ] got a set of i know it's

00:48:08.079 --> 00:48:10.720
just it's fun it's funny to think about

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.960
facebook and instagram

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.920
as like this weird ecosystem of just

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.000
like buttons and clicks that are totally

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.520
arbitrary

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.119
to where it's like like when i would go

00:48:21.119 --> 00:48:23.359
on facebook and write a status

00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:25.040
i would check back 10 minutes later if i

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.960
got like high likes i'd be like [ __ ]

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.079
yeah dude and then i got that let me

00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:29.280
swing over to [ __ ] twitter and i'd be

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.200
like oh a retweet all right i'm [ __ ]

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.960
killing it i just posted a tweet before

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.280
we started and it is not flourishing

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.280
dude it makes you feel bad i think it's

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.720
totally unoriginal i think that's the

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.559
problem with it yeah but it's just weird

00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:42.559
to think that like you're taking your

00:48:42.559 --> 00:48:44.960
mood can be ruled by like that little

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.880
icon of a globe lighting up and you oh a

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.559
lot of notifications oh i got a lot of

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:50.720
likes and it's like they don't translate

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.240
really into anything damn that's a

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.359
deletable tweet what is it exactly

00:48:55.359 --> 00:48:56.720
i'm telling you you gotta you gotta get

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.559
off social media the last tweet i just

00:48:58.559 --> 00:48:59.680
said was

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.520
there's an inverse correlation between

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.359
how funny your shirt is and how funny

00:49:03.359 --> 00:49:05.760
you are

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.440
was this in starbucks

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.720
and what was the first draft like

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.160
there's an inverse population there's an

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.760
inverse thing with black no there's

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:12.960
everything

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.079
but no

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:15.920
between pit bulls and black people's

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.440
wealth no that would be a direct

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.480
correlation

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.240
but and then yesterday this did well

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.400
dude this i got 26 likes

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.839
that's good stuff at this point there's

00:49:25.839 --> 00:49:27.920
about an 80 chance my dad's last words

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.440
are dilly dilly

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.839
how good did you feel afterwards uh see

00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:32.640
i don't know though because i don't

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.000
think either of those are very funny i

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.839
just they just seem like the typical

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:37.760
[ __ ] twitter [ __ ] gay [ __ ] that

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.599
people like on twitter yeah

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:40.800
i don't feel strong about either of

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.800
those yeah in fact i'm deleting that but

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.119
you got more you know it added to your

00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:46.559
uh

00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:48.000
it added to like the

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
illusory economy of

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.839
[ __ ] clicks and you don't deserve it

00:49:51.839 --> 00:49:53.680
that was when i last week when i

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.920
retweeted trump's

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.319
uh oh his email march and i said one of

00:49:58.319 --> 00:49:59.680
the greatest counter punchers of our

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.160
time that guy i got one leader seven

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.040
likes

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.040
that's pretty good on twitter it's funny

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.720
to call him a counter puncher likes on

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.280
twitter are like dog ears so it's like

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.400
seven likes what's a 50 like

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.160
because that that fluctuates dog ears

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.480
because golden retrievers oh the white

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.200
dog

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:20.559
the new england patriots of dogs

00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:22.079
i try to think of the lightest dog i can

00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:24.559
think of that is chocolate

00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:26.880
yeah chocolate labs little shitty dogs

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.240
are very white i'm prejudiced against

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.760
when i see white people entering the dog

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.359
park with like a lab like a couple i'm

00:50:31.359 --> 00:50:33.359
like [ __ ] i always in my head i'm

00:50:33.359 --> 00:50:34.880
like yeah

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.559
because whenever it's like my dogs are

00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:38.319
in there [ __ ] scrapping dude so like

00:50:38.319 --> 00:50:40.160
i see them come in and i just go now

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.240
[ __ ] yeah but see when i see white dudes

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.559
with pitbulls i'm a little like

00:50:44.559 --> 00:50:47.359
really why

00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:48.480
so what do you think it's like a

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.599
corvette of dogs no it's not the hacky

00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:53.440
corvette of dogs no you go to a dog

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.800
shelter and like what do you got and

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.960
they're like we have uh pit bulls and we

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.040
have pimples and we have pit bulls yeah

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.200
yeah dog kennels around here would have

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.960
strictly pickles yeah they have a lot

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.800
yeah that makes sense or they have like

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.000
weird they'll get every now and again

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.359
they'll get like the uh that's the other

00:51:07.359 --> 00:51:09.119
thing too a lot of black people have

00:51:09.119 --> 00:51:11.680

white fluffy dogs that go around dude

00:51:17.839 --> 00:51:19.760
it's so funny it's a favorite of the

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.119
black community which is great that'd be

00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:22.800
cool if that was their flag

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.520
it's a teeny little fluffy white donut

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.359

to see a biopic and see how they like

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.000
started and [ __ ] yeah but they're tough

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.040
to glorify his

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.640
these people in the beginning

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.960
that are like wanted fbi most wanted all

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.640
this [ __ ]

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.559
and to an extent they're right because

00:52:36.559 --> 00:52:38.720
the fbi did like

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.000
the one guy i was reading about i think

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.400
it was his stepdad or his

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.559
they were like the fbi

00:52:44.559 --> 00:52:46.960
illegally kind of

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.640
they were trying to get him arrested

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.040
yeah but the guy did rob an armored

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.599
truck and execute two guards

00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:55.839
really they leave that out in the movie

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.200
though so you were you were factual

00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.119
robin banks huh and it's like well you

00:52:59.119 --> 00:53:01.040
also murdered really some murdering

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.319
goals you did some fact checking you

00:53:02.319 --> 00:53:03.520
always got to fact check these they did

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.800
the same thing with angela davis and

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.559
that one uh

00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:08.319
there was one documentary oh the 13th

00:53:08.319 --> 00:53:10.160
amendment yeah about

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.480
the industrial prison complex all that

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.880
[ __ ] which is real but oh when they yeah

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.319
they started doing the kids indentured

00:53:16.319 --> 00:53:18.559
servitude basically like modern slavery

00:53:18.559 --> 00:53:19.839
they would steal they were arresting

00:53:19.839 --> 00:53:22.079
black people they would impose kids but

00:53:22.079 --> 00:53:24.319
it's like uh they had angela davis on

00:53:24.319 --> 00:53:26.319
there and she was talking and i was like

00:53:26.319 --> 00:53:28.559
i wonder what she did to get arrested

00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:31.200
it was like oh she supplied guns to

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.119
guys who shot up a courtroom and killed

00:53:33.119 --> 00:53:34.319
people

00:53:34.319 --> 00:53:36.079
it's like so i mean maybe she's a hero

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:37.920
but she also

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.040
you know

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.640

about it so yeah i know you're that was

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.119
a it's like what's that i think it's

00:53:49.119 --> 00:53:50.559
angela davis i hope i'm not getting that

00:53:50.559 --> 00:53:52.559

he's a politician he lived in london and

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.319
he felt like everyone slighted him so

00:55:14.319 --> 00:55:16.240

and [ __ ] them up so malcolm x like when

00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:23.920
they're like you know like why do they

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.079
[ __ ] want to kill him he was

00:55:26.079 --> 00:55:27.440
they were having meetings like yo this

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:29.760

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.599
and then he came back and was like i'm

00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:33.040
not really with that muslim brotherhood

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.160
[ __ ] and the muslim brotherhood

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.920
apparently killed him which is why i'm

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.280
sure there's tons of conspiracies about

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.680
it angela davis did uh

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:42.079
she was as as a result of purchasing she

00:55:42.079 --> 00:55:44.240
purchased the firearms used in a 1970

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.240
armed takeover of a marin county

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.760
california courtroom in which four

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.920
people were killed

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.079
so

00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:55.040
so she

00:55:55.119 --> 00:55:57.040
she was persecuted for conspiracy she

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.680
was later acquitted of this charge

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:00.960
hmm

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.160
maybe they're trying to pin it on her

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.280
dude

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:06.319
use a commie maybe

00:56:06.319 --> 00:56:08.240
no i really read this before she was

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.720
pretty [ __ ]

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.720
she was guilty of the guns

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.200
yeah i don't know man i she could've it

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.720
is what you're saying though is to be

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.119
like again like the tupac's stepped at

00:56:19.119 --> 00:56:20.720
where it's like like he was just a good

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.559
old bank robber yeah it's like well he

00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:25.440
executed two guys killed people yeah

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.760
yeah whatever they should put that in

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.440
yeah just to add to the completeness of

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.880
the whole thing because what actually

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.880
happened yeah you know yeah exactly yeah

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.799
like the fbi was just bulged barging in

00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:36.799
on a guy trying to feed his family yeah

00:56:36.799 --> 00:56:38.799
he's like no he killed two people yeah

00:56:38.799 --> 00:56:40.240
so

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.920
yeah if your basic goal that's the other

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.040
thing that cracks me up and it's like

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.880
your basic goal is to feed your family

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.920
it's like

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.280
there's a lot of lesser crimes you can

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.440
do you don't gotta [ __ ] rob an

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.960
armored truck you know what i mean yeah

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.160
this is i don't want to get into this

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.240
[ __ ] oh yeah this is hey dude it's your

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.079
instincts dude no it's not my instincts

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.839
turning from the [ __ ] inner more door

00:56:57.839 --> 00:56:59.920
that lays inside you dude

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.200
perhaps

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.799
perhaps i am as god made me dude

00:57:04.799 --> 00:57:06.880
i just i just treat everybody as equals

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.119
that's sick you're working on your um

00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:11.040
your racial sympathies

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.640
what do you mean you're trying to just

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.400
knock off your [ __ ] prejudice

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.400
behavior no i'm not i'm not trying to

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.000
get them all on me it's just funny

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.400
you're definitely placing them all on me

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.559
no i was just i was just exactly what

00:57:22.559 --> 00:57:24.319
you were projecting dude when did i

00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:26.480
project telling me that stuff about like

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:28.079
black people and pit bulls and getting

00:57:28.079 --> 00:57:29.760
me into really bad situations where i

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.599
had a [ __ ] getting you to

00:57:31.599 --> 00:57:34.160
speak what was when i did get that was a

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.280
good move to be like what do you think

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.640
about pitbull it's like yeah it's a good

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.240
breed they're nice but it's just what

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.599
happened it's about the people who raise

00:57:39.599 --> 00:57:41.280
them and it's with any dog too that's

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.640
the thing of course it's why golden

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.280

people who are poor and they tie dogs to

00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.359

they know there's always

01:03:53.839 --> 01:03:55.200
like quoting someone or doing an

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.720
impersonation of a black person that's

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.760
true

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.400
with an a ending

white guy from like kensington yeah it's

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.440
all about how it comes off your tongue

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.480
there's some guys you're saying it's

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.440
like damn you've been saying that

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.640

01:04:35.119 --> 01:04:37.200
pretty good with that to where like if i

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.799
tried to slip that in a casual

01:04:38.799 --> 01:04:40.480
