00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.360
painted actual microphone that looks

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.879

bacon

talking about lewis treats uh lewis

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.959

00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:19.120
1800's aristocrat and he found out that

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.640
they were charging him for every refill

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.680

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:27.519
standing there he's crazy yeah it was

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:29.920
funny she got it she did not get it she

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.000
got it but in lewis's defense that is a

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.680
dick move they'll charge you for every

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.040

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.519
party they knew that i was in charge

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.480

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.680
you sir we're not going to charge you

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.800
for the car you brought us all this

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.920
business yeah that is a 1500 bill

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.519
that was empty there's nobody who's

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:49.200

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.560
afforded us free refurbishments i'll be

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.760
honest you should i i i i'm i'm very uh

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.760
weary of a place that's not uh free

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.680
rifles and sodas yeah it's a little it's

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.279
a little bit but everything's all a card

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:01.120
there there's not there's no free lunch

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.800
there dude no it's everything's

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.120
everything

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:12.320
if you order just a meal in there i'm

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.680
sure everything's all a car no but it's

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.440
essentially a it's

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.760
a brazilian version of buffet they just

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.279
bring the meat to you the fact that

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:20.720
things so i'm saying like

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.720
sort of nail you on [ __ ]

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.399
soda seems like a weird

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:25.600
fancy place you're right you're right

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.800
with a party that big they should have

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.839
been like oh we're not gonna charge them

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:30.320
for refills and sodas it's [ __ ]

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.560
you know whatever they would and me

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.079
personally i end up getting stuck with

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:36.240
150 at the end because

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.079
i'm the one doing the [ __ ] bill i

00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:39.600
don't even know how that works we did

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.120
the math correct

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.800
it's never it's never correct that's

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.680
never

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.720
by the way

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.320
now

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.079
now i'm with dave i would also have made

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:49.839
an excuse just to not be a part of that

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:52.079
weird thing where you're like everyone's

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:54.480
like everyone goes uh

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.640
57 and someone goes i only brought 50

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.720
because you told me it was 50. and then

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.240
someone goes i'll cover his set and then

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.480
it just gets all [ __ ] up and i'm i

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.079
stand there doing this with my hands

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:05.279
because i'm doing

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:07.360
[ __ ] jazz hands

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.959
bossy fingers

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:11.440
you you [ __ ] figure it out i'll be

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.560
over here going fossy fingers

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.560
because you're nervous

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.839
it makes me it makes me uncomfortable

00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:27.200
actually keeps his fingers warm they're

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.959
cold because the gloves

00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:30.720
yeah i get uncomfortable with that i

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.560
feel like well i i personally raise my

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.480
ass i'll do it for everybody because i

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.160
set up the lunch and i know it's weird

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.839
to [ __ ] have everybody figuring it

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:39.360
out but when you do that you're also

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.360
deciding i'm gonna probably pay three

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.959
times as much as i should pay there

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:44.240
should be a thing where the guys who

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.440
ordered drinks because some guys were

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.839
ordering beers and drinks so they should

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:50.079
get a separate check everybody pays 50

00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:51.360
and then if you want to order your own

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.079
drinks yeah like six cups

00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:55.440
that's really what the difference was we

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.760
had like 20 sodas on it and people paid

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.519
for sex see i s

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.839
i would never drink in that situation

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:03.600
either because i'd be worried now i have

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.200
to [ __ ] drink boring ass water

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.800
because these [ __ ] can't figure out no

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.399
the worst thing though is that like i'll

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:10.320
drink in that situation but i'll just

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.320
i'll always account and pay more for the

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.360
drink the worst thing is when someone

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.880
will drink like they'll have like eight

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.160
drinks and then they'll be like all

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.680
right so we're all splitting it up and

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.600
you're just looking at them like so

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.279
you're gonna make me say it like you're

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:22.959
not just gonna be like oh yeah i had

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:26.560
[ __ ] six vodkas so probably i should

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.639
pay a little bit more than you do what

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.800
if you get my drinks and then i offer

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.320
you road dates

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.920
how about that because it is a comic

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.079
lunch i don't know it just doesn't sound

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:37.519
reasonable let's think

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:38.959
kick me a hypothetical where soda has

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:40.160
some road days

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.560
do you remember remember the wayne uh

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.320
and wayne will hear this to the wayne

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.240
and nate argument at that time oh yeah

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.880
yeah this is why they hate each other

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.160
i don't know

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.000
but i just like to stir things up yeah

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.680
this is why nate still says he's going

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.279
to kill wayne rada

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:56.560
hey man

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.800
before the aids does he will not come to

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.720
an outdoor barbecue

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.399
in wayne's apartment with frightening

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:03.380
art it was so

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.200
[Laughter]

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.519
aggressive street art and a barbecue is

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:09.040

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.839
jump the pegs

00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:03.519
to find out if you're a genius they also

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:05.519

throughout finally this time

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.760
she died i i

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.679
they told me she was gone

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:54.559
i had i was at home i've never stayed

00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:56.080
home i stayed with her with the

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.039
motorcycle bobby

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.400
all right well there we go you really do

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.919
uh just throw bobby under the bus but

00:23:05.919 --> 00:23:07.600
you start by going just go to the end

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.640
and then

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.840
where he should have gone is in the

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.159
middle do the motorcycle part

00:23:12.159 --> 00:23:14.480
so so uh

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.559
so the woman says well come come sit

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:18.559
near him and you know so i actually got

00:23:18.559 --> 00:23:20.080
on my knees you know like a catholic

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.080
good catholic and i'm like on my knees

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.240
and she's not relaxed relaxing and he

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.000
looks at me and he couldn't i think

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.120
that's not the right story

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.600
this is the junkie in the monk there's

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.440
nothing new the junkie in the mug i you

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.640
think it would say

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.679
probably the motorcycle ride

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:42.159
one last ride junkie in the monk doesn't

00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:43.600
make any sense

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.200
more than one story

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.559
this [ __ ] did more than one

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:49.279
thing oh come on doggy i love he lived

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:51.679
five lives even when louis like like

00:23:51.679 --> 00:23:53.440
yells at the staff but he's completely

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.279
wrong you can only get so angry at him

00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:57.200
because this entire company and i've

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.279
noticed this the entire company runs off

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:00.799
everyone being afraid louis is going to

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:02.080
yell at that's right

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.679
that's how everything at gas digital

00:24:03.679 --> 00:24:05.360
gets done i looked at before the show

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.120
started bobby thought a chord was

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.880
missing and like freaked out for a

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.400
second and then he was like oh no no we

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.240
got all the chords but like bobby almost

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.679
had a heart attack over a thing that

00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:15.520
wasn't even a problem just because he

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.559
knows lewis will blow

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:27.679
yeah but this is yeah i remember i i i

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:29.440
that's okay pull it up in a second i

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.799
remember this was a moment you guys

00:24:30.799 --> 00:24:32.320
remember ding dong she was old producer

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.520
of the show

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.120
one time after she was working with the

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.720
show for like three weeks it was a

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.320
moment that i it'll always stand out to

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.240
me like in the production of this show

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.840
first time you raped ding dong

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.240
raped her she wouldn't stop wearing that

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.840
bright red shirt she noticed i'm like a

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.240
bull i see red

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.039
um

00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:49.760
no

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.679
she said i remember after like

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:54.320
like she was only like three weeks

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.000
and she was frustrated i was upset about

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.600
something something had gone wrong and

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.799
she was like you just like expect

00:24:58.799 --> 00:25:02.320
everything to be perfect and i went yes

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.960
[ __ ] yes now you get it go make it

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.400
perfect

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.159
and that was that

00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:09.360
you know this is like the type of story

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.720
someone else is supposed to tell about

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.760
you

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.600
nope and they're supposed to say like

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.159
what the [ __ ]

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.080
it's supposed to be attached to

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.760
jesus uh motorcycle what is it called

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.600

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.679
the moth

00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:38.960
when i was a kid i wanted to get a

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.360
harley really bad i killed now we can

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.279
fast forward we'll go halfway then i saw

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:45.760
these guys

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.240
go to the middle of the middle

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.039
that's 25 of the way through

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.480
internet's alone can i say something

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.919
about mike while this is going on maybe

00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:57.279
mike wasn't for your listeners who might

00:25:57.279 --> 00:25:59.039
not know he was a very social worker he

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:00.480
was a very good comic and he was friend

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.919
we were all friends with him so this is

00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:04.240
not coming from a malicious place no i

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.760
actually i love the guy we don't i

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.159
actually uh like when i was seeing him

00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:09.360
fantastic

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.000
it was a little bit weird to me uh just

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.279
when we first started playing the video

00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:14.880
where it's like i haven't like seen yeah

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.360
yeah it struck me [ __ ] i cried my

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.200
eyes out when i found out he died yeah

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.720
he was a great oh yeah you and him were

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.240
like you got him i was very close with

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.159
him yeah yeah yeah but uh no mike was a

00:26:24.159 --> 00:26:26.400
great you guys had the same haircut

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.600
he was like over to me and said mike um

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.400
you know people

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.679
are never dying

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.600
they live

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.200
and then they die

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.480
and dying is in a moment

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.080
and she feels that you're treating her

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.840
as if she's dying and you don't need her

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.320
anymore

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.760
and you don't love her anymore and

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.120
you know that wasn't the truth you know

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.960
and i i didn't know how to tell her it i

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.279
told her every day

00:26:57.279 --> 00:26:59.120
we used to go out for dinners and stuff

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.559
she wanted to go out i would take her

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:01.520
out

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.279
she'd have her oxygen tank with her and

00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:05.279
i'd take her to a restaurant and i'd

00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:06.720
look around and there'd be

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.559
i'd see another couple

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:10.159
with the husband and taking care of the

00:27:10.159 --> 00:27:12.400
wife but they were 80.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.600
you know we were 20.

00:27:15.679 --> 00:27:18.000
and um

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.720
so i went home

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.880
i think louie's trying to make himself

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.559

desperately tried to find this very sad

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:47.600
video

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.840
by yelling at bobby

the rest of us i swear as we were

00:28:51.679 --> 00:28:53.679

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.960

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.840
i was the whole time maybe i just i

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.399
thought he was a friend of oliver

00:29:22.399 --> 00:29:23.919
i thought we all knew him we all do oh

00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:24.720
yeah

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.960
we're not

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.600
you can't watch that video without not

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.720
crying it's one of the most saddest

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.039
things in the world oh no also mike was

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:35.120
like one of like the rawest yeah

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.480
filthiest like

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.200
he loved this show i think

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.960
oh yeah yeah for sure he was like 70. he

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.399
had no idea how to download a podcast

00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:43.679
but yeah he would have figured out that

00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:46.080
crazy newfangled technology

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.600
explained it to him

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.799
that's what him and mike bonded over

00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:52.240
their hatred of newfangled technology

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.279
these [ __ ] slopes with their goddamn

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:57.279
chinese technologies

00:29:57.279 --> 00:29:59.200
i uh mikey stefano would have loved this

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.440
show maybe not this episode so much but

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.799
uh but historically he would have

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:07.279
i stand by the joke made off of shane

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:09.360
assuming that she died and then went on

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.279
the last motorcycle i'm not disparaging

00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:12.399
any of those i just want to hear your

00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:13.679

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:15.200
going through this i want to hear you

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.679
were about to cry

00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:20.240
i want to hear about the cry and even if

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.720
i was i'll take ownership over it yeah i

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.679
mean

00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:25.279
what are the skanks going to attack me

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:26.960
on reddit i like that

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.240
which i'm not even on by the way

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.760
but i wasn't yeah

00:30:35.679 --> 00:30:37.919
go go join gas digital just so the

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:40.000
visual will face them like

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.159
that

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.880
i just want you cnn's

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.520
comic of the year

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.520
to acknowledge that the proud play's

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.440
least favorite comic that my motorcycle

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.000
zombie joke was on point and will you

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.640
acknowledge this yes i offer jokes

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.320
i'm not for censorship

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.159
what i want you to say is that was

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:01.600
really funny

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.960
that was really funny but i felt the

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.480
need to put it into some kind of context

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.919
because maybe your fans don't know who

00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:07.840
this man was i think they do oh maybe

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.440
they don't yeah so it's good to like

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.039
probably set it up and explain it hold

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:12.799
on what can i say and then mike can i

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:14.320
also say something i just want you to

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.080
acknowledge that all your anger should

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.440
be towards lewis i'm not saying you

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.919
shouldn't be angry i'm not angry

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:21.919
you're pretty wound up but i want you to

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:23.440
i want you to know you should put it all

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.679
towards lewis who's conducted all of

00:31:25.679 --> 00:31:27.679
this can i say something when i honestly

00:31:27.679 --> 00:31:29.519
said mike's actually the only one that's

00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:31.120
gonna cry here i wasn't [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.640

the [ __ ] off me dude i was i felt

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.640
because mike's italian he can't feel

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.200
emotions any other way from him

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.200
you almost took a swipe at shane when

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.600
that real anger should be directed

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.880
at lewis

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.799
can i say this

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:47.919
can you you should be angry at yourself

00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:51.760
let me tell you why oh jesus christ

00:31:51.919 --> 00:31:54.320

swear to you it's not even the jokes

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.600

this guy is and what he meant to us and

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.559
then you can joke

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:08.159
but we did also say he told his joke

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:10.080
before also it came up because he was

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.440

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.640
you stop lewis

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.360
i didn't suggest bringing this video up

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.120
i go to the tape it's a hundred percent

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.559
lewis saying i don't know why we were

00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:51.840
going to watch this i didn't know it was

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.360
gonna go in this direction what do you

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.720

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.240
gonna talk about i don't [ __ ] know my

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.640
hand oh in this direction

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.399
when there was a break in the action and

00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:02.080
bobby was trying to find the video

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.399
that's when i had to say my mic

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:06.640
breaking the action

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.039
we don't have an agenda it was a major

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:10.399
break in the action

00:33:10.399 --> 00:33:11.440
twice

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.039
because we had the wrong video the first

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:15.600
time but i wanted to say

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.279
we keep flaring up

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:20.159
it's louis is the problem here

00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:22.559
mike i am barely a part of this podcast

00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:23.360
okay

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.120
it's louis look like here's what

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.279
happened okay mike was with kind of like

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:28.799
oh we're having fun we're joking around

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:29.840
he made the point he was like well it

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.960
should be pointed out and he's right

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.080
should be pointed out this was a good

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.519
friend of ours

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:35.360
it was what happened though was when and

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.760
i felt it too when that story came on it

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.600
hit the emotion in all of us yes and we

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.679
all processed the emotion differently

00:33:41.679 --> 00:33:42.960
some of us not only

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.120
old school some of us didn't progress at

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.200
all it's like this sergeant i cried in

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.919
that video actually i didn't push it

00:33:49.919 --> 00:33:52.240
down

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.279
i'll defend you a little bit here i

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:54.399
didn't defend you let me defend lewis a

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:56.320
little bit here lewis does show up with

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.159
a hand agenda

00:33:58.159 --> 00:34:00.000
okay he's got a hand agenda

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.080
now number five if you read is impeached

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.120
trump

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.200
but you gotta get on there about my

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.200
mikey uh mikey d came up because he

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.720
mentioned the joke

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.960
that one so that can so then lewis goes

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.240
yeah and there was something like and

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.919
they reminded us about the story and

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:16.240
then for whatever reason

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.320
we were having hilarious timings that's

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.919
the saddest story and then we had fun

00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:21.040
with the zombie thing remember that was

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.399
the funny man remember that ghost rider

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:23.919
joke it's not a question of what's going

00:34:23.919 --> 00:34:25.359
on between us

00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:26.879
we're on a podcast here we're not just

00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:28.560
hanging out so there's listeners who do

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.159
not know who he is wait what right they

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:31.839
don't know our relationship with them or

00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:32.800
we did

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.320
saying it was a great comic friends of

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.879
ours this is the stand logo yeah we've

00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:38.320
also talked about well i want to go back

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.599
to something you're telling me there are

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:41.359
people listening to this oh we're never

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:42.639
going to have careers no what are you

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.560
kidding me so what i'm saying mike is no

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.720
no i get it i get everything i'm

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.119
agreeing

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.520
up to there and there was no reason to

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.320
hyper explain how much he meant to us

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.280
and to lewis i started playing asking

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.000
the play two full long videos of sad

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.040
stories

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.800
that other story wasn't even worse the

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.720
story was nothing

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.480
the first story wasn't that good i don't

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.920
from the little parts we saw that other

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.359
story i think that one was pretty sad

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:12.960
too yeah what do you keep in mind while

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.880
i tell you that lewis is the person you

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.200
want to blame here lewis is informing

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.160
you that

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.000
you are infected oh i'm the person to

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.880
blame

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.320
for getting emotional on a video you

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.720
need to look in the mirror

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:28.079
he's asking you to make a change

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.839
like no message could be made any

00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:31.200
clearer

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.480
if you want to make the world a better

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.359
place

00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:34.800
take a look at yourself and then make

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.079
that

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:37.760
change

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.839
he's doing a michael jackson song i get

00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:41.520
it no i was just saying that's not just

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.960
thoughts off the top of his head

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.079
i'm sitting next to him right now and

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:48.000
i'm feeling these [ __ ] the weird

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.480
thing is i'm i'm almost certain that all

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.240
of mike's anger at lewis is going to be

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.839
taken out on shane and i don't know i

00:35:53.839 --> 00:35:55.839
know i'm i'm next to the summit what i

00:35:55.839 --> 00:35:58.079
find weird is i think there's anger

00:35:58.079 --> 00:35:59.599
coming towards me and i'm literally

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:01.200
trying to piece everything up that i

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.720
feel i don't think mike's actually angry

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.160
i think he's not angry that we keep on

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.480
calling him i'm not i'm not angry i just

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.560
had to say i can go on disappointment

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.320
you can say whatever you guys want now

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.280
but i had to say my piece about my

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.720
apparently my relationship thank you

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.440
you know you felt bad that we were

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.880
laughing out of context you felt like

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.079
you were laughing at a friend of yours

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:25.040
that died that no i i i know you guys so

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.960
i know you no no you can't do that

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.960
that's not so yeah i just wanted to set

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.720
it up properly because there's people

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.400
listening who don't know that and then i

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.240
think what happened was there was that

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.920
and i agree with you on all of it but

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.200
then what happened was we were actually

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.400
watching the thing and then mike was

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.520
like what are we doing here because this

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.000
is actually like just [ __ ] sad it's

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.359
really sad yeah and i agree with you on

00:36:43.359 --> 00:36:45.119
that i actually did feel the same way

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:46.400
but we just handled it in different ways

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.000
like i just shut down a little bit and

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.520

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.359

00:36:53.359 --> 00:36:55.760
punch someone so i don't know

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.800
i just thought we were gonna get into

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.720
some more zombie riffing

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.040

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.640

hey can we what do you want to say that

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:05.760
that video like that that he's right

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.960
dave is right that made me

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.640
i responded that way to this perfectly

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.359
planned podcast

00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:17.359
not only was it a perfectly planned

00:37:17.359 --> 00:37:19.520
agenda can i tell you the agenda mike

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.040
it's not just planned it's actually

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.440
scripted we knew what you would react to

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.839
and this was all written out yes

00:37:25.839 --> 00:37:27.680
that's why shane had me sit here it

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.960
wasn't because he couldn't fit this is

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.400

thought we'd make it all right shane

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.320
that would have crushed 10 minutes ago

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.079

for you guys listening just insert that

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.079

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.160
you get a feeling like oh this guy's

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.440
breaking my balls but i know this is

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.319
from love

and and and i know we're all comics so i

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.400

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.000
it and i can feel it from its place

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
where it's like [ __ ] you yeah and then

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.920
if i feel that then it's gonna be a

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.839
problem right well yeah i just it was

00:42:09.839 --> 00:42:11.040
the only other time i've only seen you

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.440

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.040
i have a slow i have a slow burn

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.240
how long do you stay angry i feel like

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.160

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.839
very very no but if i squash it i can

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:24.079
squat i can squash it

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:25.680
outside you think

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.440
you'll be back maybe by the end can you

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.040
squash it with louis now so

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.760
again if you have a beef with the show i

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.040
sold my shares years ago so i've been

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.200
i've been out he's a [ __ ] instigator

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.280
that's problem i i was just trying to

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.119
create silliness as i do yeah i just

00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:53.200
wanted to say that about mike like i

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.200
have no problem yeah i told you i wanted

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.720
to say that about it

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.160
that was

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.240
he can call me gay i get how jokes work

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.000
yeah but he might get a high single one

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:02.720
man

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.960

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.319
we were all like friends with him and

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:07.599
you were very very close friends with

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:09.359
him yes and then so then lewis would get

00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:11.520
back to his bit of making us watch a

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.680

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.000
wife's slow death and i think also you

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.440
know this is how he found it he had aids

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.520
was her finding us by the way by the way

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.160
i will say in fairness mike

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.920
just to be realistic here if you weren't

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.400
here i think everyone felt the vibe of

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.560
discomfort when it started playing so

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.800
that's why but we will take shots i mean

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.640
we tried to do the

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.480
you know we talk about the school

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.240
shootings the day it happens and say

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.200
things that are different no you're

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.800
right i'm self-aware enough to know that

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.480
i had an emotional reaction like dave

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.319
dave nailed it i'm not fighting like

00:43:56.319 --> 00:43:57.839
dave nailed it the right thing by the

00:43:57.839 --> 00:44:00.000
way i had an emotional reaction to it

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.680
yeah sure you literally watched the

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.640
video you haven't watched your friend in

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.839
a long time and you [ __ ] dude

00:44:03.839 --> 00:44:06.240

you got the last word you call the [ __ ]

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.800
and move on

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.280
yeah damn that's a great yeah you have

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.040
no idea how many bear crawls up and down

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.040
his hallway he just induced dude he's

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.319
going to get home

00:44:24.319 --> 00:44:25.839
take his shirt off and just be doing

00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:27.760
plyos in his living room

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.760
that's more infuriating than anything

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.160
you could have said nobody's got a [ __ ]

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.839
so anyway we're done with this topic now

00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:35.680
and there'll be no retarts god you're a

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.839
[ __ ] no but i understand i understand

00:44:37.839 --> 00:44:39.359
that in uh and

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:41.119
i may be beating it to death but uh

00:44:41.119 --> 00:44:42.079
whatever

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.599
i understand that that was a joke like

00:44:43.599 --> 00:44:45.280
i'm not i'm not stupid it wasn't he

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.400
didn't i guess

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.920
he didn't go derozan i could tell that

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.000
was coming from a [ __ ] silly fun i

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.480
didn't i wasn't like hatred [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.720
you it wasn't like that yeah

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.480
but i know the difference

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.480
you know and derosa did like i'm not

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.319
[ __ ] on deroza on the podcast like

00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:02.000
we just had that beef and then it was a

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.359
[ __ ] moment and that probably your

00:45:03.359 --> 00:45:04.560
beef in that moment probably came from

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.000
something different because derosa you

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.440
guys started comedy together you moved

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.720
to new york and you've been a little

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.400
more sensitive since you were nominated

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.040
buzzfeeds

00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:19.240

match to me but maybe

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.640
stem cells i mean that's if he [ __ ]

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.319

i just i boot house row

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.880
it's difficult to pill the swallow that

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.800
pete davidson has any sort of depression

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.880

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.359
saying chemicals no but look we all know

00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:49.040
right like there could be someone

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.599
someone could be like a [ __ ]

00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:54.319
like mexican immigrant who's a bus boy

00:50:54.319 --> 00:50:56.160
who's just really happy to be in america

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.760
is like happy with their life and then

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.960
someone could be a billionaire and

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.200
struggle from depression i get it but it

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.640
is hard

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.680
for all of us to publicly feel bad for

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.119
the billionaire who's struggling from

00:51:07.119 --> 00:51:08.720
depression it's just not that pete's a

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.800
billionaire i'm just using it he's a

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.040
billionaire and [ __ ] in terms of hell

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.400
yeah

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.400
this [ __ ] is the richest man alive when

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.720
he lacks in money he he is wealthy and

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.960
[ __ ] and he doesn't like anything it's

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.520
just is if you if you are pete if you're

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.160
a guy who's who's just a celebrity and

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.079
you're [ __ ] celebrity chicks and

00:51:28.079 --> 00:51:30.000
you're depressed you should handle that

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.040
with like your circle and a professional

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.960
but you shouldn't just tweet about it

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.800
because you're tweeting to like a whole

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.480
universe of people of course who are

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.119
just getting real problems like yeah

00:51:41.119 --> 00:51:43.119
it's infuriating when he's bitching

00:51:43.119 --> 00:51:44.400
about his problems i'm literally going

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.440

minute pete would [ __ ] put a gun in

00:51:49.359 --> 00:51:50.400
his mouth

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.000
literally 30 seconds into my life pete

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.760
would be dead that's it he didn't take

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.760

long time

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:17.319
from my pace

01:06:18.079 --> 01:06:21.520
if i'm being completely honest

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.280
i wish you'd shower closer to sex

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.520
it's a little musty

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.319
but you know beggars can't be choosers

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.790

could just to shut her up but i need her

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.599
to pick up my lower body

01:06:49.599 --> 01:06:53.119
and shove it into her face

01:06:53.119 --> 01:06:56.799
like a pie eating contest

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.319
she wants your face

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.160
how insane is it that you'd literally

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.079
just sit this couple down and just start

01:07:08.079 --> 01:07:09.599
poking at something like that so what

01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:10.720
just kind of

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.880
ticks you off about dating this guy

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.720
she's like well it's like everything now

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.480

01:07:17.839 --> 01:07:19.280
me yeah it's always like i don't know

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.559
getting from the living room to the

01:07:20.559 --> 01:07:22.960
dining room uh if i want to do something

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.240
upstairs

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:29.039
there's steps steps with my steps

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.880
i don't know not having to put him into

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.559
a car seat and take him out of it every

01:07:34.559 --> 01:07:36.960
time we go somewhere we had uh we went

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.480
to philadelphia i had to explain what

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.280
the top of the rocky steps were like

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.520
he made me yell down you can see all the

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.000
flags from up here honey

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.240
can you imagine like you're you're doing

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.359
a thing where you're going to interview

01:07:49.359 --> 01:07:50.640
this couple and you're like all right

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.119
let's ask the first question what sucks

01:07:53.119 --> 01:07:54.480
about this

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.559
yeah yeah i don't know what doesn't dude

01:07:56.559 --> 01:07:58.400
what the [ __ ] kind of question is i'm

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.000
waiting for this man to die so i can

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.160
collect money just making her think of

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.920
things even if she didn't have one ready

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.119
you were going to make her start

01:08:05.119 --> 01:08:07.039
thinking of them yeah mobility change

01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:09.039
his diaper does that make you have a

01:08:09.039 --> 01:08:11.920
hard time respecting him as a man

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.400
was uh was the first was when she said

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.480
you made me ask that about the or say

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:18.960
that about the physical issues

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.719
through the interviewer yeah yes and

01:08:20.719 --> 01:08:22.480
there's no that was too bad that was a

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.960
shame he

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:31.920
and he was like say you love his body

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.199
and then they laughed together i was

01:08:33.199 --> 01:08:35.040
like whoa whoa whoa whoa i think she

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.759
said it to her all right good regardless

01:08:37.759 --> 01:08:38.880
he

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.960
could have edited that out yeah he put

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.880
it in this is a very slickly edited

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:45.120
video and he kept in a clip of her going

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.640
i love his body

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.400
what you told me to say that because

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.480
even he knew no one would believe it

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.640
tell him you love my body

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:53.440

no i mean this guy that shane

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.239
for some reason i think he's a genius

01:09:08.239 --> 01:09:09.600
because he's got a big head and he's in

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.480
a chair

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.759
oh it's probably oh man he looks like

01:09:11.759 --> 01:09:12.719
this

01:09:12.719 --> 01:09:14.640
[ __ ] yeah he might be a super villain

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.120
timmy timmy from south fork yeah but uh

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.560
maybe he is a genius i don't know i

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.920
think this girl's i feel like this girl

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.000
is fleecing him for she has no i don't

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.839
know whatever she's doing is crazy

01:09:23.839 --> 01:09:25.679
what's this again he says it because

01:09:25.679 --> 01:09:28.080
look up the the shelf muscular atrophy

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.239
something muscular spinal muscular

01:09:30.239 --> 01:09:31.440
type 2

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.040
if i had a gas and i'm not being shitty

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:33.759
here

01:09:33.759 --> 01:09:35.920
i'm sure that his his life expectancy is

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.679
pretty [ __ ] low and i'm sure that

01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:39.679
he's got some sort of like crazy [ __ ]

01:09:39.679 --> 01:09:41.359
health insurance thing that she's like

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:42.960
yeah [ __ ] it dude i'll take care of this

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.640
guy for a few more years and then i get

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.080
all this cash

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.839
maybe maybe

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.719
insurance i'm sure there's some like

01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:54.000
other [ __ ] by the way we might just

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.440
be pieces of [ __ ] because we just see

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.760
someone doing the greatest thing ever

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.199
here's what has to be

01:09:59.199 --> 01:10:01.360
in our minds but i believe lewis's

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.600
version of is so much more likely the

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.280
truth than she's waiting for the money

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.440
she just loves his body love really no

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.880
one believes this cute chick we'll do we

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.320
just have no faith goes that girl's too

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.400
pretty to be nice i've made girls that

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.080
are literally two points less hot than

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.640
her my live-in girlfriend

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.239
i might be kidding dude she's so much

01:10:18.239 --> 01:10:19.760
hotter you can you remember girlfriends

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.440
that i've had that are substantially

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.440
less hot than this chick sure

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.920
it's crazy

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.280
it comes it comes with the story of how

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.640
they met how they got together that

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.480
really majority live into an early

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.080
adulthood and with proper care many live

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.000
well into adulthood what was what's

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.400
early adulthood 20s

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.320
she's out of her mind she's out of her

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.080
mind and loves this attention

01:10:42.159 --> 01:10:43.440
it's probably like

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.280
the attention she gets everyone's like

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.960
oh you're a saint i feel like you got a

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.159
girl and that's what i've been i think

01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:50.000
he pulled in a girl in his interview

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.520
and said to say it's his girlfriend now

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.560
i think they're really dating i don't

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.960
think that let me see more i need more

seven experienced the weather the world

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.760
assumed

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.000
so much about me because of the way i

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.480

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.880

01:19:03.679 --> 01:19:05.840
sorry i mean i was romantically walking

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:06.719
you

01:19:06.719 --> 01:19:08.880
i was on a walk i was really dragging

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.520
him yeah she goes i had my hand wrapped

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.400

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.800
oh man jesus

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.480
a couple of weeks ago i thought that he

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.960
clearly looked like a couple a father

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.440
with a group of kids runs up to me and

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.040
is like kids are climbing on him they

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.920
think he's a [ __ ] jungle gym

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.760
and i was like excuse me

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.120
and the guy was like does he want to

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.440
play with bubbles and shane was like no

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.679

time that i'm not safe in my life do you

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.800
think the problem is he doesn't have the

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.880
lung capacity to blow bubbles or he just

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.440
didn't want to play bubbles

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.719

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:25.920
be over the first part

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.639

she's a saint or that the guy making the

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.000

she was abused as a child and is all

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.239
[ __ ] in the head i can't believe

01:21:40.239 --> 01:21:41.760
anything else maybe people are just

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.080
better than i imagined they could be but

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.639
i i can't accept that it's some it's

01:21:46.639 --> 01:21:48.480
like

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.639
i just yeah i can't believe that she's

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:52.719
like i mean there are women who will

01:21:52.719 --> 01:21:55.199
[ __ ] date guys in wheelchairs you

01:21:55.199 --> 01:21:56.560

i don't know but there's also women that

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.480
are maybe the other thing is she could

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.719
also be really asexual right because

01:22:06.719 --> 01:22:08.239
i've known girls that weren't really

01:22:08.239 --> 01:22:09.840
sexual at all but you made it happen

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.840
anyway

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.360
but you didn't take no furniture i had

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.960
girls that told me they were asexual

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.199
they told me that

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:19.600
they weren't

01:22:20.239 --> 01:22:22.000
broke that pinhole open

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.040
that [ __ ] had 18

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.120
you know chat my lips were after sucking

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.000
80 titties [ __ ] 12 throats

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.560
80 titties

01:22:48.719 --> 01:22:50.480
like the last like frame of this yeah

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.320
they get the gum shot already yeah like

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.719
what happens i get the interview part

01:22:54.719 --> 01:22:57.679
when then i start [ __ ]

01:22:57.679 --> 01:22:59.199
so uh this is normally the part where

01:22:59.199 --> 01:23:01.840
the talent uh what if you just like uh

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.280
you just cut to the end and it's not

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.480
that guy anymore it's just a big

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.159
muscular black dude in her and they're

01:23:06.159 --> 01:23:07.920
like so i got out of that or it shows

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.600
the kid falls the kid's asleep in the

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.800
chair and the host of the show just

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.719

this wasn't a visit that was going to

01:23:24.719 --> 01:23:25.520
end

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.480
um

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:28.480
it was a really

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.320
comforting and

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.400
relaxing this is really just a nice

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.960
thing you say to a young person who does

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:37.679
not believe they're worthy of love

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:39.990
look at me

01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:44.320
[Laughter]

yeah get it together jerk off can i be

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
honest it's probably not gonna happen

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.719
for you yeah odds are against it you

01:24:00.719 --> 01:24:02.400
know one in a million what are you

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.920
saying

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:06.080
isn't that a crazy question that this

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.239
guy just asked them what's his name well

01:24:08.239 --> 01:24:10.239
he's it's like the answer is what's

01:24:10.239 --> 01:24:11.840
happening here he doesn't even need an

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:14.320
answer what do you say to him smell my

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.320
fingers

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.920
you have to bring your head down to my

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.120
hands but smell them

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.080
um

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.239
yeah well you know god bless them you

01:24:30.239 --> 01:24:31.360
know

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.880
the whole point was that the guys it's

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.320
fake inspirational the guy who's

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.760
channeled it well yeah all of these

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.520
channels i'd say so i think it's like

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.199
how many followers does he have lewis

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:40.719

01:24:40.719 --> 01:24:44.159
want seven million it's a lot and yeah

01:24:44.159 --> 01:24:46.159
1.5 you're pretty close wow oh no that's

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:56.880
million

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.320
so it's just a little bit weird that

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.639
you're like you're going around kind of

01:25:00.639 --> 01:25:02.080
you know putting yourself on a pedestal

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.159

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:43.280
woman in arizona can we win uh mike

this maybe i don't know we'll see what's

01:25:46.239 --> 01:25:47.120
up

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:49.840
uh there was a woman in arizona who

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.080
was i guess a vegetable

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.199
oh yeah

01:25:53.199 --> 01:25:56.800
and uh she gave birth to a great topic

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.440
she's your birth birth to a baby we like

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.480
to end with something everyone forgets

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.480
uh her alleged assault is a me too wake

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:06.639
up call this is the waking call by the

01:26:06.639 --> 01:26:10.719
way wake wake-up call pretty hilarious

01:26:10.719 --> 01:26:12.639
this is a very eye-opening experience i

01:26:12.639 --> 01:26:14.320
hope it was a shame

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.639
she wouldn't be here if she had woken up

01:26:16.639 --> 01:26:18.480
um so yeah i made it straight out of

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.320
kill bill right my name is buck and i

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.480
like to [ __ ] yeah and here's the other

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:23.440
thing is i didn't realize when you're in

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.239
a vegetative state i felt like your your

01:26:26.239 --> 01:26:27.520
body's shut down you're not aware of

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.800
anything apparently when you're in a

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.800
vegetative state you're aware of things

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.120
you can't do anything

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.960
is that true yes across

01:26:44.639 --> 01:26:46.400
yeah but yeah i don't think you're right

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.520
about that at all there might be some

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.800
cases no i mean if you're falsely

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.719
accusing someone of

01:26:50.719 --> 01:26:52.639
then yeah maybe that's not right i i

01:26:52.639 --> 01:26:54.560
read this specifically about this story

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.159
but a vegetative state will be people

01:26:56.159 --> 01:26:58.080
who are like brain dead no it does not

01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.840
mean brain dead no but i mean that also

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:00.639
isn't

01:27:00.639 --> 01:27:02.480
the definition of a vegetable no i know

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.639
but that is also under the umbrella of a

01:27:04.639 --> 01:27:06.639
vegetative state i don't know what that

01:27:06.639 --> 01:27:09.199
is because uh when you're all right i i

01:27:09.199 --> 01:27:10.800
was with you until i read this article

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.239
and i was like yes i was like all right

01:27:12.239 --> 01:27:13.199
that's not that bad there's no real

01:27:13.199 --> 01:27:14.960
victim there she's [ __ ] you know

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.159
that's not what i was saying at all

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.679
but then you realize that this woman is

01:27:25.679 --> 01:27:27.920
[ __ ] completely conscious but she

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.760
can't do anything or move or [ __ ]

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:33.280
enjoy it at all

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.159
damn

01:27:34.159 --> 01:27:35.760

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.080

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.440
yeah read it up

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.199
how do they know she's aware

01:27:41.199 --> 01:27:42.400
i don't know

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.800
you're making this all up lois

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.360
she's completely unaware uh yo wink at

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.040

[Laughter]

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.159
yeah see that even if you're a vegetable

01:28:46.159 --> 01:28:47.760
all you are is a healthy complex

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.679
carbohydrate

01:28:49.679 --> 01:28:51.199
i was seeing if siri did vegetable for

01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:00.719
what uh what does it say the definition

01:29:00.719 --> 01:29:03.280
of vegetative status

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.120
[ __ ] chilling it would be very rare

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.800
for a person to move directly from coma

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:11.040
or vegeta or vegetative state to a state

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.440
bobby likes to go with that first thing

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.040
google gives you quote

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:18.639
yeah that's a shitty quote always that's

01:29:18.639 --> 01:29:20.639
from some website it's just an absence

01:29:20.639 --> 01:29:22.639
of responsiveness or awareness due to

01:29:22.639 --> 01:29:25.040
overwhelming dysfunction of the cerebral

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.760
what does it say cerebral cerebral

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:31.040
hemispheres with sufficient sparing of

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:31.920
the

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.840
hold on

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.040
you start getting your voice like the

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.239
next you don't even know what the next

01:29:36.239 --> 01:29:39.719
word is going to be

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.920
absence of responsiveness and awareness

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.719
in the first few words it seems to go up

01:29:54.719 --> 01:29:56.000
wow

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.840

sesame street oh

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.920

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:14.000

i'm picking this vegetable i like to

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.520
wake up from a coma and realize you

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:03.520
never returned jumanji to blockbuster

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:05.360
when you went into a coma 17 years ago

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.080
oh [ __ ] i'm in trouble [ __ ] i owe some

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.520
fees

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:12.960
blockbusters like 140 oh my goodness

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.840
they lost i think tens of thousands of

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.639
dollars to blockbuster in like late fees

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:20.480
you'd find a movie like under your bed

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.080
under a point you're the reason they

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:23.600
closed

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.920
yeah i got arrested i got arrested for

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.840
uh a ticket because i didn't go it was a

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.360
benchmark i didn't go to court because

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.760
the video store sued me for

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.120
fees

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.639
that's the pussiest reason to ever get

01:31:34.639 --> 01:31:36.480
arrested it was porn i think it was like

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.400
because it was mom and pop place so i

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.080
went there for porn they didn't have

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.440
porn applause my mom and dad had porn to

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.960
their house yeah

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.400
wait you got it ready to go to the back

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:45.280
section

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.120
yeah they go yeah with the saloon doors

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.159
yeah

01:31:48.159 --> 01:31:50.080
you got arrested for

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:52.960
what because i like the place

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:54.800
the place takes you to court if you

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:55.840
don't pay your late fees but they don't

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.600
like i'm sure they tell you but so you

01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.360
don't show up for courses at the time of

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:00.719
email though this is the time of email

01:32:00.719 --> 01:32:01.840
and i wouldn't have looked at a piece of

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.280
mail that was like a thing like that

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:05.199
probably i could easily miss it so i

01:32:05.199 --> 01:32:06.560
didn't know i just didn't go to court so

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:07.920
there's a bank so you got arrested for

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.360
the debt so it's always like it's only

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:10.880
like a hundred dollar like ticket or

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:11.920
whatever to get out then you got to go

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.679
to court again but like it's not that

01:32:13.679 --> 01:32:15.040
big of a deal but it's i did get

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.480
actually arrested for it like what's

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.920
your cuffs and putting them with you

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:20.639
spent the night over no no like an hour

01:32:20.639 --> 01:32:22.320
but still so they can cough i thought it

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.080
just like becomes like a debt and they

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:26.159
[ __ ] just know warrant was also the

01:32:26.159 --> 01:32:27.920
plot of the porn that he rented

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:30.239
a cell for porn that was the name

01:32:30.239 --> 01:32:31.360
well

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.560
at the end of the day

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.400
it's because uh

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:37.280
i didn't pay fees but yes if you could

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.560
boil it down

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.880
to his i yes porn i gotta risk for porn

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.040
it was no the the but the actual you

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.239
gotta arrest it for now you're not going

01:32:44.239 --> 01:32:45.520
up to the court

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.560
that you're gonna show over here they

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.560
suited me i know but that's still

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.400
crazy oh yeah i thought you just lost

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.360
the lawsuit it's still pretty cool

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.199
no no because it was this way the way it

01:32:55.199 --> 01:32:57.280
was they take you there too it was crazy

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.280
there's no way to win the lawsuit

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.360
like they have full-on evidence what is

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.800

of a coma we talked for hours

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.840
and she was like oh my god i've never

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.880
felt like a soul mate with someone

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.280
put a baby inside of me and i did and

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:43.119
then she was like she was like i've

01:34:43.119 --> 01:34:44.880
never been happier than right now and i

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.639
was like me too baby

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:48.239

01:34:48.239 --> 01:34:50.080
i hate saying it

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.400
and then

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.600
she just slipped away

01:34:56.159 --> 01:35:00.560
and uh back to newer vegetative state

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.639
with our beautiful baby in there

01:35:02.639 --> 01:35:05.760
she's like a sex cicada

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:09.760
every 17 years she wakes up and [ __ ] me

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.400
how could they prove that that didn't

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.000
happen i'll tell you what we just gave

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.719
this guy a sick ass defense

01:35:16.719 --> 01:35:18.000

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.040
believe us on my ship

01:35:21.199 --> 01:35:22.239
and then i was like what am i gonna go

01:35:22.239 --> 01:35:23.440
through all the paperwork she's back in

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.840
a coma

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.880
paperwork

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.520
we had a special moment one night he's

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.280
like i've been uh i've been very alone

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.639
ever since

01:35:34.639 --> 01:35:36.320
it's [ __ ] up

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.920
there's literally no way to prove what

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:39.600
happened that night you know i think

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:43.480
there's a pretty she woke up

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:58.080
but she raped me this is uh

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:00.639
you kind of

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.920
maybe she got more in sewer for rape

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.840
this is very rough i had to put her back

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:08.560
into a coma

01:36:08.719 --> 01:36:11.600
it seems almost like he should win the

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:14.239
lawsuit like if he had like a good

01:36:14.239 --> 01:36:15.760
lawyer they'd be like this is a classic

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:18.719
case if he said no one said

01:36:18.719 --> 01:36:20.719
sir if you would just get a hilarious

01:36:20.719 --> 01:36:22.080
lawyer you could probably get out of

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:25.080
this

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.920
that's [ __ ] so funny to say sir she

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:30.880
woke up in a crazed state now

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.159
i'm telling you this because i

01:36:32.159 --> 01:36:33.760
understand to some degree and i know i

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:36.080
shouldn't pick the blame myself but

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:38.480
she woke up very confused and she raped

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.320
me and then i had to put her back down

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.400
she says she says

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:47.440
you now the world next and i am a

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:50.639
patriot and i had to put her back down

01:36:50.639 --> 01:36:53.760
okay but not before she stole my seed

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.760
yeah i mean i tried to get it out of her

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.600
imagine him testing that lie on one of

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:00.159
his co-workers and being like yo dude i

01:37:00.159 --> 01:37:01.760

it's part of a new sort of a new project

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.040
if she couldn't feel anything

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.199
if she couldn't feel anything

01:40:03.199 --> 01:40:04.080
what

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:06.000
if she couldn't feel anything do you

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.639
think it's less of a crime than

01:40:08.639 --> 01:40:11.520
a woman that could feel it yes wait why

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:12.239
wait

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:13.280
did you not want us to answer

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.639
immediately

01:40:14.639 --> 01:40:16.239
i thought i thought we were doing like

01:40:16.239 --> 01:40:20.639
one of those quick fire test things yeah

01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:23.760
yeah absolutely yes absolutely it's less

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.199
of a crime you're a judge no no no i

01:40:25.199 --> 01:40:26.880
mean it's still the same crime still the

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:29.119
same crime but it's less it's less wrong

01:40:29.119 --> 01:40:31.119
i bet every single victim of that crime

01:40:31.119 --> 01:40:32.639
has been like man i wish i was [ __ ]

01:40:32.639 --> 01:40:34.719
knocked out for that one i wish i wish

01:40:34.719 --> 01:40:36.560
it was a vegetable for life

01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:37.360
guys

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.920
if it like uh if it if it comes down to

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:41.600
if she couldn't feel it at all it's

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.600
almost like it's not the human crime of

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.040
rape it's more just like a property

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.560
rights violation like you're like was

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.320
that your woman or was that it's almost

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:49.920
like borrowing someone's tv without

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.280
permission

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.080
guys

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.080

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.199

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:02.560
island it's just you

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.400
and a woman in a coma we'll say she's

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:05.280
average

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:09.679
five minutes five minutes five minutes

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.920

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.239
you and her everyone else is dead she's

01:41:16.239 --> 01:41:17.920
[ __ ] breathing but she's just she's

01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:19.840
alive she's not decaying or rotting at

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:20.639
all

01:41:20.639 --> 01:41:22.400

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.320
frustrated easily so i'd be like i'm

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:25.840

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:28.320
can't get it off the plane

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.159

01:41:30.159 --> 01:41:33.040
then back in here then

01:41:34.159 --> 01:41:36.000

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.239
if you go on twitter

01:45:04.239 --> 01:45:05.679
and you're just if you were to type like

01:45:05.679 --> 01:45:07.679
some sort of like [ __ ] meme of like

01:45:07.679 --> 01:45:09.360
people being excited right no i

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:11.360
understand there's the black gifts that

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.880
are all over it's not really memes dude

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:15.360
that one was so racist it's so hilarious

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:16.719
well those are i've never seen that one

01:45:16.719 --> 01:45:18.000
before forget to forget but i don't

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:18.880
think that

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.560
yeah they're talking about the [ __ ]

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:22.080
gifts where it's like

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:23.840
there'll be a reaction

01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.119
it'll be like you know [ __ ] michael

01:45:25.119 --> 01:45:27.119
jackson eating popcorn two white chicks

01:45:27.119 --> 01:45:29.040
talking and then one of them on twitter

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:30.719
and then somebody sends a gift like a

01:45:30.719 --> 01:45:32.000
black chick like that kind of [ __ ] right

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.159
there yeah yeah yeah but that's already

01:45:34.159 --> 01:45:36.560
a black dude doing this ridiculous thing

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:39.360
yeah it's his face

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.280
because they're saying that's racist the

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:43.280
idea is you're using their face as your

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:46.400
face in that moment oh i get it yeah wow

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:47.520
i've never realized how awesome

01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:49.360
blackface was before but it's just a

01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:50.960
funny but it's just a funny it's usually

01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:52.880
just a funny gif right right yeah

01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:54.560
usually but yeah there's this one that's

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.320
the famous one where the uh is it

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.480
pronounced jeff i think it's gaff

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:00.159
actually a lot of there's uh if you're

01:46:00.159 --> 01:46:01.840
if you're a [ __ ] about it yes

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:03.840
technically i think it is jif yeah but

01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:05.440
everybody calls it gif

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:06.639
i don't know i'll see i'm not talking

01:46:06.639 --> 01:46:10.000
about a gift yeah get your [ __ ] together

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.840
that's not even the same dude vecchio

01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:13.840
and me are about to ride on you guys

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:15.199
dude

01:46:15.199 --> 01:46:16.880
but that's a great one

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.639
no that's not blackface i never even

01:46:18.639 --> 01:46:20.480
know i love those but that's so funny

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:22.400
though that the family guy did that

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.480
a family guy they mocked that exact one

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:26.639
that's what they have that one that's

01:46:26.639 --> 01:46:28.480
used all the time yeah but that's

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:30.000
blackface i don't even know what the

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.880
original thing of that was if you

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.159
if you

01:46:34.159 --> 01:46:35.920
were to use that like for example like

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:38.320
let's say somebody were to

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:41.440
burn somebody on twitter and you were to

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.440
be watching it you would post that as a

01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:46.239
response to the bone like oh [ __ ] son

01:46:46.239 --> 01:46:48.080
but if you were a white person that's

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:49.920
racist i mean i wouldn't but someone

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.520
cooler than me would

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.440
i like no way that's racist i like

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.199
posting a gif every once in a while

01:46:55.199 --> 01:46:57.440
there's no way that's racist at all

01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:00.159
like because because the thing with what

01:47:00.159 --> 01:47:01.360
you're trying the message you're trying

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:03.280
to send is the message of what the

01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.280
original thing of that was you know what

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.880
i mean right if you're sending like the

01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:08.159
gay guy like you're just doing

01:47:08.159 --> 01:47:09.360
celebration

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:11.119
the scene of whatever that was was a gay

01:47:11.119 --> 01:47:12.800
guy dancing around celebrating it was

01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:13.840
you're using it for what it was meant to

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:15.600
be the problem is that black people are

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.440
much more out of context hilariously

01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:18.719
expressive

01:47:18.719 --> 01:47:20.960
so there's just more black

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.560
gifts out there than white gifts but are

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.159
there i bet there's just so many like

01:47:24.159 --> 01:47:25.760
white trash ones and all kinds of stuff

01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:26.960
well there's one like you know like take

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.960
my money fry from um

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:30.719
futurama there's only one gift you need

01:47:30.719 --> 01:47:34.080
and it's uh farley in the uh

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.000
flavor crystals

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.400
oh that's a great one which one

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:39.760
when you get the fake this is that they

01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:40.560
say

01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:42.880
you don't need anything else

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:44.719
discussion here what are you aware that

01:47:44.719 --> 01:47:46.320
that was actually flavor crystals that

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:49.480
he's like

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.719
yeah that's it that's all you need let's

01:47:52.719 --> 01:47:54.719
see that gif it's over that's all you

01:47:54.719 --> 01:47:57.360
need no matter what anybody sends you

01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:59.360
like what what

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:00.239
what

01:48:00.239 --> 01:48:01.840
what big jay's got an album that was

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.520

01:48:09.130 --> 01:48:11.040
[Laughter]

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:15.080
they're looking right at me

01:48:19.119 --> 01:48:21.119
yeah but it's it's just outrage culture

01:48:21.119 --> 01:48:22.320
people are looking for anything to be

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:23.920
upset about yeah it's not i don't even

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:26.480
hear about that it's not blackface

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:28.960
blackface would be better if that's what

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:30.800
it was like if you were just putting on

01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.800
blackface to

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:35.199
react to something like a sick burn that

01:48:35.199 --> 01:48:37.119
someone said at a party like someone

01:48:37.119 --> 01:48:38.400
just nailed someone and then you came

01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:39.760
right up with black face and we're like

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:42.239
ah got him that would be awesome but

01:48:42.239 --> 01:48:43.600
blackface is like you're committed to

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.840
that for the night a gif is just like

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.840

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.320
blackface there's a whole to do honestly

01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:53.840
it's a lot harder than you think to

01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:57.119
actually get it on like evenly

01:48:57.119 --> 01:48:59.679
