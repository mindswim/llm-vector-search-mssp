00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.119
have sent him to itt tech

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.400

[ __ ] produce a podcast which

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.080
apparently is one of the more

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.560
complicated jobs

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.159

have him back on we love lemaire yeah

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.600
but uh

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.880
i think it'd only be appropriate for

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.400
just a nice moment of silence and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.280

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.360
over the decision and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.519
you know the end of the day he knew i

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.959

his game for that i think he did he i

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.319
did yeah he probably didn't pause his

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.599
game the mayor strikes me as a guy who

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.040
doesn't pause his game

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.720

right yeah i get it see i get it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.000

i can stand for seven seconds that's my

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.600
legal right this is illegal you're

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.720
allowed to stare at a woman i think for

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.560
like i think it's three seconds

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.000
you're within your legal right to just

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.399
go yeah and then keep it moving you're

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:52.959
relaxing

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:55.040
no one can stop you from doing that i

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.959
think you can do i don't know

00:09:56.959 --> 00:09:58.959
what the what the age thing is how close

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:00.080
can you be

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.720

six feet you can't be up in there grill

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.519

oh yeah i think there is a foot thing i

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.720
think as long as you do i think if you

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.240
just give it your wingspan so if you go

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.440
up don't touch the girl

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.959
but if you go like i'm legally allowed

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:14.240
to do this i'm measuring the distance i

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.680
can be so i can stare at you for full

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.839
three seconds and i'll be on my way man

00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:19.680

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:23.040

if you're both walking on the sidewalk

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:26.640
you can hit him the whole

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.760
point where you can't turn your head

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.000

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.680
as long as you want while you're walking

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.120

you know i liked a couple other songs

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:11.520
but i think mayweather came out to

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.520
born in the usa when he fought against

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.840
ricky hatton really turned me entirely i

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.280

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.400

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.080
black guy from america fights a white

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.039

we're a ton of moving parts dude you got

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.200

it was like it sounded kind of gossipy

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.720
and i was like i'm not participating in

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.400
gossip and it was like dude you know you

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:52.960

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:05.760
yeah yeah it gets disconcerting when you

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.039
start thinking about how many parts of

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:07.919
yourself there are

00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:09.440

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.799

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:49.919
noodles in your trachea

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:52.240
yeah for sure i might pound some waters

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.080
to push them down

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.919

originally was kind of like

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.760
and the fact that it was called like the

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.760
renegade podcast i was like yeah this is

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.039
[ __ ] christ

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:15.039

you know have basically live on the

00:22:17.679 --> 00:22:19.919
outskirts of society

00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:22.159
oh man nothing bothers nelson bothers me

neither of them could remember the city

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.559
it's just a whirlwind but the uh they

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:33.760
met at a rally

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.440
and bruce is playing some songs for them

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.120
and uh you know

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.919
obama like bruce is kind of shy obama

00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:41.120
likes that

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.279
as you know under still waters they run

00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:44.400
deep dude yeah

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.279
or very shallow and they're just a

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:49.360
puddle

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.039
you know there's also that side of it

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:52.720
well bruce dude was funny i listened to

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.840
it to like

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.520
i was like [ __ ] this sucks and i

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.559
listened to it and i was like it's

00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:57.840
pretty engaging

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.360
them talking i'm sure it is i'm sure

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.120
it's very engaging both of them

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.279
are very charismatic man yeah but it was

00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:04.720
still like uh

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.120
i don't know it just bothers me it's

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.640
still of course it should

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.159
bother you i busted it it's called the

00:25:10.159 --> 00:25:11.760
renegades and basically

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.080
brock was like why would you be an

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.200
outsider

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.720
you know blah blah and he was like i'll

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.240
tell you brooke

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.600
dad was a schizophrenic guy

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.000
a rock mister mr president they both had

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.440
irish parents though they were both

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.640
shout out to ireland that's probably why

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.760
i was like this was all right because

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.720
they were like

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.320
yeah he's like my grandparents were

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.080
irish and you know they're a bit of

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.520
outsiders i was like yes

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.039
i'm ready yeah hearts are outsiders even

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:36.159
though we're literally the entire

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:37.039
population now

00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:39.919
yeah yeah like yeah oh i'm already gay

00:25:39.919 --> 00:25:41.200
too that's cool what else you got to say

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.880
bruce were you a mirror renegade

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.320
big time dude big time that's probably

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.080
what it was this is my shadow just being

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.840
like dude you're a [ __ ] renegade

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.640

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.400
claim renegade status yeah

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.320
but it was it was funny and barack obama

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.240
was like yeah my uh my grandparents were

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.080

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.080
yeah i did let's go

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.600
that was when my national that's when my

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.600
nationalism [ __ ] crushed my hatred of

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.120
just popular calls like no okay that's

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.000
cool

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.600
it is tight but yeah it was i'm not done

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.000
it yet but yeah the idea of it bothers

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.400
me

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.600
and it did hearing those two do the same

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.240
awkward podcast like intro ramble as

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.480
every like i guess we're doing this now

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.320
i was like god damn it get it together

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.000
yeah it made me sick to my stomach to be

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.440
doing podcasts actually

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.960
really just for the moment when they

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.480
were just like oh

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.919
yeah i don't know what to be doing is

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.120
this thing working i'm like [ __ ] that's

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.400
what we do shut up

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.679

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.679
[ __ ]

00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:35.279
they probably listened in fact i bet

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:37.039
they did they probably did i bet

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:38.400
at least one of them was like what's all

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.080
this hubbub about about this damn i'm

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.720
gonna watch this

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.400
they probably we probably inspired them

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.400
i bet barack obama saw that clip

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.240
yeah and was like dude that [ __ ] was

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.919
really funny i wonder if he did

00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:50.400
dude oh i wonder who's in a briefing

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.200
they were telling

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.039
mr president you need to see this this

00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:54.960
is fantastic actually trump dog was in

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.520
office

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.120
yeah the dog probably didn't watch it

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.799
brock and brock probably saw it brock

00:26:58.799 --> 00:26:59.840
saw it but dude the

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.440
they talk about the time that when they

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.559
talk about the time they met they're

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:03.120
like

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.159
you're kind of shy and i like that about

00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:06.400
you

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.240
we talked and like you know bruce

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.600
springsteen says something like

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.360
when you're an outsider you gotta speak

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.039
your voice when you're an outsider and

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:16.880
you get paid hundreds of thousands to

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.760
perform for

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.399
thousands of people that love you man

00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:21.760
it's tough being an outsider he was

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.600
talking about way back when

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.760
back when he was 17 when he was 17 dude

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.039
he had something the world needed to

00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:28.880
hear him say and he's like you got to be

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.360
you got to be kind of gonna have an ego

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.799
and barack obama's like yeah you mean

00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:34.000
like a megalomaniac

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.200
to think the world needs to hear what

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.159
you have to say he said that yeah oh man

00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:40.080
barack's got the jokes dude brock was

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.240
like he's like well like a megalomaniac

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.279
basically because they're both talking

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:44.720
about how they just were burning with

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.679
desire

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:47.360
to like let the world hear what they had

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.480
to say do you remember that song

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.640
megalomaniac by incubus yes

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.960
dude step down that's what i like that's

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.840
all

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.520
that's all i can think about whenever i

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.360
hear that word all i think about is

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.000
yankee basically

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.679
this song remember when that's when you

00:27:59.679 --> 00:28:01.200
did it yeah

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.640
wasn't that nice when the protests were

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.799
just like incubus being like you're a

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.399
[ __ ] megalomaniac yeah

00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:08.000
people were pissed at like even then i

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.679
was like shut the [ __ ] up

00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:11.039
i remember being a kid and hearing that

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:12.880
me like shut the [ __ ] up

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.120
i didn't like yeah i hear it was always

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.000
phony to me

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.320
yeah votely political comedies or comedy

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.559
just like art is kind of tough

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:24.720
it's like i don't agree with this yeah

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.840
but yeah the uh yeah i remember i didn't

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.760
like george bush when i was younger

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.600
i was fully like this guy is [ __ ]

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.520
doing bad stuff really yeah i thought he

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.279
was doing like really evil stuff

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:36.880
that was my feeling on it at the time

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.720
really and i i've watched everyone being

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.279
like

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:41.120
this is [ __ ] the government's lying

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.399
and i was like remember being like all

00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:43.360
right here we go

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.520
and then dude now you have like berkeley

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.960
students at berkeley

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.520
getting a professor fired who is like

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.159
teaching

00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:52.480
propaganda saying like he was teaching

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.840
people how to recognize corporate and

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.039
government propaganda

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:56.320
why is he getting fired cause you

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.320
spewing [ __ ] hate dude you can't go

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.440
against corporate

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.760
giants and say they're propagandizing us

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.360
students were like this is dangerous

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.720
i think because he touched on some of

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.399
the kovitz stuff how countries used it

00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:07.520
to their advantage

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.440
and they were like [ __ ] the students

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.960
our freedom fighters

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.399
of this country were like get them out

00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:13.360
of here the guy's been teaching it for

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.159
30 years

00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:16.880
i think spug was telling me this that's

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.360
no good

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.799
that's a weird flip dude i remember

00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:20.559
being a youngster and being like

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:22.240
yeah you think george bush the war

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.600
criminal be like that's cool no i

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.240
remember

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.679
supporting him more because my

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:26.960
classmates felt that way because he

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.919
thought he's a war criminal they were

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:29.360
like he's a piece of [ __ ] and i was like

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:29.840
w

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.320
rules w [ __ ] i had that trump in me

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.600
from day one where everyone was like

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.159
trump's a

00:29:34.159 --> 00:29:35.840
[ __ ] piece of [ __ ] i was like trump's

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.440
the best you were

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.840
you were practicing i was who would have

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.120
thought and then when everyone was like

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.200
barack obama is king i'm like i hate him

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.279
you guys are being gay about this well

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:49.039
they they threw a jab at uh

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:50.559
brock hussein pretty hard and i think

00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:51.840
that was the adam curtis thing when they

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.279
talk about the

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:54.880
shift of wealth like a trillion dollar

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.880
shift of wealth leaving the lower class

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.320
to the uh elites during that time

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.640
that's pretty bad he helped the elites i

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.000
think so i mean that was a whole that

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.960
was a whole problem i know

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.039
that was a whole package deal they took

00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:08.880
out the factories

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.399
that's why me and bruce are outsiders

00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:12.080
dude that's why i had to work at those

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.600
shitty jobs dude they destroyed the

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.960
factories

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.360
i was just a boy dude there was one

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.840
there's one point where him and uh so

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.840
they're talking about their friendship

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.600
and you know that's like brock was like

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.200
well you know yeah

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.520
egoic megalomaniac they're like yeah but

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.480
that's what you do you

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.240
you take your megalomania and just

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.080
hollow yourself out over time and blah

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.600
blah and you just become for the [ __ ]

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.480
people and they're like yeah that's what

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.840
we obviously did and i'm like

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.600
yeah obviously that's what we all did

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.200
but the uh it's really going on but

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.159
either way it was like something you

00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:43.520
would hear that you're like yeah okay

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.279
and then brock is like that's why that's

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:46.640
why i want to be friends cause you just

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.159
hit me with like that deep stuff and

00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:49.520
like we gotta hang out

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.880
he's like so we're in the white house

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.399
yeah i wonder if he would still feel

00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:53.200
that way if

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.600
bruce didn't if if bruce wasn't world

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.640
famous

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.159
if he just saw a guy playing guitar and

00:30:58.159 --> 00:30:59.919
was like whoa that guy's deep that's why

00:30:59.919 --> 00:31:00.559
i like him

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:02.880
yeah yeah it is it's very circle jerky

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.600
in that regard

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.440
it is and then michelle wanted us to

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.200
hang out because you know how you're

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.880
you own your mistakes in your marriage

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.559
and i could learn just like it's just

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:12.000
like cheesy office dude [ __ ]

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.240

in this town yeah you don't pay for come

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.800
here that's a really shitty thing they

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.599
were doing

00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:07.200
i i hope they stopped doing it because

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.280
that's like that crime

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.240
is not even close to that punishment no

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.920
that's like medieval stock stuff

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.000
it's ultimate that's exactly what it is

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.760
i think the the problem they were having

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.560
was like

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.800
the sex trafficking stuff sort of like

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.079
and i think they were like we gotta take

00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:23.760
it to these john's real hard

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.720
that was the thing they used to just

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.040
like back in the good old days

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.040
they would grab the girls and just bump

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.400
them into a battery the girls

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.160
[ __ ] [ __ ] and then that became

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.680
politically kind of you know well that

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.800
was actually wrong

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.319
i know i don't know if the pc police had

00:44:38.319 --> 00:44:39.440
anything to do with this one

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.760
no i think i think they yeah true they

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.119
were like there was that whole free the

00:44:43.119 --> 00:44:44.319
sex worker movement where they're like

00:44:44.319 --> 00:44:45.680
no the girls are the victims they're

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.560

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.040
of cheating

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.680
it's even better it's discreet that your

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.319
wife should

00:46:30.319 --> 00:46:32.000
somewhat understand that way they're not

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.599
like you don't have like a girl a side

00:46:33.599 --> 00:46:35.200
girlfriend and stuff that that's just a

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.400
[ __ ] ticking time bomb

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.800
of course it is you want a professional

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.599
you show up

00:46:39.599 --> 00:46:40.960
you need to get milked out of a table

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.800
yeah dude does it get milked out of a

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.359
table

00:46:43.359 --> 00:46:45.200
there should be some leeway to that

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.720
there should be protocol where it's like

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.000
it should be honestly

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.760
we shouldn't medicalize it where it's

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.280
not even like a sex thing it's

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.640
just getting milked yeah just have it

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.480

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.359
practitioners

or whoever at like urgent care i mean

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.319

nurse practitioner she's gonna milk you

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.640
i think they should it should that

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.760
should be covered under a med that

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.359
should be decriminalized to be honest

00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:07.520
not even decriminalized sex work should

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.720
be fully medicalized

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.800
that'd be nice going into urgent care

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.760

like one of those guys who like go to

00:47:38.319 --> 00:47:40.160

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.839

and that would be tight if you got your

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.200
physical then they were just kind of

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.079
like oh

00:48:04.079 --> 00:48:05.760

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.599
be the uh the only thing though the

00:48:07.599 --> 00:48:08.319
catch

00:48:08.319 --> 00:48:09.839
would be it would be whoever was on

00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:12.480

so there was some boys in that small

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.839
town were getting rowdy and that's when

00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:29.280
bruce went up the day after there was

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.880
like there was riots and [ __ ] and bruce

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.079
you know he saw some of his boys he's

00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:33.760
also strumming that he wore all

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.480
dungarees

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.240
people younger yeah that was a bandana

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.760
flag

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.760
yeah ripped asleep immediately he was

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.040
like i'm not having that i got to fix

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:41.359
this

00:54:41.359 --> 00:54:42.799
but he said he did he was trying to talk

00:54:42.799 --> 00:54:43.839
to some of his black friends and they

00:54:43.839 --> 00:54:44.400
were like

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.839
not today bruce he was like i understand

00:54:47.839 --> 00:54:51.040
i wouldn't understand yeah well he uh

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:53.119
what he was saying he was like the best

00:54:53.119 --> 00:54:54.640
way for us to get past this is

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.599
for us not to talk yeah that's the best

00:54:57.599 --> 00:54:58.880
way to solve these problems

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.799
for us to understand we can't talk it

00:55:00.799 --> 00:55:02.559
was so funny because brock was like

00:55:02.559 --> 00:55:04.400
well that was him leaving the door open

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.319
but just saying like not right now

00:55:06.319 --> 00:55:07.680
yeah it's good i think it's important

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.760
for guys like barack hussein obama to

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.200
speak for the entire black community

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:14.799
for sure yeah but yeah dude it was uh

00:55:14.799 --> 00:55:16.319
it was weird it was he was talking about

00:55:16.319 --> 00:55:17.920
that but he did say

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.160
i think he was talking about how he's

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.680
like you know my family is a bunch of

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.160
rednecks but i love him he's like

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.720
i love them they're the people i love

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:27.200
they're

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.319
small town folks they ain't perfect but

00:55:30.319 --> 00:55:32.400
they're the people i love

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.000
it's like so maybe he still maybe maybe

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.440
he loves trump

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.280
bruce springsteen might [ __ ] love

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.960
trump

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.440
i doubt it though yeah definitely not

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.400
yeah

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.640
trust him he might be he might be deep

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.319
undercover yeah

00:55:46.319 --> 00:55:47.920

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.960
about four feet

up to my height sorry babe yeah i told

00:58:24.799 --> 00:58:26.000
you before dude if you fight with a girl

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.760
it's your fault

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.920
that is true still holding it down like

00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:31.119
that i'm more of a

00:58:31.119 --> 00:58:32.480
feminist in that i believe that they're

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.559
equals and we can talk to them as equals

00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:36.240
but i do need to come along the line of

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:37.839
pure misogyny where it's like if i'm in

00:58:37.839 --> 00:58:39.680
a fight with them it's totally my fault

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.119
if you're arguing and yelling yeah yeah

00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:42.300
it's like fighting with a four-year-old

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:45.119
[Laughter]

00:58:45.119 --> 00:58:47.040
now as soon as the voice is raised this

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.720
only came from just

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.960
i would say a coveted length of meta of

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.640
a strict meditation

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.200
as soon as i catch the when as soon as i

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.720
start hearing loudness it just goes like

00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:58.400
this

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.000
we can't do this right now oh that's

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.920
actually gonna be that's gonna backfire

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:02.319
yeah

00:59:02.319 --> 00:59:04.160
women do not like daddy you need to cool

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.640
the fight true

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.040
that is true that's true true until you

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.160
until you bring it to them they're

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.599
sitting there squawking and then you

00:59:11.599 --> 00:59:12.799

e.t kind of looked like a cartoon to me

01:07:17.359 --> 01:07:18.480
i remember just watching it and being

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:18.799
like

01:07:18.799 --> 01:07:20.640
this sounds like a [ __ ] cartoon i

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.000
just went home and just like

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.480
crawled into my bed and i was like yeah

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.760

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.240
i gotta hide and saw the dark knight oh

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.039
that was pretty sick

01:07:29.039 --> 01:07:30.880
so opening scene was like an explosion

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.559
for some reason like uh

01:07:32.559 --> 01:07:33.839
because one that's how it started was

01:07:33.839 --> 01:07:37.520
like a purple explosion

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.079
and then word of the shooting happened

01:07:40.079 --> 01:07:42.319
and i was like oh really

01:07:42.319 --> 01:07:44.640
it was like the night that happened oh

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.760
as the people were like looking at their

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.280
phones it was like a massive shooting

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.680
and i was like

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.760
i started thinking of dying in a movie

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.680
theater like how [ __ ] up that would be

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.520
yeah like a tear because that kid had

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.720
like smoke

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.559
did he really yeah i think he joked i

01:07:58.559 --> 01:08:00.240
think he was wearing a gas mask

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.359
he like tear gassed the room yeah

01:08:03.359 --> 01:08:05.920
and then started shooting oh and people

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.359
were like

01:08:07.359 --> 01:08:09.039
yeah you can't get out he's standing at

01:08:09.039 --> 01:08:10.880
the exit yeah there's not many exits in

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.839
there yeah

01:08:11.839 --> 01:08:13.839
damn what i was just thinking of how

01:08:13.839 --> 01:08:15.359
like horrible that in the middle of a

01:08:15.359 --> 01:08:15.839
movie

01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:18.239
do you think he joker laughed dead ass i

01:08:18.239 --> 01:08:19.520
bet he did being dead

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.799
he must have you think he was like

01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:23.120
although this was truthfully this was

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.960
opening night this was like midnight

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.239
premiere so he didn't even get to see

01:08:26.239 --> 01:08:28.000
how sick the joker actually was

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.319
true i wonder if he got to watch it in

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:31.679
prison

01:08:31.679 --> 01:08:33.040

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.880
they hooked him up

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.239

debut

01:08:45.199 --> 01:08:46.799
pretty bad because i remember going to

01:08:46.799 --> 01:08:48.000
the movie after that and being a little

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.040
like

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.120

universe

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.279

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:56.799
this might have been marvel that could

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:58.159
have been i might have been stanley

01:08:58.159 --> 01:09:01.440
stark yeah it could have been robert

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:04.080
downey jr

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.319
yeah he was a bit of a renegade true

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:10.560
i think his vices were [ __ ] and drugs

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.279
