in front of me in the line to the point

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.479
where i leaned over and i was like hey

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:43.519

yeah i had a friend who like

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.640
legitimately confided to me he's like i

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.120
don't trust fat people he's like they're

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.200

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.279
like i mean spilling over and under an

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:57.360
armrest it's a problem it's an issue

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.720
what's the health thing everyone's like

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.880
oh that's a health condition it's like

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.120
dude i'm pretty sure if i isolated you

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.880
and watched and was like nope nope nope

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.200
you would lose like 400 pounds yeah

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.320
there's always wonder about that because

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.080
people say i knew a guy he was a machine

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.600
operator and he was like my [ __ ]

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.040
thyroid we'd always be like dude you got

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.560
fat as [ __ ] and he's like i have a

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.080
[ __ ] diver condition [ __ ] you and

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.880
every day i'm like but you eat

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.480
cheesesteaks every day

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.839
cheese sticks every day that's pretty

00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:22.399
thyroid conditioner

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:24.240
yeah you just want to munch there there

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.240
is a i think if someone's within your

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.480
seat space in in air you're allowed to

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.560
pinch whatever you want i

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.160
you could have been like

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
i was shifting and

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.519
i was grumbling the whole time i was

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.600

it was crazy

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.360
and i was like if this plane goes down

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.360
at least she goes down too right there

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.640

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.160
saved you though

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.360
you could ride her

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.760
if that [ __ ] engine shut out she

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.959
would have leveled the plane that would

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:05.200
be like man sit on that side

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.120

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.160
know it was

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.079
it was my weakness that i was judging

00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:04.399
her as aggressively as i was yeah i was

00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:06.800
mad at her yeah kind of fun to do like

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.959
puppets with a fat person's roles though

00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:10.639

00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:52.880
hard to sleep like first off it takes a

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.480
long ass time to like get your sleep

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.320
schedule used to someone else's and then

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.839
like even then

00:14:57.839 --> 00:15:00.000

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.839
time you need my sleep you have no idea

00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:05.440
what i'm up against

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.360
i have a lady who screams in her sleep

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.440
she's night terrors she's an afghanistan

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.360
god yeah i don't know what else she

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.519
murdered those plans

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:15.040
i don't know what happened to her but

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.880
it's terrifying

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.720
and then i get mad yeah because i can't

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.959

00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:22.800
would you shut up

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.959
just you know what i mean it's a madness

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:26.800
you can possibly be getting woken up

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.040
scared i'm fuming yeah now i'm feeling

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.240
having twice a night have her take

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.600
magnesium

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.000
magnesium really helps you sleep you

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.199
take that's the problem she's taking

00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:37.759
sleeping stuff what mello take like a

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:40.000
melatonin like a benadryl or something

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.440
yeah but sometimes that'll [ __ ] you [ __ ]

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.759
them up yeah tell me man i'm girls the

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:46.240
girls love pills yeah man true the

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.320
ladies love pills are for girls yeah for

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.279
sure

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:50.720
do you guys take antidepressants or

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.959
anything

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.399
dude you want to know something sad

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:56.160
about antidepressants i was researching

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.160
them the other day

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.079
brain plasticity or some [ __ ] that was

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:02.480
no it was actually they so they why do

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.240
you take them yeah i take a thing for

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.920
anxiety yeah nice do you really what do

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.399
you take i take back soya okay yeah so

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:09.839
i've read the essay

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:12.160
yeah i know right the ssris

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.279
so what happened a lot of people gain

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:14.560
weight on them and everyone i was like

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.160
trying to understand the mechanism of

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.079
weight gain from antidepressants and

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:19.199
apparently

00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:21.440
i think like glucose is like a precursor

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.519
to forming serotonin so you have people

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:24.720
who are like trying to you know they

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.759
don't even realize they're doing this

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:27.040
but their body starts being like we need

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.240
more sugar we need more so they're just

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.759
like eating sugar and trying to make

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:31.360
their brain make happy chemicals and

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.120
it's like god it's so [ __ ] sad that

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.959
is depressing yeah yeah

00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:39.040
no i like uh i don't even need it as

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.399
much anymore because i got married it

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.639
was just like when i would go on dates i

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:43.839
would like

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:45.360
sometimes i'd have panic attacks like

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.880
sometimes i'd be fine

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.480
but like other times i don't even like

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.920
you'd freak out all day yeah freak out

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.079
on dates like or like actually you know

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:53.920
like i would stress vomit like eminem

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.759
and eight mile or what like and the main

00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:56.800
thing was

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.720
before a day or even on a date sometimes

00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.920
like pardon me and go to the bathroom

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.600
and throw up exactly yeah that's the

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.000
thing is the key you can't throw up in

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.280
front of a girl i didn't she's never

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.039
gonna [ __ ] you so you have to like

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:08.799
excuse me growing up before a day and

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:09.839
then he meets the girl and she's like

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.170
yeah i live in bush

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:15.199
[Laughter]

00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:17.760
oh that's cool

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.520
but yeah that water in my mouth yeah

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.880
like sometimes i would like arrive at a

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.400
day and be able to watch broad city

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.120
and that's the worst it's like

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.799
there's no real like logic to it but in

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:30.400
the back of your head you're like okay

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.919

like these people you know it's it

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.200
doesn't make any sense logically but i

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.880
would like occasionally i'd like show up

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.080

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:54.880
like this

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.799
bad you're just like it's like a [ __ ]

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:58.160
it's like in baseball where you cheat

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.840
the fastball they like start swinging

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.200
before they throw it you just get loaded

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.960
for the day is there a thought process

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.799
behind it or were you just like there

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:06.559
was like yeah like i mean

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:08.720
it's it's not really like logical where

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.720
it's like my heart starts going and then

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.880
there's like a i feel nauseous and you

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.559
know nervous but like

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:16.400
in terms of like what i'm thinking in my

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.080
mind

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.919

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:21.039
tried that once because you know

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:22.400
something about me i mean do you

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.640
prematurely ejaculate oh no no i never

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.320
had that problem yeah but that would be

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.559
uh me neither yes

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:30.640
never happened or i guess no it never it

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.720
happened but what is sick to like just

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.160
like be puking on dates and finally

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.520
getting [ __ ] and just absolutely

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.050
shredding her [ __ ]

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.240
[Laughter]

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.440

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.120
able to experience this

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.919

00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:47.600

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.039

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.159
yeah magnesium

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.919
so yeah we talked about soil sign

00:27:11.919 --> 00:27:13.120
therapy and how it works for people who

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.720
are like about to die

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.159
he said it takes that you guys have a

00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:18.000
cloud of death around you and it just

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.559
[ __ ] yeah it moves away you feeling

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.640
like you might die kind of sucks

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.480
oh like knowing you're going to though

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.399
yeah that's like they're like no you are

00:27:26.399 --> 00:27:27.520
and you're just like you're hanging with

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.440
your kids like i'm gonna [ __ ] die

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.720
yeah [ __ ] yeah kind of a fl it flies in

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.480
the face of the ssri model because

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.080
they're saying they've got to like

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.520
alter your brain chemicals you have like

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.880
one crazy experience and you're like

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.000

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.320
saying like ecstasy treats ptsd and i

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.480
know like uh psilocybin and lsd and

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.679
stuff have been

00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:49.279
good for addiction and and i guess that

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:51.039
kind of stuff when you're like

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.159

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:53.360
talking about the other one is like

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.799
that's where all mental problems come

00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:56.799

00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:59.120
lot of them this denial of death

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.200

really clever call back to like you and

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:51.760
the rollerblader and like that period of

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.760
time goes by and you go oh yeah i was

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.440
just doing some real meta stuff right

00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:00.240
media and just go along with whatever i

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.320

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.399
protecting my family dude i don't want

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:05.440
them to get some weird experimental

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.960
vaccine in a year from now be like

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.480
[ __ ] up like damn i wish i [ __ ] put

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.679
my foot down

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.440
that's just me

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.560
how long do you think if there's

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:18.399
how long what oh if there's like

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:19.760
negative effects how long do you think

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.879
it'll be

00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:22.800
for the vaccine yeah i don't know dude i

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.000
don't know anything about it you know i

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.679
don't know i'm just like

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:26.960
chilling i'm in the pocket dude you just

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.200
gotta count from when bob odenkirk got

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.159
his and that's when it'll hit you

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:34.079
his was vaccine right well he got a

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:36.879
heart attack but we have

00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:40.000
no idea what caused it yeah yeah exactly

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.119
i'm just chilling dude i don't know i

00:34:41.119 --> 00:34:42.879
don't know anything i'm just like

00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:44.560
you know the way they're going if they

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.639
were to be like hey tonight on the news

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:48.079
we're gonna let these two people debate

00:34:48.079 --> 00:34:49.839
it out i'd be like oh this is sweet yeah

00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:50.960
but dude it's the way they're going

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.320
about it's creepy as [ __ ] dude that's

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.399
how like robert f kennedy jr convinced

00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:56.720
me to like for a time be like anti-vaxx

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.480
because he's like oh it with a [ __ ] up

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.640
voice like uh i will debate any of these

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.040
scientists and they always say no and

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.640
i'm like why won't they debate him wait

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.160
wait he's a kennedy come on you got a

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.839
debate it's kind of the same mentality

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.280
the press had with trump where they were

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.040
like even if he does something good it's

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.680
our obligation to the public to

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.280
shut this down

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.640
you know and i think that's how they

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.240
feel about the vaccines yeah dude

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.320
they're like we're obligated

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.400
to never question right well it also

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.920
gives people then you just like before i

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.040
was like yes i interrupt for all you

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.160
know all those things you got to get but

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.359
then you start like people are you're

00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:28.560
[ __ ] anti-vaxxer and you start

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.000
talking people who are anti-vaxxers and

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.960
it's like they're like dude you know

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.280
they give when the kids like five hours

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.520
old they get a hepatitis yeah shot and

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.720
that's like

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.560
why well that's the thing like you know

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.599
[ __ ] i

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:42.079
uh the rfk junior argument and that's

00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:43.920
anti-vaccine like this kind of [ __ ] can

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.599
get you in trouble with youtube or

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:48.640
whatever so i want to be careful but uh

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.560
but we'd much rather go back to audio

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.400
yeah

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.160
but he dude that's weird well he points

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.320
out that like there's some like reagan

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.680
law and like i don't know 86 or 87

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.160
which um gave the vaccine companies this

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.040
like

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.440
total immunity so there's like a special

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.040
fund that's set up you can't actually

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.400
sue the vax companies you go to this

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.000
thing and he says like the modern

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.480
schedule kind of comes in around like i

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.880
forget if it's 86 or 88 99 but this

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.320
point is like essentially when you look

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.760
at you know autism and all these [ __ ]

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.680
up things it all really starts like 1989

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.720
people born 1989 and after and you know

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.400
people say oh they can diagnose it

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.640
better or whatever but it it does seem

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.560
like they're giving kids a lot more

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.320
shots than they used to and you know

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.920
maybe that's something to do with it but

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.480
so apparently i'm not a scientist yeah

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.839
but maybe they should debate robert f

00:36:37.839 --> 00:36:40.400
kennedy jr there was 27 yeah [ __ ] there

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.200
was

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.960
yeah vaccine there was 20 there was

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.680
about 27 i think not a vaccine [ __ ]

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.599
before before that before that just

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:50.160
saying i am dude before they did they

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.760
gave him immunity from like you can't

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.040
sue them it's like what the [ __ ]

00:37:07.839 --> 00:37:09.520
all i'm saying is dude my body my choice

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.280
dude you think people would [ __ ]

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.119
recognize it and you're pro-choice too a

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:14.640
big pro choice dude

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.760
it's kind of funny i think it's i think

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.040
it's evil that women kill babies but

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.320
they can do that if they want i think

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.359
it's [ __ ] up that they would kill a

00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:22.960
beautiful baby but yeah they can

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.400
yeah what if it's going to look like

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.079
boobs kid

00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:27.680
i mean that's on them yeah they want to

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.920
kill their baby and become [ __ ]

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.079
yeah yeah can't bring a baby in a world

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:34.839
where they have to get 70 vaccines

00:37:34.839 --> 00:37:36.720
true but do you think that we would be

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.160
kind of out of the woods with covet if

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.160
more people were vaccinated

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.680
i mean what's defined out of the woods

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.560
five people a week dying in a state um

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.400
is it yeah i mean if that's fine yeah

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.160
sure it's not yeah i mean more less

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.839
people would die of covid and then you'd

00:37:49.839 --> 00:37:51.680
have more adverse reactions people are

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.599
going to adverse reactions yeah choices

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:55.680
up to the people yeah choices up to the

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.640
[ __ ] people that's what i'm

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.400
saying yeah do what you want protect

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.760
yourself dude and if science comes out

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.119
being like actually

00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:03.440
it's like way more okay cool sign me up

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.040
but for now i'm like yeah

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.560
that's kind of funny my my wife is

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.839
brazilian and she like hit me oh well

00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:10.640
she

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.440
hit me with this thing

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
you [ __ ] had a cia overthrow

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.800
uh

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.240
oh yeah so she hit me with this thing

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.680
like you know i don't trust american

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.680
vaccines like if i'm not gonna take any

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.280
american vaccines if we get our kids

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.280
vaccinated we go to brazil and i'm like

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.400
my head at the time was like you're

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.359
[ __ ] [ __ ] what and it's like and

00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:33.200
then i watch like these rfk junior

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.680
youtube videos like hell yeah yeah have

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.520
you been in brazil yeah yeah brazil is

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.880
beautiful so sick yeah my uh my brother

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.720
uh has

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.359
he's got autism and uh he wasn't really

00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:47.040
born like he was like a normal kind of

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.960
healthy baby you got hit with it i don't

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.480
know but i just remember him i even

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.640
remember him as a baby like talking and

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.640
saying words and stuff and then i think

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.160
when he was two he just kind of like

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.920
shut down i'm not saying it's vaccines

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.119
or anything right i'm just saying he

00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:00.400
wasn't born with

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.560
any kind of disability i think they paid

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.800
out again yeah obviously looking after

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.320
yourself i think gardasil was the one

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.839
they were fighting i think they had

00:39:07.839 --> 00:39:10.160
actually paid out for all i mean i could

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.760
be getting misinformed look into it for

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.359
yourself yes so yeah i mean you know

00:39:13.359 --> 00:39:15.200
what i mean it's like the problem is is

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.160
it's like

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.680
this whole thing became a thing where

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.800
it's like oh you're one of those blah

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.040
blah dude i got all my [ __ ] things if

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.800
i had known more maybe i [ __ ]

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.320
wouldn't have well like who has time to

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.800
research this [ __ ] though nobody no yeah

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.160
well some people now well now that a lot

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.320
of people have boss yeah

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.839
my cousin went through and just did just

00:39:31.839 --> 00:39:34.079
the numbers dude and he was like it's

00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:35.359
you know he's like it's just not that

00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:36.800
but he'll also concede he was like you

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.640
know a lot of people go like it's not

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.480
killing anyone it's like no there's the

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.079
data's in from the hospitals if you're

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:43.760
not vaccinated you are more likely to

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.680
die from covet that's fine

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.960

a trans phase yeah

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.319

00:40:38.319 --> 00:40:40.079
they're going to hate the jocks

00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:41.920

or it's like euphoria where the the

00:40:50.079 --> 00:40:52.480
[ __ ]

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.359
there's another one where the best uh

00:40:55.359 --> 00:40:56.800

kids show

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.119
first of all go ahead there was a it was

00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:05.359
just a dude who was like a gay black guy

00:41:05.359 --> 00:41:06.960
that was like the best captain of the

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.800
water polo oh yeah yeah

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.880

you're talk i've heard about that before

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.560
yeah all dude there's something i've

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:17.839
noticed too about women's psychology

00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:20.640
where they love high school dramas

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.160
a lot like older women will watch high

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.079
school dramas like going in to like like

00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:25.920
gilmore girls

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.280
that was like maine one of the main

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.560
sublimes was like high school we all

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.040
liked it for a while in america

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.880
every movie was like a high school drama

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.720
true yeah you know yeah coming they were

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.119
like big movies like blockbuster movies

00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:39.599
were like she's all that yeah i guess

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:40.880
you're right yeah i guess you're right

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.040
it's good it's kind of weird i like it i

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.800
like a good high school flick i don't

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.319
know man i've seen a lot it's not just

00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:47.520
you know it's not just my faith i know a

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.960
lot of women who just watch like high

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.359
school love stories

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:52.880
strange do you like high school love

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.000
stories not really no i mean

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.680
i'm trying to think of like

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.680
it's just like you can't really watch

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.800
them because they're all the actors are

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.240
all in their like mid-20s it's just kind

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.000
of [ __ ] weird that's what [ __ ] you

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.240
up is they put these goddamn hot kids on

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.760
there right yeah this hot 20 year old

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.520
and she's like i'm in middle school yeah

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.240
like

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.839
why are you making me get turned on yeah

00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:13.200
grease was the only movie that did it

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.640
right just take a bunch of four years

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.240
but uh dev and i watched never been

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.520
kissed i was just thinking that yeah

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.440
it's wild yeah but never been kissed uh

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.800
it's with drew barrymore she like goes

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.079
back down he's like a reporter that's

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:25.440
like i'm going undercover and goes out

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.280
to high school to make out with people i

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.119
think our kids i think that's the

00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:30.560
fantasy i think she nailed it on the

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.079
writer no but it really doesn't hold up

00:42:32.079 --> 00:42:33.440
and it's really a bad movie because the

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.599
prince the premise is like don't we all

00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:37.119
want to go back to high school and be

00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:38.480
cool again

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.200
no yeah i like my life now i gotta i

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.440
gotta kind of i got a honda hrv

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.119
i do wish the dorks

00:42:45.119 --> 00:42:46.880
dorks in our country

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.640
yeah you like it yeah i love it yeah

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.079
guys don't try to fake a friendship now

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.560
don't try to bond over crvs that we're

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.240
dead dude uh

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:56.960
yeah the true this is the thickness it

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.079
is like the dead non-dad divide we we

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:02.640
did re reset the seating

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.760
yeah

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.920
so i think we do need the dorks to go

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.240
back to having the i wish i could redeem

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.319
myself in high school quality now

00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:13.040
they've all been indoctrinated with all

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.400
the people that were cool in high school

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.800
are losers you're the cool one

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.319
they need to remember

00:43:18.319 --> 00:43:20.400
i was cool right yeah they need to

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.839
remember the captain of the high school

00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:24.960
football team rules

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.920
but right kind of the premise of uh 21

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.280
jumpers the captain of the high school

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.440
football team is still cool that is true

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.119
that no that's true and you'll never

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:34.960
stop and the goth kids will always be

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.960
dorks they can write as many articles as

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.040
they want if i see them they're getting

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.360
a wedge

and now they're like being gay it's cool

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.760
i'm like it's not

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.319
the more you know

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.280
i mean to be fair

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.560
there would be no gay people if it

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.640
wasn't for us hard-working heterosexuals

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.240

heating never worked so that was a

00:48:08.559 --> 00:48:10.079
little annoying so you were like we need

00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:10.920
to get rid of israel

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.680

00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:17.200
and you you the cia is heavy with israel

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.040
right yeah they're pretty close yeah

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.720
they're pals

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.400
they they there's some documentary they

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.920
got mad at each other because they did

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.839
the cia put together a computer virus

00:48:25.839 --> 00:48:27.680
called stuxnet which they used to like

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.000
[ __ ] up the iranian centrifuges like

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.359

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:47.119
[Laughter]

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:49.599
yeah yeah so the ci built this virus and

00:48:49.599 --> 00:48:51.839
then they were like being very limited

00:48:51.839 --> 00:48:52.960
with it and then they shared it with the

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.200
israelis and the israelis just like ran

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.960
it all over the place

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.400
and uh yeah

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.240

00:49:05.359 --> 00:49:06.160
uh

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.720
but yeah it's

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.920
it's um

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.000

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.119
where like the u.s when they invaded

oh no

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.880
we should start bashing sponsors and

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.160
have them do a reverse thing where they

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.240
pay us to just stop six yeah we should

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.599
that's smart yeah just leave us that's

01:01:31.599 --> 01:01:32.880

we've cracked the code if you leave the

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.520
house yeah you tear it up

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.799
like she's he's never coming back

01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:04.400
they immediately go through the trash

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.720
and start eating

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.240
billy uh billy has a good theory that

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.359
they're forever a lot they're eighth

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.799
grade they're just locked in eighth

01:07:10.799 --> 01:07:12.160
grade forever

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.599
yeah that's when puberty hits they get

01:07:13.599 --> 01:07:15.920
locked yeah they lock up it's like in

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.599
his dark materials they get their damon

01:07:17.599 --> 01:07:18.960
they get like their damon chooses them

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.559
at like a certain time

01:07:20.559 --> 01:07:22.079
and that's it for life it's so

01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:23.200
frustrating too because you know when

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.200
you're a guy you can like stay anywhere

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.160
you stay in like a six dollar night

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.920
and enjoy it have a good time you know

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.839
make the most of it yeah you use the

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:33.839
shitty little computer on the

01:07:33.839 --> 01:07:35.200
you know for the

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.799
go on the internet or whatever it is you

01:07:36.799 --> 01:07:38.400
know what i posted on twitter that uh

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.240
that room that kanye was staring in to

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.599
record the album that is actually the

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:43.760
ideal male living space like if i didn't

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.839
have a woman to impress or try i wasn't

01:07:45.839 --> 01:07:47.599
trying to get posted i would just live

01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:50.000
in like that like basically

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.039
bed

01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:53.280
closet i don't know some weights maybe

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.520
some books a window you're good yeah

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.480
prison yeah prison it's perfect hey we

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.280
should go to prison and prison

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.559
i would make an excellent prisoner

01:08:02.559 --> 01:08:04.799
prison would be good if there was no

01:08:04.799 --> 01:08:06.640
rape yeah if everybody gets if we stuck

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:11.480
together if all of us if guys like us

01:08:21.759 --> 01:08:23.120
my friend went to jail he said there's a

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.960
lot of guys stink in jail really he was

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.560
a decent basketball player he was like a

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.159
lot of the guys stink they're hacking

01:08:28.159 --> 01:08:30.159
you really he's like they probably foul

01:08:30.159 --> 01:08:32.000
the [ __ ] yeah they're not he was like

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.679
these are not where he's like every now

01:08:33.679 --> 01:08:34.880
and again you'll hear a guy who's like

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.400
could have been d1 but he's like when i

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.159
was there it's just these guys i'd like

01:08:38.159 --> 01:08:40.080
to have sean do you think that the cia

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.839
is doing all the prison rape to stop

01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:43.839
guys from going there because if there

01:08:43.839 --> 01:08:45.040
wasn't

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.279
guys would just go to prison right yeah

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:49.199
that would be a nice state funded yeah

01:08:49.199 --> 01:08:51.359
it'd be guy heaven guys working out and

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:52.960
having fun together

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.400
and if you got tvs in there and you

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.839
could all laugh at which things together

01:08:55.839 --> 01:08:56.880
they don't have weights in prison

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.880

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.120
boom yeah

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.440
my dad claims my dad claims to know a

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.440
guy who got robbed he had a bar

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.360
in chester pennsylvania it's rough town

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.040
and he got robbed a lot of times he it

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.320
was like i think his third time he had

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.080
robbed he's like no more he kept the gun

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.000
under the bar yeah where he was at and

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.440
they were like they was getting robbed

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.360
again and he took the money and he's

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.800
my dad claims he went like that and

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.080
tossed it up in the air to the guy when

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.280
the guy reached up to check it he

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.520
grabbed the gun and just went oh i just

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.600
[ __ ] shot him yeah so it's a little

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.880
trick if you're getting mugged just toss

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.920
your wallet up in the air and they go to

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.360
catch it just

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.520
then get your ass beat hey maker

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.120
it's always like little kids mugging you

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.120
yeah what if they shoot you that way

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.000
because they

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.440
when you then they got it they're gonna

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.960
miss the wallet

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.400
so then you throw the wallet up and if

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.920
they're not looking at the wallet what

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.080
are they what if your sudden movement

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.440
makes them think you have a gun and they

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.719
just shoot you right away yeah that

01:11:10.719 --> 01:11:12.560
could happen like that but a lot of

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.920
people like have you ever had a gun on

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.679
you no you can look at them they look

01:11:15.679 --> 01:11:17.120
some of if they look nervous and you

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.400
know you can kind of you can control the

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.920
situation but the nervous guy might

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.320
[ __ ] buckle you but denzel move but

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.679

the all comedians have the most hope

01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:43.840
yeah i don't understand the confusion

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.840

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.239
the all comedians are on every tv show

01:13:48.239 --> 01:13:50.239

dude they're serving the patriarchy

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.920
that's right yeah that's over the

01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.440
patriarchy it's four corporations

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.280
control ninety percent of the media and

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.560
it's like yeah they go along with the

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.159
vaccine passports and everything else

01:14:04.159 --> 01:14:05.920

vaccine and the government shouldn't

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.159
another thing people seem really

01:14:14.159 --> 01:14:15.920
delighted when people die

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.120

oh what any time you shift into a

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.159
compound afterlife i grew up on a

01:16:28.159 --> 01:16:29.920
compound dude after like one or two

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.520

this is how it's i said after a couple

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.400
generations first generation was

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.800
compound next generation will be like

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.000
yeah because you want to raise your kid

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.320

01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:18.159
little cows or something dude it's just

01:17:18.159 --> 01:17:20.000
like thomas jefferson with your black

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.560
wife out there dude

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.640
dude

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.480
i'm slightly jeffersonian i would say

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.719
for sure in terms of his philosophy

01:17:28.719 --> 01:17:30.560
yeah i think i've said it on here you

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.239

01:17:32.239 --> 01:17:34.880
slaves nice he chose a couple and yeah

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.080
yeah he kept

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:38.000
he emancipated a few minutes like two

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.480
and kept like nine dad's favorites dude

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:42.320
you're [ __ ] dad's favorite you just

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.000
you figure out which kids can cook and

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:44.960
then you're like yeah you're staying a

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.640
slave

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.719
perhaps maybe maybe you just had a bond

01:17:48.719 --> 01:17:50.239
an unshakeable bond with a couple of

01:17:50.239 --> 01:17:51.120
them

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.440

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.719
a lot more high school oh yeah i was

01:18:38.719 --> 01:18:40.239
working that i skipped graduation

01:18:40.239 --> 01:18:41.440
practice because i was working for an

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.239
electrician i would get 60 bucks a day

01:18:44.239 --> 01:18:45.920
nice yeah let's go

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.840
beautiful this is kind of unrelated but

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.000
like i was thinking this recently like

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.760
the best case scenario about like

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.360
talking about like 911 truth and all

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.880
this conspiracy [ __ ] is like just

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.480
somebody from the ci is like all right

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.920
here's a hundred thousand dollars never

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.760
mention 9 11 again yeah yeah and i'd be

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.920
like hell yes dude oh yeah the worst

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.520
case is they [ __ ] kill you and your

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.600
dog and your two kids but the best case

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.920
okay yeah it was like i would think they

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.360
warned you though before i would like

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.360
yeah it's like hey give me the warning

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.880
they seem to be pretty brazen right now

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.920
though they're getting away but you know

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:15.440
dude did you see this one there no it

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.000
wasn't so yeah well i only just heard

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.840
about this there was a guy called philip

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.440
marshall i think i'm getting his name

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.199
right i posted this on twitter but he

01:19:23.199 --> 01:19:25.280
wrote like so he was a he was involved

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.360
with barry seal you know the american

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.080
made the tom cruise movie barry seal was

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.760
like a cocaine trafficker who worked for

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.679
the cia and they were running the

01:19:33.679 --> 01:19:36.159
cocaine to nicaragua and contras and

01:19:36.159 --> 01:19:37.840
running weapons and you know using that

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.760
to pay for the covert war and all that

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.080
so barry seal this was a pilot who

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.239
worked with barry seal and then after 9

01:19:44.239 --> 01:19:46.960
11 he wrote two 9 11 truth books or you

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.960
know 9 11 was an inside job cheney and

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.360
the saudis they all did it and

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.040
apparently he was working on a third one

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.600
but in 2013

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.760
after his second book

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.239
his dog at his home his dog his two

01:20:00.239 --> 01:20:03.520
teenage children and he is shot to death

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:06.239
and the sheriffs in california say this

01:20:06.239 --> 01:20:08.480
is a murder suicide he shot both his

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.040
kids he shot his dog he shot himself and

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.040
like first off that's like already shady

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.600
that this like cia pilot did all that

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.159
[ __ ] after writing 911 truth books but

01:20:18.159 --> 01:20:20.320
then like i was reading apparently the

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.560
scene was or what the detectives claimed

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.880
was the two kids that were both asleep

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.639
when they were shot but they were on

01:20:26.639 --> 01:20:29.760
like an l-shaped bed so that one of them

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.440
would have woken up

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.760
if you shot one of them uh and then the

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.360
detectives just like said no comment

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.600
we're not yeah they're both asleep in

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.000
shot why are they sharing a bed why are

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.280
two teenage kids

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.199
when you write about 911 truth you don't

01:20:43.199 --> 01:20:45.920
have a lot of money

01:20:50.159 --> 01:20:52.000
yeah but they were both asleep when so

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.120
that would imply that there were two

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.360
shooters maybe yeah or a very heavy

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.280
sleeping daughter right or maverick just

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.880

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.320
i like yeah yeah yeah

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.920

bullet time on his children and the dog

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.280
right and he caught the dog he's like

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.880
you know [ __ ] telling anybody this

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.239
the cia is going to train you how to

01:21:10.239 --> 01:21:12.239

to like kill your children what you

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.120

to start with the 911 truth book yeah

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.760
and then you kill your kids and you go

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.639
the cia did it yeah yeah yeah he's like

01:21:28.639 --> 01:21:30.639
how dare you they just

01:21:30.639 --> 01:21:32.639

01:21:32.639 --> 01:21:34.000
that you set them up for a murder they

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.679
didn't commit there's some other god i'm

01:21:35.679 --> 01:21:37.600
spacing on his name but there is some

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.360
guy who's hiding out in [ __ ]

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.960
argentina or one of these south american

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:44.880
countries who claims he has footage of

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:46.719
like vaults

01:21:46.719 --> 01:21:49.040
underneath the world trade center yeah

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.719
they're there yeah yeah yeah

01:21:50.719 --> 01:21:52.560
they move yeah right and he says like he

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.920
has footage of like

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.679
[ __ ] [ __ ] being missing from them

01:21:55.679 --> 01:21:58.159
basically like he went in there and then

01:21:58.159 --> 01:22:00.400
he's accused of murdering his wife so he

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.920
had to lam it that's why he's in south

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.520
america right now but it's just one of

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.040
those things where it's like uh did you

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:07.040
murder your wife are you being set up is

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.880
both true like that'd be kind of funny

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.639
if it was like true but also he murdered

01:22:10.639 --> 01:22:13.280
his wife ultimate defense plan

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.960

these tapes like i can kill my wife now

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.560
i don't know this is a credible source

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.000

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.679
time ago and he's like yes guys you're

01:22:21.679 --> 01:22:23.360

just take that for what it for what it

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.719
