that clip mm-hmm the whole time like

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.180

where I've wanted to defend the clip

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.530
mm-hmm and then it's like

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.910
well then that opens the door because

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.850
now I have to defend everything cuz so

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.980
right when I got in trouble people were

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.480
like you need to apologize you need to

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.550
apologize hard yeah I was like I can't

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.800
dude I was rock hard every apology I

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.050
wrote I was here eck know this I'm so

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.140
[ __ ] sorry but like if I apologize

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.440
for that

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.110
an hour later another theater kids gonna

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.940
dig up like and this is what he said

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.500
about this yeah so yeah I mean obviously

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.739
I wanted to say sorry to anybody that

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.920
was actually offended and first off I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.180
don't think anybody that wrote any

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.130
article or anything like that was

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.769
remotely offended I don't think I don't

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.940
think a lot of people are offended by

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.360
anything I think they like to be victims

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.750
for sure now based on the DMS and emails

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.950
I got I think some people were upset

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.910
people were pretty upset they hit you up

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:25.230
yeah yeah non-stop which is funny

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.660
because every time cuz like T you got to

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.370
get through this you got a [ __ ] joke

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.110
sure like the only way you can get like

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.760
if I took this seriously for a second a

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.459
national scandal devastated if I if I

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.790
sat back for one second and was like man

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.970
that would [ __ ] blow yeah dude but if

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.950
I joke about what Dwyer on stage I

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.650
should but dude if I ever get on SNL I

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.350
will budweis live from my mouth this

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.980
[ __ ] guy

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.040
but yeah already I'm like Jesus Christ

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.450
how many quotes he's gonna kill himself

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.459
yeah I'll get to those [ __ ] gyros

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.239
later dude you knew they'd be so you

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.900
knew that was coming from hearts dude

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.269
the the funny thing is like any time I

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.350
would get a death row there's something

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.730
like I'd be walking down the street and

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.229
just get an alert and read it and it'd

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.930
be like [ __ ] you you fat racist piece of

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.700
[ __ ] I'm glad your careers over you

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.530
[ __ ] garbage human I hope everyone

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.210
dies that you know and I would just be

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.890
like well that's not exactly what I

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.010
would call constructive

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.900
just laugh to myself oh my god I was

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.160
actually thinking I was in the shower on

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.540
the way over here and I was thinking how

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.640
like you mean you have you have white

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.350
stone black stone dude you can choose

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.910
either path it looks like you'll be

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.920
funny to take it all the way and to

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.600
start going like deeply underground and

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.620
going and Instagram to like different

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.060
cities and sit in front of like the

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.920
Eiffel Tower or just say like a horrible

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.460
word and just be like in this phase out

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.150
the newspaper he [ __ ] did it again oh

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.380
well here's the thing the news is gonna

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.900
move on the news is already so I will

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.940
have to like read like a retreat as to

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.130
who I can be racist against just gonna

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.270
double down on the [ __ ]

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.800
this is doing the Italians they're

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.690
coming obviously yeah the formation

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.220
they're like you're gonna be races

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.600
against white people let's [ __ ] go

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.690
you're like yeah dude now you got them

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.060
coming after us but if someone was like

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.100
how this one was so funny this guy was

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.740
like he was like I hope you [ __ ] die

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.080
and it was all it was like jumbled it

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.300
was bad spelling so it's funny and then

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.610
it includes your name in the email list

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.980
I saw this name and then I saw what he

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.660
was typing and it made me laugh and he

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.640
was like you know he's the whole thing

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.230
of like I hope everybody you know dies

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.240
if you have a wife I hope she gets raped

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.790
in front of you if you don't if your

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.710
parents aren't dead I hope they die

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.450
slowly and then burn in hell like all

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.770
this stuff he was like these are just

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.390
jokes do you think this is funny and I

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.100
was honestly by myself laughing like

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:06.000
yeah dude it's like well there's another

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.070
thing there's like I was watching

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.300
something on YouTube and the guy was

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.970
talking about retirement of st. George's

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.380
retirement no st. George did want to

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.850
slay the dragon it's a guy who slayed

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.350
the dragon sure eventually slays the

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.640
dragon everyone's like you see George

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.960
the [ __ ] man's the Saint George

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.920
starts walking around looking for

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.650
dragons and he's like this listener is

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.650
pretty big he's like good guys I think

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.910
eventually comes down with due to

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.380
swinging his sword at the air and it got

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.780
another one yeah it's like some movers

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.290
the PO Box

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.800
thing is if you were the [ __ ] CEO of

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.910
like GlaxoSmithKline I can see people be

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:53.970

it's like do I want to go back and

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.580
defend that clip I mean yeah I do but I

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.710
know it's a waste of time what to be

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.000
like [ __ ] you guys I think you have

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.370
[ __ ] rules no not to be like yo that

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.990
was hilarious cuz it wasn't that funny I

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.490
mean we're just sitting in this room

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.390
talking yeah gibberish sure but also if

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.920
I do something like that or say

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.380
something like that it's never you know

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.620
in that clip mm-hmm I said man let the

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.390
[ __ ] chinks like that like with that

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.000
[ __ ] not as hard sure I should have

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.800
done it harder to make it clear like the

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.570
man yet it was clearly to me what I was

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.210
going for was pointing out how dumb

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.890
somebody would have to be to segregate a

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:02.460
neighborhood

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.560
yeah and the type of words they would

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.780
use now what really sucks is having to

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.080
break down comedy and explain anything

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.420
you know this is what I was doing

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.710
[ __ ] it I'm just gonna keep going we

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.850
were talking about the origin of

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.070
Chinatown and they reported as if we

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.390
were both like you ever been to [ __ ]

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.910
Chinatown braid so then I'm like [ __ ] I

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.170
go down there I'm like hey get all these

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.360
ducks out of the window it's like I'm

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.190
making fun of myself for being a fat

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.410
[ __ ] idiot that's the whole point

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.590
yeah in later in the clip the girl I was

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.890
with says oh I want neuters and I was

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:35.580
like no chill

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.840

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.639

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.880
if you dude it's again I've said it it's

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.470
like dude I fought the theater kids in

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.389
Philly that played dress-up and now I'm

00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:34.709
in New York fighting the theater kids

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:36.089
that play dress-up again yeah that's

00:10:36.089 --> 00:10:37.529
what I'm gonna do for the rest of my

00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:38.760
career that's what it is

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.829
it's a lifestyle dude you know come on

00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:44.329
man it's a [ __ ] lifestyle dude but uh

00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:47.639
yeah it's it is confusing as to what to

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:50.339
do what step it's funny that's one thing

00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:51.509
that's been really hard is getting

00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:53.490
advice from every single person every

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.920
single person on earth has an opinion on

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.110
what I should do and what's really

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.560
frustrating is when people kind of not

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.510
condescend but talk down to you about it

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.360
like like they know the answer or like

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.040
this is what I

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.380
do and it's like bro no one has done

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.779
this no one's gone from literally not

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:14.930
famous at all to just known as a racist

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.269
like just me and like the cops at

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:21.920
Ferguson [ __ ] track record like it's

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.790
[ __ ] crazy

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.829
there's nothing making even really judge

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:27.589
yeah I know it then I don't have a body

00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:28.910
of work for them to look back I'm gonna

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.529
be like yeah at least he's funny so

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:31.759
that's another thing that hurts that's

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:32.959
the thing that really hurts his other

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:36.139
comics being like he's not funny yeah

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:37.670
but I know where that comes from I know

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.720
where that comes from because I've done

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.779
it I've done it free we've talked talked

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:42.440
back

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.800
dude I've talked and I and the funny

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.540
thing is is the last question was was it

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.800
opportunistically you mean yeah no I

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.089
said I'm saying I saw blatant

00:11:53.089 --> 00:11:54.949
opportunism people being like I hear you

00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:56.630
I just saw the tape and I don't approve

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.930
here's my yeah yeah one lady wrote a

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.000
[ __ ] article to CNN I talked to her

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.480
yesterday

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.850
did you really and I was like I wasn't

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.470
mad again I told her the same like I'm

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.000
not mad at anyone it's all pimping dude

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.660
dude it's been pimping everybody's been

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.740
of course everybody's doing what they

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.470
have to do yeah and but she was like

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:16.760
yeah I have a book coming out next year

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.279
I was like oh there it is that might be

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:21.620
why you decided to you know be a total

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.040
hypocrite yeah so that's why she did

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.540
what she did but of course how's the

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:32.120
book oh sure it'll be great I'm gonna

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.529
have her autograph for me it's all worth

00:12:33.529 --> 00:12:35.480

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.610
book the platform to get that book

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.680

volleyball you know you know what dude

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.310

here in comics give me advice which I

00:12:47.899 --> 00:12:48.560

00:12:50.089 --> 00:12:53.420
place well somewhat a place of like I'd

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.130
like to help ya

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.899

everybody's gonna tuck her out the one

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.050
thing that's funny that reminded me of

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.000
remember that South Park episode where

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.160
there was there's two dudes that worked

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.130
at SeaWorld that tricked the kids into

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.750
believing the orcas could talk mm-hmm

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.040
they were like I need to live on the

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.560
moon with my moon family and then they

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.760
get shot and they're laying in the

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.500
street and they just see the whale

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.060
getting launched into space and they're

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.380
like never related to that more really

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.150
yeah just like yeah you got [ __ ]

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:06.190
levelled but like it was still funny

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.390
you're saying they're loving it or

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.530
you're loving no I don't think you saw

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.150
the episode I didn't I always like

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.500
whenever someone asked if I see anything

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.440
automatic ammo yes no it's well if you

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.400
haven't seen it it's tough to explain

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.870
I'll tell about the other episode where

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.140
know these two dudes in the episode

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.610
trick the kids of South Park into

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.560
believing the orcas can talk okay so the

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.190
kids

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.470
orchestrate a way to launch the whale

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:27.430
into space

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.950
and while the guys are laying there

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.600
and dead in the street in the distance

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.430
they see the whale actually getting

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.170
launched into space and they're just

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.230
laying there like it was still funny

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:38.940
[Laughter]

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:43.150
it's like we did this to be funny and

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.130
everybody did exactly what they were

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.770
supposed to do yes

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.570
again that's that's the funniest part

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.700
where it's like now the sights are on

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:58.480
comedy podcasts like I'm saying that's

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.820
how you were dug up yeah yeah these guys

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.840
aren't they're not they don't have the

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.540
tenacity to like start opposing a bunch

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.710
of comedy podcasts yeah what are they

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.220

anybody like me anytime soon which is

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.560
what was so surprising the whole time

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.820
it's like holy [ __ ] they're actually

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:27.640
hiring me yeah you know whatever you've

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.740
done the deep dive who them I don't know

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.990
I thought about it there were just too

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.850
many things out there to even try yes

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:40.120
like I mean what they got me on was not

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.340
much compared to what always floating

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.720
around although I will say this

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.750
reporters no n-words true that none on

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.940
my record true that zero n-word so I

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.080
thought I was in the clear you know

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.640
they're [ __ ] going out yeah like the

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.620
Trump tape dude oh they wanted that

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.750
n-word get 50 G's for a Gillison okay

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.140
baby

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.810
nah dude they were that's the Holy Grail

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.540
that is that's the absolute Holy Grail

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.810
to catch someone on yeah so there was

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.920
just too many things to try to hide Tran

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.630
so I wasn't even gonna how do you feel

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.430
now that it's kind of slightly washed

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:16.240
over um well kind of I mean the Emmys

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.220
were like [ __ ] two days ago and I was

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.850
a red carpet question their action value

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:24.430
it's like people in $20,000 dresses are

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.020
like how do you feel about known racist

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.080
Shango it's like I'm in [ __ ] gym

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:35.950
shorts and sandals in West Philly but um

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.200
yeah it'll blow over until this comes

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.180
out and then think you're gonna dig

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.310
through without a doubt people are gonna

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.390
listen to this and

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.550
quote this and nobody will listen to

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.850
this so the headlines will be shingles

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:56.200
thinks this is funny [ __ ] you [ __ ] it I

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.280

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.750
time the GP the GP is just looking at

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.180

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.870
of those weird things where it's like

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.930
it's almost an it's almost libelous to

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.240
be like to take someone something says

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.580

voice yeah that's how I [ __ ] said it

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.360
so well my thing is you can't be like

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.310

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.740
journalistic error no cuz then they got

the other one on relapse podcast where I

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.210
had just a bunch of gibberish racial

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.580
slurs followed by which no one ever gets

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.650
the end of these articles at the end of

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.260
that episode rum like there's a thing I

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.780

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.429
else to jump in and say something bad

00:20:00.429 --> 00:20:01.929

anybody that actually listens to the

00:20:10.269 --> 00:20:12.789

where I called Andrew yang a Jew Chang

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:17.049

these these guys are out here having fun

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.139

00:20:29.139 --> 00:20:31.299
in the basement yeah like clearly at the

00:20:31.299 --> 00:20:32.980
end of that I'm fully aware of what I'm

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.659
doing I just put an exclamation mark on

00:20:34.659 --> 00:20:38.350
the end of this yeah somebody quoted a I

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.760
was like it's so [ __ ] cool to be

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.179
racist someone has that would that not

00:20:43.179 --> 00:20:44.799

happened I fought with my girlfriend and

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:17.799
left yeah it's such a hard thing though

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:19.240
to have to explain to people you're like

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.870
I know I know it's just like you're

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:24.970
allowed to joke around but I said even a

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.070
joke is like I don't know it's just you

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.539
can [ __ ] around we're trying to make

00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:30.460
people laugh it's taking out of hundreds

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.799
of hours of material and someone's like

00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:36.779
here's 30 seconds yeah and it's also

00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:38.860
it's also we're doing this for an

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.409
audience of people that know we know

00:21:41.409 --> 00:21:43.750
what we're saying is wrong sure

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.460
everybody that listens to the podcast

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.010
hears us say dumb [ __ ] and says they

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.620
know what they're saying is dumb that's

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.510
why they're saying it there's no other

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.570
reason to say it but when someone that

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.820
doesn't know us listens to it they go

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.860
these guys don't know they're wrong and

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.169
they're saying wrong things yeah they're

00:22:02.169 --> 00:22:03.519
saying bad words lady hate in their

00:22:03.519 --> 00:22:04.960
hearts dude they listen this podcast

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.770
with hate in their hearts

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.100
you got manifested but hate on the page

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.330
of their [ __ ] journalist I'm just

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:10.580
about

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.980
I'm saying dude love conquers all I mean

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.620
dude I don't want to brag journalist but

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.730
we have like a wide spectrum of

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.970
ethnicities we do we do I know we do

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.649
don't do it how dare they

00:22:24.649 --> 00:22:26.269
I mean how dare they how dare they

00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:27.950
whites plain comedy for everybody else

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.299
that's wrong did whites plain common

00:22:29.299 --> 00:22:32.059
waist way in comedy also you can't punch

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:34.340
down which is your housing concept dude

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.840
so to say punch down insinuates that you

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.230
believe white people are superior yes

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.330
that's an odd thing yeah now the way

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.830
though though because they have answers

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.149
for all this though they'll push that

00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:49.100
away by being like well the system set

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.169
up for white people by who journalists

00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:55.159
that say when you say punch down and

00:22:55.159 --> 00:22:57.350
white people are at the top yeah

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.639
straight white guys are at the top and

00:22:58.639 --> 00:23:02.049
anybody we make fun of is punching down

00:23:02.049 --> 00:23:05.149
that's they never been in the trenches

00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:06.830
bro it's like dude I just don't view it

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:10.220
that way everyone's my [ __ ] kin dude

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.840

00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:16.399
bust chops yeah I mean not gonna be like

your haircut looks funny my black friend

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:21.980

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.539
your haircut looks a bit funny my black

00:23:23.539 --> 00:23:25.639

00:23:25.639 --> 00:23:27.620
lowly position yeah it's just [ __ ]

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.899
great dude it's it's what I'm saying is

00:23:29.899 --> 00:23:32.840
this [ __ ] is [ __ ] madness dude it's a

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.940
small amount of people I don't know how

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.620
the [ __ ] they control the newspapers but

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.450
it's like they're fired up dude and this

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.440

00:23:44.659 --> 00:23:46.909
[ __ ] credence of being like yeah

that's why I couldn't apologize cuz I

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.139
understand what it is and it's funny to

00:23:51.139 --> 00:23:52.580
have put that out and then have people

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.679
be like this is a [ __ ] apology it's

00:23:54.679 --> 00:23:57.590
like yeah dude not apologize I apologize

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.690
to anybody that's actually offended and

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.340
I do feel bad about that for sure

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.769
anybody that never listened to this

00:24:03.769 --> 00:24:05.570
podcast never [ __ ] has any idea about

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.309
context and then reads a headline that a

00:24:07.309 --> 00:24:09.740
guy at SNL is using those words yeah

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.539
that probably hurts some people yeah but

00:24:11.539 --> 00:24:13.220
it's that probably hurts people's

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:13.700
feelings

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.380
for sure and I feel bad about but it's

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.200
also reported in an inaccurate manner

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.149
well whoever reported it should probably

00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:22.010
feel bad they won't though [ __ ] out

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.750
they won't and that's another thing that

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:24.830
you know I don't want to sound too far

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.990
like I think I'm profound but like of

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.250
course throughout this whole thing

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.710
there's been nights and times where I'd

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.000
be like laying there and being like damn

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.500
dude am I wrong

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.420
like am i [ __ ] up am i wrong about

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.600
this and then to remember that you I

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.340
know the other side has never had that

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:40.850
thought

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.340
they've never sat back him in like maybe

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.160
I'm wrong about this maybe he so that's

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.110
reassuring knowing that I at least

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.720
questioned myself non-stop mm-hmm I know

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.330
the other side doesn't do that no it's a

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.190
[ __ ] religion it's a [ __ ] religion

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.920

people in my school tell me you have to

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.000
suspend your logical faculties and just

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.340

[ __ ] on the subway but uh yeah that's

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:15.480
it that was one of my favorite things

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.039
this one article found that picture of

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:18.809
me and camouflaged with a sheet shirt

00:27:18.809 --> 00:27:22.039
clearly posing like a [ __ ] shooter

00:27:22.039 --> 00:27:25.200
looking like an exact white supremacist

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.610
where'd they get that it's on my

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.000
Instagram it's a funny picture but uh my

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.789
dude my social media is dead yeah there

00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:35.220
was that one shitty blog that tried to

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.380
take me down it was all wrong it was so

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:43.049
[ __ ] hot yeah yeah I got a blog some

00:27:43.049 --> 00:27:48.419
blog from Bob dude sick actually and it

00:27:48.419 --> 00:27:49.830
was like all of it was like he lives in

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.690
New Jersey false false that's the thing

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.669
to know it's a small blog

00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:55.409
wrong but it also shows you what's going

00:27:55.409 --> 00:27:57.390
on it's like you have a person who's now

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.940
making pretty severe accusations against

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.399
me who's nude check the links none of

00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:04.320
the links link to anything sir like here

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.059
you know if obviously I was an online

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:07.200
journalist before I know how this works

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.570
you make a claim you got to link it to

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.130
like your source so you have if you make

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:12.450
a claim you have to hyperlink it and

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:14.940
also drives up SEO - yeah so if you

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.409
linked to other things it helps in like

00:28:16.409 --> 00:28:18.330
the search thing so she would link to

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.679
stuff and it would go nowhere which is

00:28:19.679 --> 00:28:21.779
dead end yeah and then it was like lives

00:28:21.779 --> 00:28:23.159
in New Jersey false

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:26.460

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.700
just puts it out as if it's a fact and

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.380
it's like dude that's your job you're

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.700
like you guys suck at comedy that's not

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.289
it's like you're a [ __ ] journalist

00:28:34.289 --> 00:28:36.240
and you cannot report the thing

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.760
accurately yeah so foot like it's just

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.730

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.409
pickle right now what happened I'm like

00:29:18.409 --> 00:29:21.149
it's kind of tricky to explain but you

00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:24.840
know I know people who like whatever

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.230

I told my lyft driver the whole

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.620
situation he was just like hey who's

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.299
really strong in support for us lyft

00:29:30.299 --> 00:29:32.340

00:29:35.879 --> 00:29:38.879
situation to this dude and uh yeah he

00:29:38.879 --> 00:29:41.850
was just kind of like okay yeah whatever

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.049

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:49.110
yeah man I mean you guys are what it's a

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.110
comedy podcast bro yeah I think that's

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:52.919
another thing that's really

00:29:52.919 --> 00:29:54.690
underestimated by these people is how

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:56.850
much normal people really don't give a

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.289
[ __ ] now normal people don't give a

00:29:58.289 --> 00:29:59.809
[ __ ]

00:29:59.809 --> 00:30:01.649
obviously again if you have your

00:30:01.649 --> 00:30:03.690
pronouns and your bio you're gonna be

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.490
upset because that's your thing that's

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.500
your currency victimhood is their

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.330
currency so they're gonna keep being

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.210
like well I'm offended again yeah of

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.220

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.379
they it's funny too because we talked

00:30:16.379 --> 00:30:19.679
about this before like seeing comedy

00:30:19.679 --> 00:30:21.360

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.370
bit and I was like sitting back like

this this is what I've been working for

00:30:25.919 --> 00:30:28.080
yeah I've always been against what's

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.090
happening in comedy mm-hmm and I was

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.610

transparent it is and that's that's been

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.170
the problem we've had with all this

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.970
since the start of this that's the whole

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.130
base how transparent all this [ __ ] has

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.440
been self-serving it's it's not like

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.970
we're upset with it we're haven't added

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.040

it's just a funny statement it's it's

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.940
funny to pretend to be upset about these

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.560
things yeah to sit here and be like not

like we got him he's doing stand-up he's

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.480
doing stand-up again like we were

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.740
listening to the Germans and you know

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.560

science like that's actually good

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.210
[ __ ] science

yes so there's there's I did want to

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:14.970
keep doing stand-up and keep having them

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.040
quote me doing stand-up because this

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.290
what we're doing right now will without

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:22.290
a doubt be greatly [ __ ] misquoted

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.670
you think it'll be scrutinized I

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.070
couldn't be more certain than this

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:29.250
episode will be not good what could I do

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.140
to act most superlative

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.750

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.660
yeah that's another fun [ __ ]

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.519
accusation is that I'm some [ __ ] like

00:35:38.519 --> 00:35:41.099
alright Trump supporter which was so

00:35:41.099 --> 00:35:43.170
funny because when this whole thing

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.460
happened then I got in trouble for like

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.920
homophobia and racism everybody on the

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.480
right was like that's just free speech

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.279
baby free speech and then I was like I

00:35:50.279 --> 00:35:51.960
had to be funny if Trump got shot they

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:59.279
were all like call the FBI they also

00:35:59.279 --> 00:36:00.720
kind of that one's kind of thrown for a

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.279
loop they're just like who picked that

00:36:02.279 --> 00:36:03.990
up that was Fox right everybody

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.930
everybody picked up that quote Fox

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.299
really ran with it yeah man yeah I mean

00:36:09.299 --> 00:36:11.490

it's so hard and then as soon as I moved

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:34.369
to me so I talked [ __ ] on a bunch of

00:40:34.369 --> 00:40:35.660
comics that I thought were getting

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.530

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.240
happened before I moved to New York I

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.190

you know this is a human behavior across

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:55.560
the board the spectrum of humanity

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.170

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.810
was just dead I was like [ __ ] is that

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:43.000
five days about six days I'm just yeah I

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.350
don't know I don't even know how long it

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:45.860
was how'd you sleep

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.170
okay okay sorry like throughout the

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:49.670
weekend yeah it was fine sleep and

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:54.290
gotcha yeah all of a sudden it just all

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:56.930
that adrenaline dissipate dissipates and

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:59.690
you're just like whoa what the [ __ ] just

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:01.040
happened

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.660
and then I'm you know I'm still getting

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:03.950
calls from management and all these

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:06.220
people it's like I don't give a [ __ ]

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:09.830
yeah everybody had a game plan as to how

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.200
to handle it mm-hmm and none of them you

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.400
can punch a hole in every single one

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.290
because nobody's done this there's no

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:16.610
playbook for this yeah

00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:19.160
there's I'm getting [ __ ] on by everyone

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:20.570
I'm getting [ __ ] on by comics I'm

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.640
getting [ __ ] on by the media everybody

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:27.070
and so any plan gets [ __ ] crushed

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:31.330
because like let's say I go sit down

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:35.420
with [ __ ] Andrew yang there's a ton

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.640
of holes in that like how that could go

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.060
bad

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:42.050
sure let's say I go on [ __ ] CNN that's

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:44.180
embarrassing you could go on and be

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.940
political about comedy that would suck

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.770
and to have unless you if you go to

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:50.360

whole time it's true and I I don't know

00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:18.730
I mean the thing to again with inter in

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:19.960
terms of the comics talking I'm just

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.310
trying to stand up dude I'm just trying

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:24.130

just trying to do her dad thing he's

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:27.550
trying to flow yeah bro but when I see

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:29.050
the comics talking [ __ ] I wouldn't feel

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:31.870
badly because again it seemed I saw a

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:33.520
lot of back and forth type responses big

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.440
[ __ ] dude comics stick together and

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.870
then like a day later being like it's

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:38.500
not funny

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.410
[ __ ] [ __ ] him yeah people said [ __ ] me a

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.120
couple of times like the other guy sucks

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.550
and I'm like [ __ ] you dude well they all

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:47.500
had to backpedal so they supported me

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:48.850
and then the way they could keep their

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:50.410
integrity to be like you can say

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:51.940
whatever you want that's what everybody

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:52.360
wants

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.920
in comedy everybody wants to be like you

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.570
can say whatever as long as it's funny

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:58.150
mm-hmm this wasn't funny this was just

00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:59.920
hate speech so they get to keep their

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.860
integrity they get to shun me yeah and

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.570
keep their own thing keep their comic

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:05.890
that's what they're doing so that's fine

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:07.090
I understand

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:08.920
yeah I know what they're doing now if I

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.140
heard that clip you and me heard that

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.820
cliff I heard a guy got fired from SNL

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:14.860
for using racial slurs I'd be like yeah

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.960
I got [ __ ] rules dude a guy's

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:21.430

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:27.940
laughing at that situation yeah

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:30.370
you were viewing it in a way that's meta

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:33.040
being like hilarious the guy got on SNL

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.830
the situation is funny now someone would

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:37.600
say that I'm like Shane Gillis thinks it

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.940
would be awesome if someone got fired

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:42.760
for yeah that's what they do and they're

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.400
they're missing out on the Birdseye

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.530
advantage they just don't have dude they

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:49.420
don't have it yeah being like goddamn

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.280
that's a funny [ __ ] situation yeah

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:51.640
man

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:57.070
there is South Park yeah this is that

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:58.720
episode where the Orca gets launched to

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.430
the moon and those dudes that just got

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:04.030
shot or laying there being like like

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:06.570
that's crazy that's funny

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:10.000
yeah and then there's there's people

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.500
that are like oh don't don't fall into

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.150
being like an alright guy it's like dude

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.749
I'm

00:53:13.749 --> 00:53:15.579
yeah I don't give a [ __ ] your Nazi

00:53:15.579 --> 00:53:18.050
politics yeah I'm not even all right

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:20.190
[Laughter]

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:23.279
[ __ ] it is like if you're against

00:53:23.279 --> 00:53:25.660
what the what these people are

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:29.200
propagating you are all right exactly so

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.029
it's not my whole point is is what I was

00:53:31.029 --> 00:53:33.039
trying to say it's not something I

00:53:33.039 --> 00:53:34.539
obviously see how it's something to be

00:53:34.539 --> 00:53:36.789
worried about but you can't because it's

00:53:36.789 --> 00:53:37.989
not up to you whether you're these

00:53:37.989 --> 00:53:40.420
things or not it's up to whether a kind

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.019
of particularly nasty frustrated

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:45.339
power-hungry individual decides to use

00:53:45.339 --> 00:53:46.960
you as you know what I'm saying yeah of

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.519
course but can't be like look here's all

00:53:48.519 --> 00:53:49.749
my [ __ ] and they're like Kate you would

00:53:49.749 --> 00:53:52.359
say that [ __ ] you no matter what I say

00:53:52.359 --> 00:53:54.369
it's bad it's something I'm aware of

00:53:54.369 --> 00:53:55.720
that yeah

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.759
it's been hard to figure out what to do

00:53:57.759 --> 00:54:01.989
but yeah I'm just gonna keep doing

00:54:01.989 --> 00:54:05.470
stand-up that's all I can do and let

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:06.700
people decide for themselves if they

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:08.380
think it's funny yeah it's your

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.730
constitutional right you can carry a gun

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:13.170
do stand-up food not a problem

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:15.489
you're bringing a gun to stand up and

00:54:15.489 --> 00:54:16.869
you're gonna do speak whatever the [ __ ]

00:54:16.869 --> 00:54:20.380
you want I hear you hell yeah here's a

00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:27.730
quote what yeah I mean they're gonna

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:29.140
have to rip that gun out of your [ __ ]

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:34.450
hands we got to pry them like are the

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:39.279
government's come and take our mics man

00:54:39.279 --> 00:54:41.319
the PC police man they're gonna come

00:54:41.319 --> 00:54:46.359
what the [ __ ] I don't know I don't want

00:54:46.359 --> 00:54:49.180
to be well you could you could be a good

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:50.829
thing too cause we could always get so

00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:52.359
if you're a podcast or what you should

00:54:52.359 --> 00:54:54.789
do is sublet or have your parents like

00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:56.650
sell you the basement as a condo because

00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:58.960
there'll be a whole separate warrant so

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.489
they came to serve it you could be like

00:55:00.489 --> 00:55:01.989
a few kicked in my door that was a

00:55:01.989 --> 00:55:03.579
[ __ ] false arrest there before they

00:55:03.579 --> 00:55:04.569
throw it out in court and you get your

00:55:04.569 --> 00:55:06.819
mics back true that's what I'm saying

00:55:06.819 --> 00:55:08.859
yeah I hear that we got a [ __ ] we got

00:55:08.859 --> 00:55:10.329
a yesterday warrants on a federal

warrant on this same day they're coming

00:55:14.519 --> 00:55:17.009
another thing I was worried about was

00:55:17.009 --> 00:55:19.150
sounding like I wanted to be the [ __ ]

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:20.529
mouthpiece for comedy

00:55:20.529 --> 00:55:23.230

where God I'm [ __ ] new yeah so if like

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:31.710

everybody acted exactly how they're

01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:27.240
supposed to act yeah now the thing that

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.040
changed was I was supposed to grovel and

martyr because there's not what I want I

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.240
want to have a real career what uh I

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.820

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.800
this like [ __ ] thing when there's

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.840
someone in a social station who's

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.180
clearly above you I've been in it in a

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.340
way different way but that's like he

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.530

like but to be honest firing me did

01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:30.640

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:36.969
crowd react yeah when you look they just

01:16:36.969 --> 01:16:40.270
go yeah that'll dissipate sure that'll

01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:42.100
that'll [ __ ] die damn people aren't

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.000
going to give me a standing ovation

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.310
every [ __ ] course now but they'll be

01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:48.640
nice guys you know see the bull [ __ ]

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.070

that is nice oh that's a nice that's

01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:56.500
again I don't want to sound too corny

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.170
but boy what a nice place to be is doing

01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:00.489
stand-up throughout this whole thing

01:17:00.489 --> 01:17:03.400
yeah like there during the day life just

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.010
is just like a dick punch and it's like

01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:07.989
you get to go to stand up and get you

01:17:07.989 --> 01:17:10.570
know people laughing it's fun and

01:17:10.570 --> 01:17:12.010
everybody can just be like all right

01:17:12.010 --> 01:17:14.230
enough of this [ __ ] again that's the

01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:16.120
whole [ __ ] point dude I mean it

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.680
sounds so redundant but you're literally

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.050
eliciting a reaction out of people so

01:17:20.050 --> 01:17:21.400
it's like you know you're a fisherman

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.870
you don't use the same lure every time

01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:27.160
you're chucking [ __ ] in the water snag

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.090
the bobber on that one yeah do that and

01:17:31.090 --> 01:17:32.860
it's it's such a weird thing to try to

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.270
defend like it's indefensible and it's

01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.750
like

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:37.270
in the realm of what the newspaper is

01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:39.610
writing about yeah but if you look into

01:17:39.610 --> 01:17:40.780
comedy and you're like what's this

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:42.760
person trying to do and as soon as you

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.350
go in a comedy and say no no you can't

01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:46.450
do that it's like you're fried cuz then

01:17:46.450 --> 01:17:48.430
it just the line just go do it you just

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:49.900
let the crowd react if you're out laughs

01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:51.790
awesome if they don't oh it's a bad

01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:53.200
feeling what everyone feels it and you

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.940
know yeah and that's it that's another

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:57.400
thing like I don't use on stage I don't

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.960
use words like that because I don't know

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.270
who's in the audience sure when it's on

01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:03.670
this podcast or [ __ ] Legion of skanks

01:18:03.670 --> 01:18:05.680
or any these podcasts I know who's in

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.600
the audience I know who's listening

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.220
who's downloading in an hour and a half

01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.080
of canto I know who's listening and I

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:11.890
know they're not gonna get their

01:18:11.890 --> 01:18:13.810
feelings hurt yeah so I can say whatever

01:18:13.810 --> 01:18:15.700
the [ __ ] I want yep if you're listening

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:18.310
to this podcast I know you don't give a

01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:21.190
[ __ ] yeah so I'll say whatever if I'm on

01:18:21.190 --> 01:18:22.840
stage and I don't know who's in the

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.760
audience which I don't I won't say those

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.320
things I don't use those words on stage

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:29.550
true it's that simple

01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:32.800
case closed dude that's a pin in it it's

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:43.450
not this case is not closed local scene

01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:47.650
I can't even get into it's not it's okay

01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:48.910
they all did what they do

01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:51.400
oh my my the thing that bothered me you

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.750
know I was telling Bernie that somebody

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:54.550
it was all so predictable dude it was oh

01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:56.080
nice assault it I was that was what like

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.610
really threw me for the biggest loop

01:18:57.610 --> 01:18:59.020
when I was just watching like this

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:01.140
person's gonna do this and they did that

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:04.540
that's probably you know just like just

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:06.370
transparent predictable yeah [ __ ]

01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:08.020
sucked and the predictable thing would

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:10.240
mean it would be me to go out after all

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.430
that me like I need to learn a lesson

01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:14.080
and I apologize and all you guys are

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:17.080
above me and you know the morality I'm

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.050
wrong I'm not gonna do that suck our

01:19:20.050 --> 01:19:20.890
dicks to all our enemies

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:23.830
yeah sure done emoji the [ __ ] devil

01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:27.570
like the smiley deal the responses to

01:19:27.570 --> 01:19:29.500
NBC's press release that they were

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:32.020
firing me I had so many [ __ ] funny

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:35.560
ones just like God just gifts like the

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.240
Alonzo Mourning gif have you ever seen

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:41.140
that Rizzo he's like shaking his head

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:42.280
that they're getting killed and then he

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:45.760
like comes to terms with why they yeah

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.260
look at the Lonzo morning gif and

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:48.440
imagine that's how iris

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.660
on it but the one thing I do regret out

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:52.280
of the first statement I made which by

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.780
the way I made in five minutes

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.699
sure I had like five minutes to make

01:19:55.699 --> 01:19:56.870
that statement yeah first of all I'd

01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:59.000
have to say if anyone if anyone's like

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.760
to fool you should [ __ ] move huh

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.620
you'll never feel that pressure no no

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:05.780
one will and I wouldn't anyone that's

01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:07.250
what really annoyed me was hearing other

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:09.350
comics be like you shouldn't have said

01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:11.300
this I'm like bro you know don't worry

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:11.750
about it

01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:13.280
you'll never be on that [ __ ]

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.020
microscope you'll never have it so don't

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.640
even [ __ ] worry about it I can't

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:19.550
imagine the thing I do regret is the

01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:21.620
comedian who pushes boundaries as soon

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:25.180
as I said that as a damn [ __ ] corny

01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:27.800
I'm a comedian who pushes boundaries

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.900
which pounds dude that was embarrassing

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:31.610
that's the if I'm apologizing for

01:20:31.610 --> 01:20:34.190
anything I apologize for writing that

01:20:34.190 --> 01:20:35.780
I'm a comedian who pushes boundaries

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:39.140
that shit's corny that is but other than

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:42.080
that I would love this the fact that you

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.660
even through all of it

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:47.199
didn't completely cave and be like I

01:20:47.199 --> 01:20:49.520
just have a lot to think about I'm now

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.710
in therapy for my actions I'm doing

01:20:51.710 --> 01:20:54.290
implicit bias tasida can't do it it's

01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:55.130
something besided

01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:56.989
can't do it and do this the fadeaway

01:20:56.989 --> 01:20:59.000
jump shot at the second statement Matt

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.520
David somebody wrote an article about

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.440
that about the statement general the

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.530
MADtv comment a being loved like this is

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:08.690
why he said MADtv there was it was a

01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:11.180
very intentional statement and they're

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:12.860
like this is the type of jokes MADtv

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:14.750
used to do and he brought up like Miss

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:17.180
Swan do remember that character the lady

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:20.000
who does Family Guy's she does Lois okay

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.400
I forget her name she was a character I

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:25.310
met she was a cast member of MADtv magic

01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:26.840
MADtv was too problematic for me I never

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.880
watch that I understand I appreciate I

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.000
appreciate your sensibilities but they

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.739
had one character that was like yes yes

01:21:36.739 --> 01:21:41.420
really she was hilarious so they dug

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:42.590
into that and thought that that's what I

01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:44.210
was hinting it obviously it's like no I

01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:45.680
was just trying to make a joke the

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:47.660
[ __ ] shame Illuminati dude they

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:48.680
looked into the eye of the Shane

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.180
Illuminati he's like we're these people

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:53.380
talking symbols dude yeah no I'm a [ __ ]

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:56.270
and I've never argued that it's nothing

01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:59.290
to do I'm a [ __ ] idiot history buff

01:21:59.290 --> 01:22:01.940
kind of give me that until I run into a

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:02.980
real

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:05.330
once I start talking about the [ __ ]

01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:06.830
Mongolians like Matt Matt shut it down

01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:09.890
yeah I'm out I'm out of my league here

01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:13.070
but yeah the the apologies are what and

01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:14.450
that was funny to the people on Twitter

01:22:14.450 --> 01:22:16.520
be like this is not an apology it's like

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:19.700
yeah no [ __ ] yeah no [ __ ] dude like

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:21.500
anyone who's actually offended what the

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.720
[ __ ] is that supposed to mean exactly

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:26.120
what it means I don't think a lot of you

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:26.840
are offended

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:30.830
I just don't think maybe I'm wrong you

01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:32.030
know I don't think many of you are

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:35.480
really hurt yeah now again to reiterate

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.330
this cuz said it a bunch of times if I

01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:41.300
was a [ __ ] an Asian kid and I [ __ ]

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:43.250
looked online and the first status was

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:45.290
or the first quote was the SNL member

01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:47.750
uses racial slurs against Asians that

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:50.570
would hurt yeah maybe that would be like

01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:51.200
ah [ __ ]

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.960

Beach Jack you - Venice Beach just tell

01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:40.889
he's a motivational speaker yeah who was

01:24:40.889 --> 01:24:42.480
in jail for 10 years but he was like

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.830
when you're in jail and they talk it

01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:45.750
they bring black tears in eyes i watch

01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:47.130
I've been researching all this because

01:24:47.130 --> 01:24:48.780
there'll be like black as you apparently

01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:50.820
you get into jail in Southern California

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:52.440
you have to join a gang don't you don't

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.540
have any money if you have someone you

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:55.889
can pay for protection and just kind of

01:24:55.889 --> 01:24:57.960
fall back and chill but he was like if

01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.040
you're a white dude

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.360
white dudes come up to you and they're

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.530
like you're either gonna put in work

01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:04.710
with us or we're gonna smash you yeah so

01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:06.300
you like bloody picked this episode to

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:07.800
bring up the Aryan Brotherhood I'm

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.639
saying they say you know it was so funny

01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:13.440
because his message honestly dude

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.540
because he says he's like racism's the

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:17.190
[ __ ] epitome of ignorance [ __ ] that

01:25:17.190 --> 01:25:18.719
[ __ ] then he'll be like talking about

01:25:18.719 --> 01:25:20.280
prison he's like and if I saw a white

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:26.790
man so here's what's gonna happen what

01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:29.040
someone's gonna be like and then they

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.290
discussed Aryan Brotherhood and they

01:25:31.290 --> 01:25:33.330
likened it to their comp like that's how

01:25:33.330 --> 01:25:34.949
they're gonna not like I know you're not

01:25:34.949 --> 01:25:36.630
here's no you're not I know you're not

01:25:36.630 --> 01:25:37.860
here's what I'm saying here's what I'm

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:39.449
saying say it this is what happened

01:25:39.449 --> 01:25:41.070
they're gonna same thing with the MADtv

01:25:41.070 --> 01:25:43.080
comment they're gonna be like oh and

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.150
they very intentionally plugged this

01:25:45.150 --> 01:25:49.619
guy's name he motivates me to work out

01:25:49.619 --> 01:25:52.560
every morning that's before he's so

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.510
[ __ ] jacked and blasted it's like

01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:56.280
he's a thick dude I've seen him he's

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.409
[ __ ] [ __ ] up part it was funny what

01:25:58.409 --> 01:26:01.710
made me laugh is like why of all the

01:26:01.710 --> 01:26:03.060
gangs because white people are

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:05.190
disproportionately whatever

01:26:05.190 --> 01:26:06.869
misrepresented in jail in terms of their

01:26:06.869 --> 01:26:08.850
yeah your numbers aren't strong in jail

01:26:08.850 --> 01:26:10.440
if you're a white dude so if you're

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:14.840
forming a gang why do they become Nazis

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.219
it's a bad move dude

01:26:17.219 --> 01:26:18.960
it's like you guys like if you're black

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:20.760
you be crimp blood gangster disables you

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.440
got options yeah and apparently that all

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:23.880
stays - it's like you don't [ __ ] around

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:24.989
outside your race but like you don't

01:26:24.989 --> 01:26:26.940
really think about this when white dudes

01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:28.170
go to jail for some reason there

01:26:28.170 --> 01:26:33.480
like Nazis it's kind of scary I don't

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:37.140
know KB Nazis anywhere else money of

01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:39.870
they were just Amish what's a white

01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:42.690

01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.190
to he's like you've got the Southsiders

01:33:31.190 --> 01:33:33.170
there you have the northsiders there's

01:33:33.170 --> 01:33:34.550
like you're working everyone's working

01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:36.470
out together it goes like no one's

01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:39.350
allowed to so you if you're isolating

01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:40.910
and working out then they'll say you get

01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:42.830
a not a strike but it's called I figured

01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:45.020
it's called it's a confirmation it's

01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:46.940
something like showing your doing gang

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:48.770
activity so they can put points on you

01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:50.540
and put you into a higher thing so all

01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.280
these groups work out together but

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.540
they're all secretly doing they're like

01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:55.610
you know like there's a certain thing

01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:57.110
for like the Crips do a certain count

01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:58.490
they all have their own like symbolic

01:33:58.490 --> 01:33:59.930
counts yeah but they have to do it in

01:33:59.930 --> 01:34:01.250
close quarters so they don't get called

01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:03.440
out for being in like activity so it's

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:04.550
actually kind of a nice thing they all

01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.910
do

01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:07.250
yeah they cooperate it's just an

01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:08.450

01:44:40.890 --> 01:44:42.960
anything yeah yeah the Walmart near my

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:45.179

good [ __ ] health crisis dude yeah I

01:44:47.489 --> 01:44:50.219
was just at the Walmart in Mechanicsburg

01:44:50.219 --> 01:44:51.989
trying to buy flea medication at [ __ ]

01:44:51.989 --> 01:44:52.830

people in a row walking in and I was

01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:17.219
like it's got to be a coincidence so I

01:45:17.219 --> 01:45:19.469
just start doing light research I'm like

01:45:19.469 --> 01:45:23.010

01:45:41.730 --> 01:45:42.929
sudden I see someone else who was like

01:45:42.929 --> 01:45:44.070
too skinny

01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:50.160
I'm like a big boom like this is crazy

01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:51.810

here yeah is about to die at like 40 yup

01:45:56.219 --> 01:45:57.870
some people freak out about

01:45:57.870 --> 01:46:00.150
overpopulation it's like I read this to

01:46:00.150 --> 01:46:03.420
hell it's like people are like how

01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:05.340
they're not having a lot of kids and how

01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:07.590
in 20 years population is gonna drop so

01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:10.290
[ __ ] hard in America in America in

01:46:10.290 --> 01:46:12.810
[ __ ] Asia that's dropping hard dude

01:46:12.810 --> 01:46:14.870
he's in populations yeah you know

01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:17.330
blown up is Africa yeah because they

01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:20.620
finally are getting like health care

01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:23.090
amen so those populations that's the

01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:24.740
those are the two areas that had jumped

01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:27.460
India Africa China those the sky

01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:30.740
generation is only having like 1.2 kids

01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:32.780
on average what the thing is they're

01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:34.700
like in 30 years population once all

headliner the more [ __ ] they give you in

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:36.010
terms of their credits the worse of a

01:53:36.010 --> 01:53:38.230
comic they usually are it's when a comic

01:53:38.230 --> 01:53:40.050
has to be like I remember the time I did

01:53:40.050 --> 01:53:42.550

01:59:05.639 --> 01:59:07.199
I could Trump out on this honestly I

01:59:07.199 --> 01:59:09.329
thought SNL was using you I thought a

01:59:09.329 --> 01:59:10.590
conspiracy in my head that they were

01:59:10.590 --> 01:59:12.209

watch not stopping oh my god and then

01:59:17.729 --> 01:59:19.079

bothers me too it was like this is a

01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:29.410
conspiracy

01:59:29.410 --> 01:59:32.200
SNL picked him so they could do this and

01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:33.700

yeah that [ __ ] conspiracy thing of

02:00:34.930 --> 02:00:36.880
like I think they just picked cuz it's

02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:38.590
coming from comics that could never get

02:00:38.590 --> 02:00:40.360
what I just got yeah so they're all like

02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:42.250

about that maybe he was [ __ ] funny

02:01:04.510 --> 02:01:08.620
enough to get SNL yeah maybe true that

02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:11.080
you know you could still be funny enough

02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:14.710
to fit into conspiracy sure couldn't

02:01:14.710 --> 02:01:16.060
just on anybody but I hear you're saying

02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:17.080
I never thought about it from that angle

02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:19.180
people being like yeah I mean they saw

02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:21.220
you and they're listening to comics be

02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:22.630
like he's you know he's [ __ ] trump

02:01:22.630 --> 02:01:25.960
supporting [ __ ] idiot that's why they

02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:27.160
picked him and now they get to fire him

02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:29.110
and look good yeah that's not what

02:01:29.110 --> 02:01:31.960
happened no behind closed doors of the

02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:33.700
meeting first off well I ain't

02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:35.650
you didn't Inc the [ __ ] deal dude mhm

02:01:35.650 --> 02:01:37.600
heard that I hear you on that

02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:39.280
yeah I'm gonna stop spreading

02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:41.289
kind of conspiracy theory I don't give a

02:01:41.289 --> 02:01:44.469
[ __ ] but yeah there's there's there's

02:01:44.469 --> 02:01:46.210
listening to comics that will never ever

02:01:46.210 --> 02:01:48.969
have this be like well I could I mean

02:01:48.969 --> 02:01:50.260
they just pick somebody at random it's

02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:52.239
not it has nothing to a talent I could

02:01:52.239 --> 02:01:55.119
have got that there's truth of that dude

02:01:55.119 --> 02:01:56.679
I bet you couldn't that's truth of that

02:01:56.679 --> 02:01:59.860
again my personal ethos all about

02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:01.420
tapping into your own life but again

02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:03.070
like you're saying when you feel the

02:02:03.070 --> 02:02:05.619
pull of like something that big sucking

02:02:05.619 --> 02:02:07.809
you up I mean don't make the illusion

02:02:07.809 --> 02:02:09.489
don't have illusions about yourself that

02:02:09.489 --> 02:02:11.409
you'll just be like I'm sticking to my

02:02:11.409 --> 02:02:18.460
plan yeah it's like although now people

02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:23.289
probably like know everything I mean

02:02:23.289 --> 02:02:24.639
yeah every single person will still say

02:02:24.639 --> 02:02:26.199
yes get back to you in a couple weeks

02:02:26.199 --> 02:02:27.520
every single person would still say yes

02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:30.849
yeah it's also funny to turn it down

02:02:30.849 --> 02:02:34.690
like know exactly the [ __ ] you talking

02:02:34.690 --> 02:02:38.099
about no well no I didn't even know they

02:02:38.099 --> 02:02:41.110
no don't believe you I'd also like to

02:02:41.110 --> 02:02:42.520
you know it's also interesting to
