00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:01.367
Oh, my-
So.

00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.002
We had a zillion and one.

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.305
Did you see the fucking Steven
Seagal karate display video yet?

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:07.907
Of course I did.
Of course I did.

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.876
How have we not talked about
that for three hours of a show?

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.210
Maybe 'cause they did put

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.612
a four-hour pedo doc out
on Michael Jackson.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:15.015
I know. There's too
many things at once.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.822
We were nuts deep into the
Michael Jackson documentary.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:24.724
Yeah, man. Yeah.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:29.495
Leaving Neverland, the two-part
documentary series on HBO

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:31.530
that came out on Sunday
and Monday.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.032
Talked about it
all day yesterday.

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:34.633
It took me forever to watch it.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:36.935
Yeah, it's a lot of stopping
and making fun of.

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:38.104
Stopping and wincing.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.339
Stopping and cumming-
Yeah.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.873
... and then being disinterested

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:42.542
and then having to get
horny again to go back to it.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.477
And then making some dinner
and then all of a sudden

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.746
your wiener brushes up
against your basketball shorts.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.414
And then you remember, like,
oh yeah,

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:51.317
I've still got
some of that documentary left.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.319
I don't think we finished
the Wade part.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.791
I don't know if Wade got
mushroom capped just yet.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.292
So, Vecchione walks in,
it's like,

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.626
"Where you watching
the documentary?"

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.462
He goes, "It's paused
where I came."

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:05.331
You're gonna find out
right where I popped.

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:07.300
He goes, "He asked
if I had the underwear."

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.170
We go, "Aw, you dirty dog!"

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.938
Oh, man. That was ...
Where did we leave-

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:14.073
I'm hoping Shane watched it.
I told Shane to watch it.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.240
He did.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.575
He did?
He did.

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:19.279
Yes. Coming in here
just step for step.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.747
Oh, yeah, no,
he definitely saw it.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.815
He's pretty wigged out, too.
Everybody is.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:24.817
Yeah, it's a fucked up
documentary.

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.454
Christine loved Michael Jackson
when she was younger.

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:29.923
Becky, how old are you?

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.123
Thirty-two.

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:32.458
So you loved MJ, too.

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.626
She said when she became
aware of him

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:37.329
was almost through
the allegations.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:38.698
So almost always
came into it like,

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:40.299
why listen to this guy's shit,
right?

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.701
'Cause, like,
he's a piece of garbage.

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.069
What a weird ...

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.305
That's so crazy just because
of how colossal he was.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.906
How big his fame was.
That you find-

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:49.075
She only knows him
as a molester first.

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:51.877
You go, "Oh my god, I love Beat
It by Michael Jackson".

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:54.380
She goes, "Is that the guy
that beat all those charges?"

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.848
Who gave that molester a career?

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:58.117
Wait, that's the guy
that got called innocent

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:01.721
on ten counts in Santa Barbara?
Yeah, I guess he makes music.

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:03.823
He makes songs, too?

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.725
Oh, my god,
are they pedophile songs?

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:07.594
Is it all songs
about fucking kids?

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:09.028
Then they play you
Pretty Young Thing

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:10.729
and you're like oh,
it's right there.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.164
Yeah, dude, if you saw
it backwards

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:13.366
it would look a lot different.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.834
I think it might have been B.J.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:18.671
Novak, but early in me
doing comedy in New York,

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:21.240
he had a joke he did
at Caroline's one night.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.808
I think it was him.

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:26.012
But he goes, "You know,
Michael Jackson ...

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.514
If you really read between
the lines of the music,

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:30.416
the information was all there.

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:33.086
For instance,
there's a song called

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:37.323
Bad in which the lyrics state,
"I'm bad.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:43.730
I'm bad. I'm really, really bad.
You know it. I'm bad."

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.333
That's really fucking funny.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.568
Shane O'Gillis joins the show.

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:52.338
Oh, look at all keto-ed.
Are you all skinny now?

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.039
He does look like
he lost weight, dude.

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.409
Hi.
Did you drop a few?

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.614
You know what?
Go over next to Jay 'cause-

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.816
Did you drop a few L-Bs, dude?

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:04.884
Little bit, yeah.

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:06.185
He's getting thin.
Hell, yeah.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.586
He's single white female-ing me.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:08.888
He's gonna start wearing
wrestling shirts.

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:11.624
No sugar, no booze? Wow.

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:12.625
No booze?

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:14.794
Tons of booze.

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:15.928
A bunch of booze, dude.

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:17.230
What do you think,
I'm fucking soft?

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:18.965
Fucked up dude.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.666
I'm saying, you lost it.

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:23.068
You don't have the fire you had
when you were down in Philly.

00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:24.437
I still have the fire.

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:26.172
I remember seeing you sleeping
on couches,

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:28.240
drinking, eating carbs.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.743
I blacked out and fucked on an
air mattress this week, dude.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:31.911
Aw.

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:33.412
Who you talking to?

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:34.580
What?
Shane's still got it.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.748
Who you talking to?

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:38.083
What a gangster.
What a gangster.

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:39.352
Our resident hype man.

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:40.586
Dude which one of you guys
ate pussy

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:42.321
on a air mattress this week?

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:43.789
I was gonna say-
This guy did.

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.258
I'd have to go back to '07.

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.792
I dare you to fucking say
I lost it.

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:49.962
I literally ate pussy.
I was watching-

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:52.031
Wat it when you moved your elbow
and the mattress moves

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.267
in a different way
when you're eating pussy.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:55.434
Sorry.

00:03:55.434 --> 00:03:57.970
I was watching Losers,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.639
that's what I was afraid
of the whole time.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.608
I was watching Loser on Netflix
with one eye.

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:04.176
Great show. Wait you're side
eyeing Netflix?

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:06.879
Eating pussy with the other eye
and worried about busting

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.514
through a mattress
the entire time.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:10.249
Oh shit Shane have you met
my daughter. Unrelated.

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:11.617
Yeah we've met.

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:12.918
Unrelated though. Unrelated.
Jesus Christ.

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:14.220
Unrelated.
Yeah what a horrific intro.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.921
Unrelated though. Unrelated.

00:04:15.921 --> 00:04:17.823
Dude that's so great that
she's just blocked by the camera

00:04:17.823 --> 00:04:19.492
and Shane comes in he goes,
"Fuck and I'm getting hammered

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:21.594
just munching box
on air mattresses.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:22.962
That's my 16 year
old daughter there.

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:24.430
There's a kid here?

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.198
Oh no I pointed her out because
she's the only other person

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:28.635
in this room who's ever eaten
pussy on a air mattress.

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:31.837
Also that's Jay's
parents behind me.

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:33.105
Jesus Christ.

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:35.875
Both also guilty of eating pussy
on an air mattress.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.380
Hello Mr. and Mrs. Big.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.816
Are the phone lines lighting up
with questions for my mother?

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:46.953
The answer is no.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.087
You watched ...
No.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:50.756
No. You watched all of
Leaving Neverland?

00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:52.225
I did.
You watched both parts.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.393
I did.

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:54.594
Okay.

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:56.194
Did you watch the Oprah
after show?

00:04:56.194 --> 00:04:57.496
Did not.
Me either.

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:59.065
Did you go to Wade Robson's
house

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:00.533
and wait outside to talk to him
and get his opinion on it?

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:02.201
Would have dude.
Wade's pretty hot.

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:03.869
Dude any moves he glides.

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:05.304
Yeah he's the one for sure.

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:06.839
He definitely fucks really well.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.207
Oh my god.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.476
The one thing you know is that
if you're molested

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:11.978
by Michael Jackson
you've got moves.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.512
Yeah the Safechuck kid
came off-

00:05:13.512 --> 00:05:14.780
[crosstalk 00:05:17].
The Safechuck kid-

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.115
You fucking do it.
You're like ah.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.883
Yeah the Safechuck kid
comes off clunky,

00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:19.118
but Wade Robson's got the rhythm
you know what I mean?

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.519
Yeah.

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:21.954
That kids gonna throwback
into it probably.

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:23.855
Seven to 14 you're not around
for seven years

00:05:23.855 --> 00:05:25.825
I think Safechucks
a little bitter

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.293
'cause he got bounced quick.
He didn't get the franchise tag.

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:28.894
I didn't like the way
Safechuck handled it.

00:05:28.894 --> 00:05:31.196
By the way disclaimer
none of this is cool.

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:32.431
I'm just saying-

00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:34.100
Oh absolutely.
In the grand scheme.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.834
He's an absolute monster.
Michael Jackson is a monster.

00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:37.403
I'm getting into his head
right now

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:39.105
and I'm thinking how I would go.
You know what I mean?

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:40.706
Oh you'd go.

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:42.642
Yeah Robson's gonna take over
then he got the little

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:44.109
Dominican kid who was just-

00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:45.878
But he sued quick.
He flipped for money right?

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:47.513
Was that the one
that flipped for money?

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:50.349
Yeah. Just when Michael Jackson
trusted him enough

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.385
to finally have sex with him
this kid flips on him.

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:54.854
"Oh you broke my heart."

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.623
He kisses him like Fredo.
"You broke my heart."

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.458
"I gave you so many toys
and rides."

00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:00.626
"Oh man."

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:02.495
"I even licked your butt hole."

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:03.863
"I never licked butt hole."

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.397
And then Safechuck goes,
"Wait a second."

00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:06.999
"That's not even my thing."

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:08.633
That is your thing.
That's his move he licks butt.

00:06:08.633 --> 00:06:10.336
And he went like this.

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:13.171
Then they're crying
to each other.

00:06:13.171 --> 00:06:14.006
Dude the Wade Robson.

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:17.476
It's team-

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:18.911
I was watching that
and I learned me

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:22.815
and MJ have very similar
sexual moves though. Like-

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.283
I though you were
gonna say appetites.

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:25.484
I was about to. I was about to.

00:06:25.484 --> 00:06:26.853
He was about to say appetites.

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:28.487
Dude Shane rubs a lot
near movie theaters.

00:06:28.487 --> 00:06:29.922
No we have the same moves.

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:31.758
When I meet a girl
for the first couple months

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.893
I make her
sit at the end of my bed.

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.561
I spread cheek and I jerk off.

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.196
And you lean
against the headboard.

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:39.865
And then eventually I get the
courage to go in for a rim job.

00:06:40.332 --> 00:06:43.035
Just a little lick. She goes,
"Shane's trusting me."

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:46.205
When a horse gives you a hoof.

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:49.442
He does a petting zoo lick.
He goes, "Oh look, oh."

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:50.643
"He's trusting you now."

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:52.244
It's finally here.

00:06:52.244 --> 00:06:55.581
"He's melding with you.
He's melding with you now."

00:06:57.516 --> 00:06:59.685
I'm gonna make a change.

00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:02.454
Do you think when that
Safechuck kid and Wade Robson

00:07:02.454 --> 00:07:03.922
got together as adults

00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:05.724
they were still
a little bit hurt in their heart

00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:07.326
or trying to one-upmanship
where he was like-

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:08.694
Yeah definitely.

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:09.761
He goes, "He came over
and started licking

00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:11.363
my butt on the bed."
He goes,

00:07:11.363 --> 00:07:12.798
"He said he didn't really
do that for anybody else."

00:07:12.798 --> 00:07:14.433
And then that
Safechuck kid goes,

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:17.136
"Yeah dude he told me that too."
He goes, "Fuck. I just thought

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:18.937
that I was a little bit special
in some way."

00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:21.007
Or they find out that one thing
is different where Wade Robson-

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:23.609
"He said I was the best dancer
he's ever seen at that age."

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:25.411
He goes, "He told me
I was the best dancer."

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:26.745
"He was probably lying to you."

00:07:26.745 --> 00:07:28.381
"Yeah you're not even
a real dancer.

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:29.982
I'm trained professional.
I trained Brittney Spears."

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:31.383
Damn they should have
a West Side Story

00:07:31.383 --> 00:07:32.551
of all the kids
that he fucked.

00:07:32.551 --> 00:07:33.986
Dude that be-

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:35.821
Just like a dance off.
Who's better at dancing?

00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:38.858
You got served with
all Michael Jackson moves.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:42.428
Of all victims.

00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:43.896
A victims dance off.

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:46.899
Or the estate versus
the victims in a dance off.

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:48.934
We all knew something
was happening,

00:07:48.934 --> 00:07:50.503
none of us knew
how sinister it was,

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:53.406
but how didn't we when we saw
that he made them dress

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:56.408
just like him and then walked
holding their hands everywhere.

00:07:56.808 --> 00:07:58.143
I do that to my girlfriends.

00:07:58.143 --> 00:07:59.612
They wear wrestling T-shirts
and hoodies.

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:00.946
Oh that's great dude I hope
you make

00:08:00.946 --> 00:08:02.148
your girlfriends dress
exactly like you.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.916
Actually Claire was wearing,
oh fuck,

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:06.752
Claire was wearing a fucking
sheets camo the other day.

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:08.921
Yeah, but you that's been
early in the game.

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:10.622
I groomed them. I groomed.
Yeah.

00:08:10.622 --> 00:08:12.858
You're like [inaudible 00:08:11]
from Abducted In Plain Sight.

00:08:12.858 --> 00:08:14.126
Yeah she's afraid.

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:16.361
Zip, zorp you like sheets.
Zip zorp.

00:08:16.361 --> 00:08:18.263
She thinks the aliens
are gonna destroy the Earth

00:08:18.263 --> 00:08:19.865
if she doesn't
wear stuff like you.

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:22.001
Claire's crying, oh man,
baby girls crying.

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.435
That's fine. Claire's fine
who gives a fuck.

00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:24.970
She's crying to her sister
she's like,

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.505
"The aliens said
they'll murder you."

00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:28.808
She's like,
"Bring that shit."

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:30.743
Bring that shit
I'll fuck me them aliens.

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:32.144
Her sister's like,

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:34.113
"The fucking Earth's flat
so who cares."

00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:38.784
Can you say that-
Cat's out of the bag dude.

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:40.185
Cats out of the bag.

00:08:40.185 --> 00:08:41.787
My girlfriend's sister
is a flat-Earther.

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:45.291
Shut up dude. Shut up.
Genuine?

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.226
Yeah no-

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:51.830
What's her one sentence quote?
You broke Corey.

00:08:52.597 --> 00:08:57.236
What's your one sentence quote
on what her thing is?

00:08:57.836 --> 00:08:59.639
I've never seen it be round?

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.774
Shit. All right
I'm already in this hole.

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:04.209
You'll be fine.
You'll be fine dude.

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:05.444
This is a safe space.

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:06.846
This is not a safe space.
If she thinks your-

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.114
This is the opposite
of a safe space.

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:09.448
This is Comedy Central
and the radio.

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:10.649
[crosstalk 00:09:11]

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:11.918
You're gonna R Kelly it.

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.352
"Is that thing on?
Is that thing on?"

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:14.586
"How stupid would I be."

00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:16.055
If she thinks the Earth
is flat dude,

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.456
if she thinks the Earth's flat
she definitely

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:19.258
doesn't know how
to operate satellite radio.

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:21.460
Oh no this is not bringing back
to her

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.629
he's worried about getting back,
you get in trouble with the-

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:24.963
Whole thing.
It's a girlfriend fight.

00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:26.332
This is definitely [crosstalk
00:09:27]-

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.066
People don't realize that
with comedy

00:09:28.066 --> 00:09:29.568
sometimes it's
Jay you've got a good place.

00:09:29.568 --> 00:09:32.304
You just let it fly, but
sometimes you get in trouble.

00:09:32.304 --> 00:09:34.106
I haven't got in trouble
with this current one.

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:36.142
The past ones have been like,
"Did you,"

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:38.110
well the wealthy girl was like,

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.845
"Did you just shit on me
on your show?"

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.314
And I was like,
"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:42.915
Yeah.

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.817
Yeah. You broke my heart.
What you think I was gonna do?

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:47.152
You hurt me and I have a
microphone in front of my face.

00:09:47.152 --> 00:09:50.255
I will retaliate by any means
necessary.

00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:52.124
You have to make my love
into a comedy bit?

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.126
Sorry Jacob.

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:55.728
See we broke Jacob's heart.
But yeah-

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:57.062
Sorry Jacob.

00:09:57.062 --> 00:09:58.397
We'll get back
to Michael Jackson,

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:00.432
but this just solidifies
that you need to come in

00:10:00.432 --> 00:10:03.269
when we do a pre-record of
Beyond the Earth. Or-

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.503
Beyond the Curve.

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:05.837
Beyond the Curve.

00:10:05.837 --> 00:10:07.172
Which is a documentary
on Netflix about-

00:10:07.172 --> 00:10:08.640
About flat-Earthers.
Flat-Earthers. Man.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.808
Go watch that.

00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:12.244
They are, every situation
you know

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:15.114
I like
that my step-father's here

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:17.482
this is something very instilled
in me by him.

00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:18.884
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:21.153
When I first got a tattoo
when I was younger

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.788
and I have a bunch
of tattoos now.

00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:24.390
I like tattoos, however,

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.859
his point from the get go
was smart.

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:28.160
When I got a tattoo he goes,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.662
"Why don't you just
get in shape?

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:31.163
Whatever it is
you're trying to do

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:33.798
with that tattoo could be solved
if you were in shape."

00:10:33.798 --> 00:10:35.100
And everything I see-

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.869
Yeah. That's a great
piece of advice.

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:38.137
When I watched the documentary

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:40.106
about the Alt-right
and the Antifa-

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:41.339
Yeah.

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:44.109
Polar opposite sides
the answer to all of that

00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:47.413
is just like why don't you guys
just get laid or something man.

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:49.882
If you're going to flat
Earth conventions.

00:10:50.415 --> 00:10:51.984
Just I don't know man
get plastic surgery

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.552
before you do that and try
to make your face different.

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:55.253
We're gonna-

00:10:55.253 --> 00:10:56.822
Fix the problem that's here
is that you have nothing to do

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:59.258
so you're gonna be
flat-Earth clocks.

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:00.993
The thing I find
the fucking funniest

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.128
is that the scientists
are so right

00:11:03.128 --> 00:11:04.763
that they just feel bad
for the people.

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:05.965
They're like-

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.499
Let 'em have it.

00:11:07.499 --> 00:11:09.435
Yeah they really are.
They're like, "God bless.

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:11.336
If that's what you think you're
not gonna get into science.

00:11:11.336 --> 00:11:13.172
You're not gonna ...
You know what I mean?

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:15.340
Well it's almost my thing
with the flat-Earther too I go,

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.244
"You believe there's a big
conspiracy to cover up what?"

00:11:19.244 --> 00:11:21.313
I take the information
if they go,

00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:24.049
"You know we've been lied
to forever. The Earth is flat."

00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:29.488
I go, "Okay," I go,
"So my big dream of sailing

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:34.192
from fucking Atlantic City
to fucking Los Angeles

00:11:34.192 --> 00:11:36.195
via going around the world
isn't gonna happen?

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.563
Well shit.
All right."

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:39.465
Wait do you understand
how the world works?

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:42.034
Yeah I was gonna go around it.

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:45.237
Still flat or not you
can still do that.

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:46.505
No.

00:11:46.505 --> 00:11:47.806
You can't sail from-

00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:49.041
No you can't go-
Atlantic City to ...

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.442
Of course you can.

00:11:50.442 --> 00:11:52.178
You go around it though
I'm saying to go around.

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:55.246
No matter what to sail
from Atlantic City to LA

00:11:55.246 --> 00:11:58.384
you would just have to go
through the Panama Canal.

00:11:58.384 --> 00:11:59.585
Okay.
No, no I-

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:01.353
He's saying go the long way.

00:12:01.353 --> 00:12:02.854
I understand what you're saying.
I'm talking the scenic route.

00:12:02.854 --> 00:12:04.056
Down?
You're saying down-

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.490
Down South America?

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.625
Yeah South America.

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:07.859
Flat or round that still works.

00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:09.261
But he's saying go east.

00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:10.463
You guys are doing a poor job
of debunking-

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:11.931
I'm saying, I'm not.

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:13.265
I'm not debunking nothing.
This still works.

00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:14.900
Atlantic City.
Atlantic City Los Angeles.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.401
I'm taking a flight.
I'm already there.

00:12:16.401 --> 00:12:18.670
I'm talking about going this way
to come around it.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.306
If it's flat Earth
that wouldn't work.

00:12:22.607 --> 00:12:24.142
You'd go off the edge.

00:12:24.142 --> 00:12:25.944
I think you guys just made
a flat-Earther out of me.

00:12:25.944 --> 00:12:27.979
You go off the edge.

00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:29.414
Yeah you just sail,
no dude.

00:12:29.414 --> 00:12:30.815
If you're
a flat-Earther call in.

00:12:30.815 --> 00:12:32.952
My girlfriend's sister call in.

00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:34.953
Did she tell you to your face
that she thinks

00:12:34.953 --> 00:12:37.923
the Earth is flat?
You had a conversation with her?

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:39.258
I did not. It's secondhand.

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:40.759
Is she all about it though?

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.527
So I'm abusing someone's trust
right now.

00:12:42.527 --> 00:12:43.728
Is she all about it?

00:12:43.728 --> 00:12:45.430
Fuck it.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.965
We're talking about Michael
Jackson so it's on point.

00:12:46.965 --> 00:12:48.433
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
It is kind of like ...

00:12:48.433 --> 00:12:49.502
She's combative.

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:51.002
Oh really?
I think. She'll get you.

00:12:51.002 --> 00:12:52.171
Hang on the flat-Earther-

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:53.672
Sarah [McPants 00:12:53] saying,

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:55.708
"The flat-Earth Netflix doc
made me yell more than

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:58.744
Abducted In Plain Sight
and Leaving Neverland combined."

00:12:58.744 --> 00:13:00.379
Yeah it's a rough watch.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:01.613
That's why we're gonna do
a whole episode on it.

00:13:01.613 --> 00:13:02.982
It is a rough watch,

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:04.083
but I want one of those
clocks the guy makes.

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:05.417
We'll get one.
Yeah.

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:06.518
You got a birthday.

00:13:06.518 --> 00:13:08.020
Yeah the guy makes
good flat-Earth clocks.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.554
You got a birthday
almost a year away.

00:13:09.554 --> 00:13:12.525
Yeah. I want one so bad.
Yeah it's pretty ridiculous.

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:16.662
Back to Leaving Neverland
what I want to bring up today

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:20.298
was after watching this
documentary you're like,

00:13:20.298 --> 00:13:24.003
"Who defends Michael Jackson?
Besides his family?"

00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:27.072
That turns out
is Wendy Williams.

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.974
Black lady you want
to speak up on this?

00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:30.342
You want to speak up on this?

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:31.910
[inaudible 00:13:31]
already got rid of MJ.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.145
He said he's done with him.

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.413
[inaudible 00:13:33]
got rid of MJ?

00:13:34.413 --> 00:13:35.847
How 'bout R Kelly?
Who?

00:13:35.847 --> 00:13:37.082
We're gonna get
to R Kelly later.

00:13:37.082 --> 00:13:38.516
You know exactly
who the fuck that is.

00:13:38.516 --> 00:13:41.319
His names Robert Kelly.
His name is Robert Kelly.

00:13:41.319 --> 00:13:43.956
Michael Jackson accusers
how you doing?

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:46.425
What's up. How you doing?

00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:47.626
How you doing?

00:13:47.626 --> 00:13:50.129
Wendy Williams really
is a carved up freak.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:54.266
Can you bring up the clip
that you sent us Christine?

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.970
Wait 'till you see ...
Now Christine you said

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.771
you think she's playing devil's
advocate in this clip?

00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:02.174
It looks like Wendy Williams
dug up Michael Jackson

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:03.708
and took his face
and put it on her face.

00:14:03.708 --> 00:14:07.246
She Faced Off Michael Jackson.
Look at her crazy eyes.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.615
I want you to take his face off.

00:14:10.615 --> 00:14:12.150
Off. How you doing.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.419
How you doing. She's like,
"So how you doing?"

00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:15.588
"How you doing?Does it
look scary?"

00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:19.190
You have it?

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.161
I have it yeah, yeah. Here.
So this is-

00:14:22.594 --> 00:14:23.829
Look at her face.

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:25.063
Oh my god dude.

00:14:25.063 --> 00:14:26.665
She put Michael Jackson's
face on.

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:28.133
I haven't seen her in a while
she's terrifying.

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:29.701
She's just this guy on the show
with her

00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:31.336
has just
explained to her

00:14:31.336 --> 00:14:33.672
basically like a synopsis
of the documentary

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:34.940
and this is her reaction.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.575
Wait that straight guy
said something?

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:38.410
Yeah. Well first he was talking
about how much pussy he gets.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.845
That definitely straight guy?

00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:41.012
Oh the guy wearing-

00:14:41.012 --> 00:14:42.347
Before he even talks.

00:14:42.347 --> 00:14:43.816
The guy wearing a hound
tooth legging suit.

00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:45.751
Timmy said that Michael said
this was a first person-

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:48.087
I don't believe a word
of anything in this documentary.

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:49.455
Okay. Okay.

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:51.257
Okay Wendy.

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:53.691
That's like Michael Jackson
in the audience clapping.

00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:55.060
That is the greatest,

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.395
"Oh you think
he was gonna go that side?"

00:14:57.395 --> 00:14:59.631
I swear to you I was about
to say the words, I go,

00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:01.500
"How could they be
clapping for oh ..."

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.467
Yeah.

00:15:02.467 --> 00:15:03.835
Guys dressed like
Sergeant Pepper.

00:15:03.835 --> 00:15:05.404
[crosstalk 00:15:04]

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:07.539
They really do. They dress
like fucking Dominican warlords.

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:10.075
I don't know is
he in the FAU band?

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:13.078
Why is he ...
Is he gonna drum line?

00:15:13.745 --> 00:15:17.082
Okay what's up.

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:19.685
Ah, okay. What's up.

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:22.821
It's a trick daddy performance
on Wendy Williams.

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:27.626
He just comes out late.
"Aha what's up. Shut up."

00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:29.361
To the victims. Shut up.

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.196
Yeah.
They are a hot couple.

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:32.864
"To the little boys
that got fucked. Shut up."

00:15:32.864 --> 00:15:34.333
"Shut up."

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:36.268
Michael had a makeshift wedding
where they exchange vows

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:37.802
and put down
little vows on paper

00:15:37.802 --> 00:15:39.705
and said they're gonna
be together forever.

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:41.173
Also another guy-

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:42.307
She's not listening
to a thing he's saying.

00:15:42.307 --> 00:15:43.775
I know.

00:15:43.775 --> 00:15:45.510
She's just waiting to talk.
You can see it in her face.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.179
She's like mm-hmm
(affirmative) okay here we go.

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:48.513
I know and all I'd be thinking
is this guys

00:15:48.513 --> 00:15:49.715
talking with sheer
jealousy in his voice.

00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:50.716
Mm-hmm
(affirmative).

00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:51.950
Bought him all the clothes.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.418
Told him to shop
for whatever he wants.

00:15:53.418 --> 00:15:54.619
He took out the box of jewelry
and at that point

00:15:54.619 --> 00:15:56.421
I knew it was real.

00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:58.656
No one buys a rock like that
for someone they're not banging.

00:15:58.656 --> 00:16:00.859
He goes, "your balls
deep you're buying a ring."

00:16:01.827 --> 00:16:03.995
Shit or get off the pot Mike.
You know what I'm saying.

00:16:03.995 --> 00:16:05.364
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:16:05.364 --> 00:16:06.698
Do enough ding ding
get the wedding ring.

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.034
Make this kid an honest woman
already.

00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:10.468
Oh yeah.

00:16:10.468 --> 00:16:11.803
When she went to her
plastic surgeon and said,

00:16:11.803 --> 00:16:14.072
"Can you give me
a permanent skeptical face?"

00:16:14.072 --> 00:16:16.408
Yeah. Or she went,
"Can I look a little,

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:19.078
can you make me look
a little like a lion?

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:20.713
Just like a touch of lion?"

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:24.049
Even if she was agreeing with
him her face is always like.

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:25.383
She's got permanent diss face.

00:16:25.383 --> 00:16:30.455
Really? Really?
Really? Really?

00:16:30.455 --> 00:16:33.192
It looks like she just prowls
on the edge of the stage

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:35.094
and then stops.

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:41.667
She's a large cat.
Look at that.

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:43.334
See if her eyes
follow the mouse moving.

00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:50.809
The queen of the jungle.
Pure apex predator.

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.844
How you doing? How you doing?

00:16:52.844 --> 00:16:54.179
How you doing?

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:56.348
Someone leave
that small gazelle behind.

00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:59.385
If I was king of the talk show.

00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:01.920
Oh let me at 'em.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.122
These white people
reluctantly like, "Oh fuck."

00:17:04.122 --> 00:17:05.824
Is the camera on us?

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:07.425
Yeah you don't want to get
jumped at the end of the show

00:17:07.425 --> 00:17:09.027
by Wendy Williams
fucking audience

00:17:09.027 --> 00:17:11.062
and a guy dress
like Michael Jackson

00:17:11.062 --> 00:17:12.631
Beat It.

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:16.168
This is black people's
flat-Earth. It really is.

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:17.936
They got R Kelly and MJ
we got flat-Earth.

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:20.205
Hey did R Kelly and Michael
Jackson ever work together?

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:21.439
They did didn't they?

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:23.175
Oh man could you imagine
those parties?

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:25.577
I'll tell you-
Must be under 13 to ride.

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:28.380
Imagine those trailer
talks in between things.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.083
He goes, "I got a guy.
I got another guy."

00:17:32.617 --> 00:17:34.586
Just child trafficking
fucking numbers.

00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:36.321
"Does he have a sister."
Yeah.

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:38.256
Remember R Kelly wrote,
"You are not alone."

00:17:38.256 --> 00:17:40.259
And he told one of the girls
that he molested

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:42.327
that allegedly
that it was about her.

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.495
That he wrote that
for Michael Jackson.

00:17:44.495 --> 00:17:45.930
I don't know if there's
actually something

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.766
where they sang together,
but that was a hit.

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:49.635
Yeah it was.

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:51.236
Yeah no for sure.

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:52.504
Great song.
Back to Wendy Williams.

00:17:52.504 --> 00:17:54.172
Now he's got no money.

00:17:54.639 --> 00:17:57.342
Yeah got arrested today.
We'll get to R Kelly.

00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:59.511
[crosstalk 00:17:58]
One pedophile at a time.

00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:00.979
Jo Jackson, rest in peace, is-

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:02.881
This is my favorite part.
This my favorite part.

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.884
Fucking go back two seconds
'cause this is batshit crazy.

00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:08.053
Jo Jackson is a piece of shit.

00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:11.556
Like certifiable hunk of garbage
and watch what she says.

00:18:11.556 --> 00:18:12.991
This is nuts.
This is nuts.

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:14.325
And I've been around long enough

00:18:14.325 --> 00:18:16.028
I believe that Jo Jackson,
rest in peace,

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:19.598
he did the best that he could
in raising this show biz family.

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.166
Michael became
the star of the family

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:22.333
and even when he had all the-

00:18:22.333 --> 00:18:23.969
Pause it. What the fuck?

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:26.271
He did the best he could?
He abused those kids-

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:27.872
Could he have done better?

00:18:27.872 --> 00:18:29.174
I don't think so if Jackson 5
was the fucking best.

00:18:29.174 --> 00:18:30.408
I doubt it.

00:18:30.408 --> 00:18:32.144
That's top shelf abuse.

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:33.812
My dad did okay and we didn't
come up with any fucking hits.

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:34.980
I'll tell you what man-

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.148
How hard did you get hit though?

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:37.316
I got fucked up.

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:38.717
You got fucked up
?

00:18:38.717 --> 00:18:40.152
Yeah.

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:41.953
Well where were you and your
sisters choreographing moves?

00:18:41.953 --> 00:18:44.856
My only sadness is that Tito,
Jermaine, Randy and Marlon

00:18:44.856 --> 00:18:46.792
will never know
the sweet beauty of being

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:49.528
so famous young boys
are just giving you their butts.

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:51.896
Yeah. He goes, "Man I wish.
I walked through a mall

00:18:51.896 --> 00:18:53.932
and I'm like I just wish
I was Michael for once."

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:57.102
"Yo I had to get a van.
I had to make up some lies."

00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:58.904
He goes, "I had to create aliens

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:01.172
and then give 'em pills
to fall asleep

00:19:01.172 --> 00:19:02.841
and say that we were captive."

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:04.075
If you were getting ...

00:19:04.075 --> 00:19:07.279
If a captive sex slave child
to Marlon Jackson

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:09.747
and then you find out he's
Marlon Jackson at night time

00:19:09.747 --> 00:19:11.783
when you go to bed in your
weird cave he puts you in.

00:19:11.783 --> 00:19:13.251
Yeah.

00:19:13.251 --> 00:19:14.953
Would a part of you still go,
"I mean I would trade all this

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.454
if I was just getting
molested by Michael Jackson.

00:19:16.454 --> 00:19:17.822
It's so much better."

00:19:17.822 --> 00:19:18.891
You want to fuck up.

00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:22.160
Yeah you get Abducted
In Plain Sight

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.361
by the wrong
Jackson.

00:19:23.361 --> 00:19:25.797
Yeah I got Tito'd. Oh man.

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:28.300
"Oh man that sucks.
Did you get to see Neverland?"

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.735
"No. He's not
even allowed to go."

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:31.536
No you know where
we live Torrance.

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:36.808
He goes, "I had to drive out to
Torrance and it was brutal man.

00:19:38.209 --> 00:19:39.811
Guy had an above
ground hot tub.

00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:41.546
They don't even have a Ralphs
out there.

00:19:41.546 --> 00:19:42.914
There's nowhere to shop.

00:19:42.914 --> 00:19:44.483
You can't swim in an above
ground hot tub.

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:45.917
You just can soak.

00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:47.952
I'm pretty sure
it's only for athletes,

00:19:47.952 --> 00:19:52.424
but Tito real hand
to mouth out in Torrance.

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:55.593
"How's Neverland?"

00:19:55.593 --> 00:19:56.928
You go, "We ate all the candy
we could.

00:19:56.928 --> 00:19:59.298
I mean sure there was some sex,
but mostly fun."

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.334
You go, "I had to work
in his real estate firm

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:03.601
for six months."

00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:04.936
I interned.
I interned.

00:20:04.936 --> 00:20:06.672
I fucking interned over there.
For Tito.

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:08.473
Jo Jackson. When Jo Jackson died

00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:10.375
he was always going through
a really windy tunnel.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:13.611
He had like that
fucking wind burn face.

00:20:13.611 --> 00:20:15.013
Permanent
head out of fucking car.

00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:16.481
"My boy wouldn't do something
like that.

00:20:16.481 --> 00:20:18.283
I'd beat all the gay
out of him."

00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:21.486
He also has inter-city Latina
eyebrows.

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:22.921
Like drawn on where it's like,

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:24.656
"What's you talking
about stupid?"

00:20:24.656 --> 00:20:26.157
Like he's a cholla?

00:20:26.157 --> 00:20:28.327
Yeah he's like, "Yeah well
that's because

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:33.465
Michael ain't as talented
as Big Sleepy or Little Joker."

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:36.001
The Australian mom is the worst,
is the least likable.

00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:38.203
The Australian brother
is the most likable.

00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:39.371
Who Shane? Yeah.

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:40.638
Is that his name?

00:20:40.638 --> 00:20:42.006
Yeah.
Yeah he was great.

00:20:42.006 --> 00:20:43.475
The cop.

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:48.246
But we were sitting outside
was that Wade Robson

00:20:48.246 --> 00:20:51.249
is the guy,
allegedly, and I think-

00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:52.717
Stephanie
Falconi says it's fact.

00:20:52.717 --> 00:20:54.285
I think it's been confirmed
is he's the guy

00:20:54.285 --> 00:20:56.087
who banged Brittney Spears

00:20:56.087 --> 00:20:58.156
which broke up Brittney
Spears and Justin Timberlake

00:20:58.156 --> 00:21:00.626
and then Justin Timberlake
made the Cry Me a River song.

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:01.759
Yeah.

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:03.127
And all we were doing outside
was making

00:21:03.127 --> 00:21:04.596
if he subtly made the Cry

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.064
Me a River lyrics
just about making fun of Wade

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:08.032
Robson getting boofed
by Michael Jackson.

00:21:08.032 --> 00:21:09.567
Yeah if all of it was like

00:21:09.567 --> 00:21:11.269
if Justin Timberlake
was like new and he's like,

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:12.637
"Oh you want to
fuck my girl huh?

00:21:12.637 --> 00:21:15.439
I just heard
that you got butt fucked by,

00:21:15.439 --> 00:21:17.508
the prince
of the king of pop.

00:21:17.508 --> 00:21:18.943
And then you came
on his stomach.

00:21:18.943 --> 00:21:20.012
Oh."

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:23.715
Hey. It was making us
laugh so hard.

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:26.017
And then Wade hears
the song he's like,

00:21:26.017 --> 00:21:27.452
"Dude what the fuck man?"

00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:28.486
That's a little harsh.
That's harsh.

00:21:28.486 --> 00:21:29.821
First you he kissed your lips.

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:32.223
You twist his nips.
He fucked your butt.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.693
And tongued your hole.
Hey.

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:36.995
Got left behind
for MaCaulay Culkin.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.598
And you were Home Alone.

00:21:40.598 --> 00:21:41.967
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.302
Then he held your hand
sent your parents away.

00:21:44.302 --> 00:21:47.439
They cotton candy off your dick.
Hey.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.342
I have no problem
leaving him alone at all.

00:21:51.342 --> 00:21:53.411
Five days is nothing.

00:21:53.411 --> 00:21:54.680
I love it.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.948
Wait outside when
he was a baby boy.

00:21:56.948 --> 00:21:58.750
"Your son's gonna hang here
with me

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.552
and I'm gonna have a limousine
take you far far away.

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:01.820
See you when you get back."

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.488
"Are you familiar
with escape rooms?

00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:05.557
They'll be big in 30 years.

00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:07.892
I'm gonna put you
in a hard real one."

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:09.861
"Oops did I pull this book.

00:22:09.861 --> 00:22:11.663
Your parents fell
behind a trap door.

00:22:12.397 --> 00:22:15.266
It's okay they're being tickled
by clowns for two hours."

00:22:15.266 --> 00:22:18.336
"Oh no was that just a pit
of sticks under that carpet?

00:22:19.203 --> 00:22:21.072
Parents shouldn't
have walked there."

00:22:21.072 --> 00:22:23.341
"I guess there was no floor
under that carpet at all."

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:26.712
He's just sitting at his desk
he goes, "You chose poorly."

00:22:28.546 --> 00:22:30.181
You said the parents walk
over a carpet

00:22:30.181 --> 00:22:32.984
that just sends them
on a slide down 15 levels.

00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:35.420
"Oh no now you're with
the other 35 families."

00:22:36.087 --> 00:22:38.857
"What's up you got a cute kid?
Yeah me too. Me too."

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:40.491
"Did he dress like him?
Dance like him?"

00:22:40.491 --> 00:22:41.893
"Oh man he loves that."

00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:43.094
Right in.

00:22:43.094 --> 00:22:44.295
"He loves that."
Yeah.

00:22:45.062 --> 00:22:46.964
"I can't help but think
that we fed 'em right to him.

00:22:46.964 --> 00:22:48.666
Anyway they drop down
pretty good food

00:22:48.666 --> 00:22:51.136
at the end of the night.
The feed here's not bad."

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:52.570
"Oh the meat bags

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.038
that they throw down
are pretty well seasoned."

00:22:54.038 --> 00:22:55.573
"You know being in a sex
predators dungeon

00:22:55.573 --> 00:22:56.775
it could be worse."

00:22:56.775 --> 00:22:58.210
It could be.
Could be in Chicago.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.946
You can be in a R Kelly
sex dungeon. Take Neverland.

00:23:01.946 --> 00:23:04.382
The shittiest thing in the world
about Michael Jackson

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:06.718
being the person
who molest and rapes you

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:09.521
when you're a child
is you absolutely have to go,

00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:11.489
"Real quick question
though guys?

00:23:11.489 --> 00:23:13.090
Could it have been worse?"

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.959
Yeah it could've been
worse I guess.

00:23:14.959 --> 00:23:18.263
Dude I could show you, yeah.
"This right here is Frank."

00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:19.898
They show like a guy from local.

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:22.334
"This is Frank Barney.
He's an electrician.

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:24.102
He'll suck your dick in his van

00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:26.304
and then punch you in the head
so you forget."

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:28.406
You can't sue him
'cause he has nothing.

00:23:28.406 --> 00:23:30.208
The guy literally
is off the grid.

00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:31.743
Jail would be an upgrade
for him.

00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:32.910
He can't wait to go to jail.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.278
This man's looking for shelter.

00:23:34.278 --> 00:23:35.112
Three hots and a cot.

00:23:35.579 --> 00:23:36.881
Three hots.

00:23:36.881 --> 00:23:38.517
We were watching it ...
I was watching it

00:23:38.517 --> 00:23:41.352
and it was like this family
got to hang out at Neverland.

00:23:41.886 --> 00:23:44.555
Dude I might take one
or two for my family

00:23:44.555 --> 00:23:45.924
to have a nice vacation.

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:47.225
Yeah.

00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:48.726
If Trish sat me down and did
one of those speeches

00:23:48.726 --> 00:23:49.895
where she grabbed
both my young shoulders.

00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:51.263
Really explained it to you.

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:52.597
My young shoulders and she went,

00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:56.200
"Dan dad's gone.
We can make up for it.

00:23:56.868 --> 00:23:58.670
You're not gonna have
to have sex with your butt."

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.838
"You want to live in a fucking
amusement park?

00:24:00.838 --> 00:24:02.507
Kiss a guy.
Kiss a guy you love."

00:24:02.507 --> 00:24:04.942
"You know when you go outside,
you know when you go out back

00:24:04.942 --> 00:24:07.746
and you see the back brick walls
broke down from a drunk driver.

00:24:07.746 --> 00:24:09.247
We wouldn't have to
see that anymore."

00:24:09.247 --> 00:24:10.648
"Don't have to see that."

00:24:10.648 --> 00:24:12.284
"You just got to suck
an adult size penis."

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:16.121
"You just have to make love."
"To a guy you really care about.

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.823
Hulk Hogan."

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:21.426
"Oh brother I want you
to come down to Tampa.

00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:22.694
You can oil me up.
I'm like cool."

00:24:24.128 --> 00:24:25.197
Yes.

00:24:25.197 --> 00:24:28.066
Let's finish up
this Wendy Williams

00:24:28.066 --> 00:24:29.300
back at Michael Jackson.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.568
How you doing?

00:24:30.568 --> 00:24:32.303
Well you know I'm all right.

00:24:32.303 --> 00:24:34.339
Not well she doesn't need
to hear this.

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:35.807
That's great.

00:24:35.807 --> 00:24:37.709
She said Michael Jackson's mom's
not well.

00:24:37.709 --> 00:24:39.377
She doesn't need to hear this.

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:41.279
That's interesting because
Latoya Jackson's thing

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:43.648
that she said she was forced
into it or whatever.

00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:46.183
She claimed the mom
was well aware.

00:24:46.183 --> 00:24:48.920
Just said it makes
the whole family complicit.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.656
Just garbage.
Just bad people.

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:53.158
Gary, Indiana heard
ain't a great place.

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:55.126
No.
I've not heard good things.

00:24:55.126 --> 00:24:56.427
No it's a shithole. I've driven
through there a couple times.

00:24:56.427 --> 00:24:57.562
Yeah?
Yeah.

00:24:57.562 --> 00:24:58.996
It is a shithole right?

00:24:58.996 --> 00:25:00.264
Yeah it's a bunch of sheds.
It really is.

00:25:00.264 --> 00:25:01.466
Gary, Indiana all sheds.

00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:02.834
Inside those sheds.

00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:04.602
You know what's weird you
just saying

00:25:04.602 --> 00:25:06.037
that I'm kind of like I see it.

00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:08.173
It's literally a flat land
of just sheds

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:10.041
and then inside those sheds
are kids

00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:11.809
getting the shit
beat out of 'em dancing well.

00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:13.912
I was gonna say.
Yeah future kings of pop.

00:25:13.912 --> 00:25:16.781
If you want to see a show
go to Gary, Indiana talent show.

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:18.382
Getting ready
to get blown away.

00:25:18.382 --> 00:25:20.652
What's going on in that barn?
That barn is bumping.

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:26.291
You open it up.
Holy shit.

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:27.792
You want to shit.

00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:30.161
If you have the first
week off in May you go to Gary,

00:25:30.161 --> 00:25:32.130
Indiana they do
a fucking talent show

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.631
that'll knock your dick good.

00:25:33.631 --> 00:25:35.166
How good was it?

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:37.168
I don't know good enough
that I would let him rape kids.

00:25:37.168 --> 00:25:38.937
And I still be like
that's pretty good shit.

00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:40.271
You know what admission is?

00:25:40.271 --> 00:25:43.341
One kid.
That's the toll it's not money.

00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:44.642
How talented was it?

00:25:44.642 --> 00:25:46.111
Almost forgivable
that he fucks kids.

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:47.712
I'm still bobbing my head
when I hear it.

00:25:47.712 --> 00:25:49.113
Oh my god.
Damn.

00:25:49.113 --> 00:25:50.281
Wow. Wow.

00:25:50.281 --> 00:25:51.816
Guy was talented.

00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:53.384
In that shed that's where
they created all that.

00:25:53.384 --> 00:25:55.053
I say for sure yes,

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:57.922
but now I don't know
it's moving a little bit slow,

00:25:57.922 --> 00:26:00.926
but does this end his legacy?
I mean is it ...

00:26:02.527 --> 00:26:03.828
He's definitely-

00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:05.063
Does radio not play anymore?

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:06.497
It might be a mortal wound.

00:26:06.497 --> 00:26:11.169
Buddy when I was in the airport
last night in LAX

00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:14.839
wherever the Jet Blue terminal,
terminal five one of the bars

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:17.474
up there just has it's like
a Nirvana picture

00:26:17.474 --> 00:26:20.578
and one of them prominent
in the front of the place

00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:21.746
is Michael Jackson
Bad.

00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:23.214
Yeah.
It's the album-

00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:24.449
I know which terminal
you're talking about.

00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:25.617
Terminal-
Five.

00:26:25.617 --> 00:26:26.817
Yeah.
Terminal five.

00:26:26.817 --> 00:26:28.252
For the Delta at LAX.

00:26:28.252 --> 00:26:29.788
Yes. They have a Michael
it's a bunch of like-

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:32.156
It's a big old album covers.

00:26:32.156 --> 00:26:34.159
And it's a big old
Michael Jackson Bad

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:37.328
and I'm like man do you have
to like, listen we played

00:26:37.328 --> 00:26:40.098
Human Nature on the show
yesterday coming back

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:42.500
and it's a great song.
I don't know same thing man-

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.767
Cosby shows-

00:26:43.767 --> 00:26:45.369
Cosby shows those
are still funny.

00:26:45.369 --> 00:26:47.071
What a dilemma to be in.

00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:49.106
It really doesn't discount
their work it just means like-

00:26:49.106 --> 00:26:51.743
Boondock Saints is great.
Weinstein's a monster,

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:53.210
but Boondock Saints
is a fun movie.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:56.247
Boondock Saints does not hold up
as a white trash

00:26:56.247 --> 00:26:58.850
Irish American that's supposed
to be like my fucking go to.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.351
Yeah it's supposed to be-

00:27:00.351 --> 00:27:01.753
Boondock Saints stinks.

00:27:01.753 --> 00:27:03.487
That's the dumb mans
Good Will Hunting.

00:27:03.487 --> 00:27:04.723
Yeah. That's our Departed.

00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:06.458
Yeah.

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:09.026
Yeah they speak every language
that's we wrote it in there.

00:27:09.026 --> 00:27:10.261
And yet it doesn't hold up.

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.663
I haven't seen it
in a long time.

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:12.997
No Boondock Saints
fucking sucks.

00:27:13.498 --> 00:27:15.133
Unfortunately.

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:16.734
You're gonna have a lot of your
own kind coming after you.

00:27:16.734 --> 00:27:17.969
Coming after me.

00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:19.170
Did you like it
when you were younger?

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:20.805
Yeah. I don't think it holds up.

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:22.306
There's gonna be a lot
of four leaf clover

00:27:22.306 --> 00:27:24.175
in the Twitter handles.
Talking shit.

00:27:25.142 --> 00:27:26.411
Real nice.

00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:28.046
Oh on the eve of Saint
Patty's Day too dude.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.881
Coming down-

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:31.149
Is tomorrow Saint Patty's Day?

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:32.717
No but you know
what I mean it's close.

00:27:32.717 --> 00:27:33.951
It's March 17th.

00:27:33.951 --> 00:27:35.320
It's pretty close.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.654
It's 11 days away.

00:27:36.654 --> 00:27:37.855
'Cause we're in March.

00:27:37.855 --> 00:27:39.724
Yes if it was fucking December

00:27:39.724 --> 00:27:42.159
whatever and I was shitting
on Christmas you'd be like-

00:27:42.159 --> 00:27:43.895
That was a test. You are Irish
American white trash.

00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:45.463
Yeah it is.

00:27:45.463 --> 00:27:47.031
I didn't know you celebrate
Saint Patty's Day

00:27:47.031 --> 00:27:48.632
like a black girl celebrates
her birthday.

00:27:48.632 --> 00:27:50.935
Yeah she goes, "It's Saint
Patty's Day month."

00:27:50.935 --> 00:27:52.637
"It's Saint Patty's
month y'all."

00:27:53.104 --> 00:27:54.905
"Oh green beer all month."

00:27:54.905 --> 00:27:57.541
"Hell yeah get me an Incredible
Hulk a thug pass

00:27:58.008 --> 00:27:59.110
and put a little green
in my Corona."

00:27:59.877 --> 00:28:01.112
Dude yeah.

00:28:01.112 --> 00:28:02.280
You guys gonna make fun
of my culture?

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.681
Yeah.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:28:03.681 --> 00:28:04.883
Is that what we're doing?

00:28:04.883 --> 00:28:06.284
Absolutely.
How you doing?

00:28:06.284 --> 00:28:07.251
How you doing?

00:28:07.251 --> 00:28:08.753
But I don't believe any of this.

00:28:08.753 --> 00:28:10.388
I do believe this is money
for the families

00:28:10.388 --> 00:28:13.992
and I do believe that Michael
was having a problem with drugs.

00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:15.459
These fancy doctors
who will come to your house

00:28:15.459 --> 00:28:16.861
3:00 in the morning
5:00 in the morning.

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:18.262
Give you whatever you want.

00:28:18.262 --> 00:28:20.064
She goes, "You're on
top of the world.

00:28:20.064 --> 00:28:23.634
You have the freshest butt hole
laid out like it is sushi."

00:28:23.634 --> 00:28:25.103
Allegedly.
"Allegedly.

00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:26.771
And you are able
to please yourself.

00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:28.472
I'm sorry I do not see.

00:28:28.472 --> 00:28:30.008
This is not his fault at all.
This is the doctor's fault.

00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:31.542
Hairless. Void of wrinkles.

00:28:31.542 --> 00:28:33.111
I mean.

00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:35.179
I mean just a flush surface
with a hole in the middle.

00:28:35.179 --> 00:28:37.548
Bounce a quarter
off the actual butthole.

00:28:37.548 --> 00:28:38.917
That's how juicy it is.

00:28:38.917 --> 00:28:40.584
Just a seven year flesh light
right there.

00:28:40.584 --> 00:28:43.187
I mean looks like a pencil
sharpener in a wall.

00:28:43.187 --> 00:28:45.623
Grown from the Earth.
That's a natural flesh light.

00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:48.293
There's a flesh light walked,
started dancing like you.

00:28:48.293 --> 00:28:49.694
Started wanting to
hang out with you.

00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:51.462
All right bring it in here.

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:53.297
Oh dude if you guys came over-

00:28:53.297 --> 00:28:54.932
Dude if some little kid
came up he's like,

00:28:54.932 --> 00:28:57.468
"Hey oh yeah
it's the macho man."

00:28:57.468 --> 00:28:58.636
I'd be like whoa.

00:28:58.636 --> 00:29:00.170
I should just do it.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:02.306
I should've just done it,
but the next time Dan-

00:29:02.306 --> 00:29:03.775
Goddamn why do I like you
so much?

00:29:03.775 --> 00:29:05.209
The next time Dan comes over

00:29:05.209 --> 00:29:06.778
I should put a knuckle glove
on my flesh light.

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:10.915
Yeah so funny it be like,
"Oh finally we can be together."

00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:12.717
I go, "Oh Jay this is weird man.

00:29:12.717 --> 00:29:16.053
What I don't care it's like the
flesh light wants to be like me.

00:29:16.053 --> 00:29:24.963
I'm just mentoring it."
