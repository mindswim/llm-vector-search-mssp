a problem with which was a legitimate

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.819

just did what I usually do he just like

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.090
came up with a wild theory based on no

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.009
evidences be like dude no for real you

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.099
got to see this so that's what was going

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.629
on it was roughest time it was wrong

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:32.310
[ __ ] time dude everyone [ __ ] do

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.349
pilot on it was funny too because people

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:35.729
were like it's not that bad

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.800
I saw a Sid Sid posted a video of him

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.690
like naked crawling out of a tank I knew

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.389
I had to get back yeah boys look I can't

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.620
leave you alone you get you need you

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.990
need some negative feedback because of

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.240
you because Tim and [ __ ] Sid just

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.580
they're on board oh yes all three you

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.520
were on the same trajectory you meet

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.750
someone back there like now don't do

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.120
that don't do that tamper net yeah take

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.610
it out the tank was a solid move oh I

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.089
like that I saw this is this is scary

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:08.009
show hustle hey need it was scary what

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.229
was scary about it cuz then I thought

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.729
about him having to set up the camera

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.500
and press record and then climb back in

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.150
and then climb back out I thought but

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.949
early did it for him at first well that

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:21.930
would be no it was it was he said the

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.900
cam slithered out went back in slow

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.610
they're back it was it was fun man yeah

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.490
yeah we had a good old time what the in

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.649
cell F I was like never again dude

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:36.750
because it does require pushback of

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.830
being like well what about this or what

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.080

they're not [ __ ] around they're

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.560
serious so then you get like trolls who

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.479
are like [ __ ] that guy dude he's like

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:14.000
when people listen to them even did say

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.080
he's like you know I get it you guys

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.699
[ __ ] around it's not the same thing but

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.440
it was the same argument but these guys

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.460
aren't [ __ ] around so yeah some I

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.990
mean dude there are some dark corners of

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.120
the internet dude so you know either way

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.440
the only reason I deleted it so spud

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.210
didn't like it the spud man didn't like

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.009
he didn't like it did wasn't spud half

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:34.009
in so he well he's he can't claim

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:36.830
himself he's not a virgin and not that

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.389
long ago that's what that was what I was

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:40.520
talking about on the thing I'm like dude

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.139
it sucks like if you if you had the

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:43.909
terminology for me when I was younger I

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:45.319
would like [ __ ] a man in cell because I

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:46.940
would go like nine-month stretches oh

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.090
yeah and then it's like now that that

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.469
wasn't a thing I was always like I'll

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:53.000
get [ __ ] eventually but now it's like

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.319
you go on these message boards you're

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:57.319
like wait what am i [ __ ] yeah it's like

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:59.719
especially for like a 19 year old

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:01.729
nine months or take nine months and I

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:03.560
getting [ __ ] is an eternity you just

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.240
had to be a [ __ ] liar true you had to

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.669
be a [ __ ] liar you just had to reverse

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:13.159
eyelid move he had to resort to [ __ ]

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.060
lying that's the only way to survive

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.400
that stretch Sidney had a good theory

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.979
actually a good point saying that like

00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:20.479
being in himself so on it's so

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:21.860
unacceptable in the black community it's

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.330
not a thing he's like I think it's the

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.860
fact that white guys don't try to get

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.509
posting hard enough like they don't cat

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:28.639
cat callings out of the picture so he's

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:29.930
like it's really white guy's fault they

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.659
like this thing exists yeah it's also

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.669
the you know I think the rules are a

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.709
little harsher on the white guys when it

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:39.250
comes to cat corn and all that and also

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.300
we're the only ones you can call excuse

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.550
me I'm gonna put a man that right spin

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.899
this right now white guys are the main

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.250
culprits of catcalling we've established

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.699
that yeah but also obviously also I'll

00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:52.700
say this and this isn't I think it's

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.500
more socially acceptable for black guys

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.420
when they're younger definitely to just

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.790
[ __ ] whoever like white guys if you

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.430
[ __ ] ugly chick you're gonna hear

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.160
about it I do I don't know though cuz I

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.740
don't I partied as hard as I could I I'd

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.290
had you know no shame no shame I grew

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.270
out of my shame yeah but I there were

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.350
definitely some chicks I hooked up with

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.760
that I was like you [ __ ] don't tell

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.800
anybody about definitely like that dude

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.270
I've said it before that was my favorite

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.370
thing to do in college when people pull

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.780
up Facebook like damn look at this

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.490
chicken [ __ ] she's so hot I would go for

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.250
like my oddity collection but yo I'll

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.590
give you like what the [ __ ] I'm like

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:32.660
dude she's [ __ ] hot I like it but not

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.300
here we're saying maybe this is the fat

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.680
you're talking they're gone in fast and

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.350
loose yeah his point theory it's like

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.910
you have to be able like we were talking

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.440
about how you basically like yeah if

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.940
you're not wearing all the same color

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.410
matching clothes like you just you're

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.910
not trying hard enough to true you'll

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.710
have an all red [ __ ] outfit dude it's

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.700
like of course you're not getting [ __ ]

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.240
dude oh yeah so the yeah that was

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.980
something I was like I got to stay more

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.960
conscious during these things someone's

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.150
doing something I'm like wait no rather

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.190
than being like okay yeah whatever I

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.770
could see that yeah but yeah it was I

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:07.730
think you're being too hard on yourself

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.360
I didn't listen the episode but wasn't

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.380
bad okay

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.420
I mean it was the thesis was [ __ ]

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.220
there's a weak thesis that's all but

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.840
yeah it was funny it was it was so funny

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.370
to see people what the [ __ ] I feel bad

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.840
for the guy now he's probably like

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.000
second guessing like oh no I called him

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.290

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.600
there was a story in the Toronto scene

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.480
that kind of rules there was a

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.360
transgendered woman yeah that was like

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.010
very vote I think vocal against Louie

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.530
and was like very like controlled the

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.640
scene yeah with an iron dick just

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.680
bullying everybody with the [ __ ] like

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.080
there's not enough diversity on the show

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.420
that's things like well you suck that's

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.470
why you're not on the show

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.390

[ __ ] trans everyone's like farouq

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.750
farouq and then one day people like hey

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.650

into that true I do I will but see I

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.070
don't think I think most of the

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.170
transgender people are again this is a

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.630
wild speculative thoughts but I think

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.190
they're new I think they're new to the

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.990
game dude now the new school I think now

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.550
that now that it's being except now I

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.770
think they're new fool how about the new

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.800
fool I think now you know and there's

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.360
reasons for maybe because now it's way

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.310
more socially acceptable yeah you might

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.770
even argue socially rewarding but I

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.060
wouldn't make that I would never make

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.670
this assumption like that but yeah for

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.070
there's for now there's no Arius force

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.390
field around you I don't know if they

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.300

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.680
yeah like it turns out that that

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.810
transgender lady who is knocking broads

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.760

like I'm actually a woman sorry I'm yeah

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:19.640
in the process trapped in this body

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.660
technically that was just an even fight

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.670

my brother's Arabic dude I'm voting for

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.460
Sanders dude 100% I checked this dude

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.289
people are there's this guy on Twitter

00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:33.080
who was like little simple arithmetic

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.419
Bernie Sanders doesn't understand and it

00:29:35.419 --> 00:29:39.350
was like if you tax things 50% and like

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.610
you know if that person is making

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.770
$30,000 a year then you give them $15

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:45.230
minimum wage and then tax that at 50% it

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:46.460
puts that person back down and making

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.130
like like 9 bucks an hour but it was

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.710
like you don't tax until you hit the

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.570
specific bracket so yeah person's income

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.000
would be taxed at whatever was over that

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.350
and this guy's like a little simple

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:59.000

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.200
percent tax on over a hundred thousand

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.240
so if you made 120 you're gonna tax in

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.380
that twenty thousand yeah they're gonna

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.990
