jerk to lisa-ann which is yeah and it's

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.699
like old hands in general but just like

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.439
that [ __ ] freaks me out so buddy Blitzen

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.019
what Jersey like clicks in like there's

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.199
about like a lady in satin gloves and

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.630
she's like old she just [ __ ] jerks

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.130
people in satin gloves and sand gloves

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.129
you know these old I saw like like this

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.930
black lady that had like really long

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.840
nails but her nails were going through

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.739
the gloves

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.110
oh I have a sir I have a very certain

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.300
fetish for long nails glassing like a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.010
keyboard let's honks meow

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.660
do you ever watch the guys Marcia with

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.129
the nails uh-huh do you watch like the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.829
ASMR I don't know what that is yet it's

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.329
I mean you might actually especially

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.610
there are like people who do ones that

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.650
are specific to nails like tapping on

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.270
stuff but what it's really just to like

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.380
a pleasant like yeah yeah it's it's like

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.409
oh I think I'm gonna explain it poorly

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.030
but I think it's just like a technique

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.740
of like talking really softly and then

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.720
like like highlighting noises of like

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.409
activity so is to like kind of create

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.119
this euphoric sensation for your ears

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.430
really yeah I could probably get into

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.020
that it's kind of pleasant binaural

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.600
beats so I could probably get into like

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.040
it's kind of it's called ASMR yeah yeah

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.780
yeah I've heard of that I watched like

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.759
one video of a lady like combing her

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:57.270
hair one time yeah I know she's like I'm

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.420
so she was like I'm expressing my

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.920
feminine energy you know I was just like

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.509
I mean I'm happy you're doing this but I

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.390
just feel like a weirdo jerking off but

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.009
I'm like you back into it whenever

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.330
people were at they're like if I go to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.110
the bank and a lady's like

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.410
with nails boys more like an adder I'm

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.520
like more in and out as like

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.600
appreciating just like sex in general

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.380
yeah I was drunk

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.180

walking around with a bulge all day

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.280
being like damn I wish I had a big boy

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.050
like that guy yeah I like just thought

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.520
about him walking around and showing

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.959
people bulge all day and I'm like dude

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.350
yeah like if I don't jerk off for seven

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.000
days I get horny about like anything I'm

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.310
sure I'll see a bulge and be stoked on

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.630
it to the point for seven days since I

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.940
turned off for the first time I used to

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.320
be that's how I used to be man and now

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.510
easy that's how I used to be now it's

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.209
like I had this weird thing with porn

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.370

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.980
tried watching like I like read stuff

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.690
about how like evil the porn industry is

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.570
and I feel bad for like jerking off and

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.250
like I'm I'm addicted to pornography

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.320
like 100 percent yeah there's no way

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.720
like I've tried to stop and I literally

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.980

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.580
to one porn star that I watched which is

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.959
now a whole I haven't had like a crush

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.000
on a porn star since I was like really

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.920
young so now this is like kind of weird

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.549
territory again yeah I don't know hey

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.040
that's it's kind of like narrowing it

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.870
down it's kind of nice I feel like it is

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.310
I feel like you know the honor for her

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.730
for her and me and the other like

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.250
250,000 goes but yeah it's like I I

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.019
porn star in a while and it's nice to

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.340

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.299
exciting

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.010
I feel like I'm working my way back to

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.090
like wholesomeness this was like my

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.829
first step into porn was having crush on

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.900
certain porn stars and now like I've got

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.510
out of the orbit of just like scrolling

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.910
down and it yeah all right what's my

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.700

[ __ ] when I like going like porn sites

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.550
and Mac it looks like a comic book

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:24.530
it looks like villains in the comic book

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.350

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.150
don't like it so I just don't know it's

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.820
a such a weird thing to be like I need

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.950
another I need a dude to [ __ ] my girl

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.020

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.490
blowing your friend you're like I'm a

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.230
bisexual dude if you're like no I'm

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.170

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.580
my babe with me so I don't even

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.680
understand that I can't even put myself

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.510
in those bird I can't even I don't like

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:07.500
any of my friends that much yeah I think

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.060
we'd do the thing that I think there's a

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.670
competitiveness that kind of feels that

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.910
yeah and I would be like I bet you can't

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.220
[ __ ] like me exactly the front of me

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.660
yeah I would

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.730
cuz that dynamic has to arrive it rise

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.320
instantly or someone's like I'm taking

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.100
the back seat

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.470
yeah there's no way to people take the

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.750
reins on that like nah dude um no

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:37.110
they're just like dust and yeah yeah I

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.720
don't know that's too much I guess

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.510
psyched out you just like yeah I think

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.200
so

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.770
yeah I think I would I mean I would go

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.540
instantly limp and stand there and make

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.070
them acknowledge my limp bird for the

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:56.550
rest of the session around oh yeah man

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.150

had to plug in my laptop it's gonna die

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.330
dude I had to uh I had to do a reading

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.000
for school last week

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.330
the title of the reading like Moton mind

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.440
you most my readings are always like

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.930
like a multicultural approach to like

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.970
Volvo psychology whatever and it's like

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.530
you know multi-gender disciplinary

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.780
approach to this and that I opened up

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.700
the one the reading the other day

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.720
because it's like I opened them all up

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.920
and read the titles and see if I want to

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.260
read them or not I opened up the one and

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.900
it just said [ __ ] equals loser it was

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.310
like the first time I opened up a

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.600
reading for my school that I was like

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:40.180
okay what's this and it was literally it

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.250
was it's uh it was really good it was

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.980
funny it was a guy who was a sight he's

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.780
a psychotherapist and he's working with

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.970
a little kid and the kid had like

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.970
sibling rivalry issues or whatever but

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.530
while playing with the therapist the

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:54.760
therapist was like let's play this game

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.440
the key was like tell the kids like

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.640
let's play this game the therapist like

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.010
this games kind of like for older people

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.660
it might be a little much so the

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.340
therapist spanked this kid and it's just

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.660
like crushed him in this game just like

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.090
okay as he crossed the winning finish

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.830
line of whatever they're playing the kid

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.110
just went [ __ ] and then there the

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.390
therapist is gay so he was kind of like

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.550
he wrote a whole thing exploring like

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.010
why the little boys say that where does

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.720
it come from and he was like kind of

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.260
saying he they equate like the word

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.170
[ __ ] with smallness and losing oh wow

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.570
kid was constantly losing his older

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.710
brother would beat him up his older

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.970
brother was one who was calling him a

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.710
[ __ ] older brother was eight years older

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:33.940
than him he was like big and strong like

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.590
his dad and this kid identified more

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.180
this mom dude this guy like when in deep

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.250
but it was also like so I read the whole

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.230
thing and I'm like so I'm like the

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.670
bigness and winning and all this stuff

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.720
I'm like yeah that makes perfect sense

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.080
I'm like the author I was wondering like

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.480
the first reading I'm like dude did this

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.060
guy get called a [ __ ] and basically

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.790
write like a four thousand word essay I

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.410
wanted this kid was actually a [ __ ]

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.740
it's kind of it's kind like yeah I hear

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:00.850
you but here's all the kid was doing

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.010
he's preoccupied being a loser and

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.460
that's really high like I read the whole

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.930
thing cuz I read half an eye like oh my

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.040
god dude this dude just getting the

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.560
ultimate payback on his own kid but you

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.550
when you read it it's a lot more

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.050
in-depth that's not what the gentleman

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.630
was off to but at first reading I was

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.490
like this guy's just salty yeah yeah

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.800
salty but it was pretty funny he was

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.320
talking about the I can't stop thinking

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.100
about smallness and losing right now

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.590
Wow how like as a boy you constantly

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.110
identified with smallness and losing and

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.910
your whole life struggles to be big and

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.650
winning and they he was like that's

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.300
where it comes from and then he was

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.180
saying that's where it eventually morphs

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.120
into like the like the real he was like

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.620
talking about the ironic use of the word

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.390
versus like the like legitimate like I

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.100
hate gay people say things right he's

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.390
saying that's where it builds out ups

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.710
and you see gay people and as a boy

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.180
you're just kind of like I want to

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.830
[ __ ] win and be big and she gave her

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.410
bag oh yeah it kind of builds out of

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.470
this weird like cuz this is all like

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.850
like psychoanalytic perspective so I

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.350
took all this weird like Freudian stuff

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.730
I was talking like castration anxiety

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.550
and like the kid would steal like play

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.320
knives and like so he that was like his

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.820
phallic symbol because he was taking

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.590
like the fal the phallus was like the

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.140
male representation of like the penis

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.880
and he would like take that he was steal

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.110
a knife like a fake knife from his

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.190
therapist and he always wanted to play

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.080
with the bat did it was [ __ ] it was

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.150
weak so he would go to the therapist

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.560
like let's play a game he's a guy you're

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.060
gonna interview me I just won the World

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.040
Series the therapist would have to be

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.300
like oh how do you feel anything I'm

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.620
great I'm the winner

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:32.360
I just want crazy yeah and he was

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.980
probably like eight years old oh my god

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.640
his older brother must have his older

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.930
brother was eight years older than him

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.230
and apparently Jack tall total Chad the

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.630
dad was a total Chad oh my god it sounds

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:47.630
like you for a family pretty much it was

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.520
dominant daddy it was dominant daddy -

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.920
dude that just made me laugh so hard the

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.790
little eight-year-old lost a game what

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.850
the [ __ ] was that about yeah it's really

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.790
the essay was good actually

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.960
I'm obsessed now with smallness and

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.579
losing everything smallness of every

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:06.199
league interaction you have yeah are you

00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:08.480
like yeah everything are you tabulating

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.189
wins and losses are you just like aware

00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:12.320
of constantly what dude like I saw a

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.640
guy's huge bulge at the bus stop

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.439
instantly dude that's a nail for you

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:17.180
total [ __ ] nail really no I was

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.030
actually still we're in this together I

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.860
need to get some velour sweat pants

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.020
yes that's my I was wondering like what

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.870
is so if but and it's like the guy made

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.100
he made a bunch of points that I was a

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:31.910
gauri that's actually pretty

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.020
unassailable but the I wonder I'm like

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.970
what is his definition of smallness like

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:38.900
is the whole death

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.880
and then to transcend smallness and

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.160
losing is that the big and winning to be

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.710
like well I'm above that altogether well

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.620
yeah yes - yeah right so he's like I

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.020
guess he's writing from the perspective

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.630
outside the game where you can win and

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.160
lose just like pointing this out right

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.140
yeah it's also gotta be weird though for

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.630
Gators to watch like hetero boys in

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.360
development and be like damn dude these

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.140
guys are [ __ ] wild oh come like it do

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.400
to come through make on the [ __ ] you

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.960
know I'm in charge I'm the [ __ ] best

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.780
oh I don't know the story they story

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.850
itself was reading it was so funny just

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.590
to sit there and be like my first take

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.120
was just kind of like damn dude this guy

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.120
got the ultimate [ __ ] payback yeah

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.230
he's like this is why you're a [ __ ] for

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:26.510
color is it but is it TLDR because if it

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:32.780
is he is still too long didn't read it's

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.240
like I wrote this whole thing for to get

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.360
back at you yeah the kid you know okay

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:45.980
boomer yeah the dude it was funny it was

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.260
like I've never heard and I've always

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.550
heard like people be like well if you

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.480
say that kind of stuff you're just

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.420
secretly gay you're attack yeah he was

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.020
like this is just entrenched in male

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.660
psychology totally in terms of not

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.180
wanting to be a small loser and how as

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.740
boys will do anything they can to

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.240
disavow themselves from being a small

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:05.720
loser

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.060
yeah the word [ __ ] a projectile force

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.640
to project that onto another person so

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.170
you don't have to live with it well it's

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.370
true yeah I mean that's how I feel

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.290
what's the unassailable theory

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.450
yeah it's that thing it's like the total

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.880
counter if someone gets caught calling

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.200
someone a [ __ ] you can be like

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.450
smallness and losing dude you gotta work

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.640
with that yeah it is the ultimate cop

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.880
this dude one I mean yeah he did be

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.140
pretty bad he beat him at the game was

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.610
like well here's why your whole [ __ ]

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.890
perception of reality's [ __ ] up yeah

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.120
the little kid's gonna have to read it

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:39.650
one day Mike [ __ ] yeah that was like the

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.820
ultimate put-down when I was I mean

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:49.160
still pretty effective like totally like

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.100
that's the one yeah that's the that's

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:52.730
the

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.049
it's the red button on the that's

00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:59.690
spider-man's web dude hit with that like

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.600
I literally spent I for sure

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.809
adjusted my like major aspects of my

00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:08.150
personality and behavior to avoid being

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.650
called a [ __ ] by my older brothers and

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.160
cousins dude yeah there's 100% yeah I

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.429
have like things that I don't like now

00:20:15.429 --> 00:20:17.870
because I just like just then get like

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.120
music I'm like yeah and I always hate

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:25.549
the Beatles because of that like their

00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:26.809
haircuts and everything with like the

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:28.190

liked NSYNC when my little sister

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.160

Friday night I would like listen to that

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.650
in her room yeah I'd hear footsteps like

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.220
shut the table oh yes and it's be like

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.360

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.650

events thinking boy yes they were dude I

00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:09.620
read this article and I literally I

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.380
really did open it up and was like yeah

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.760
I was like what the [ __ ] is this I said

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.820
I mean it's a good hook

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.100
it's literally equal sign yet literally

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.179
it's pretty good

00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:22.510
Wow I read the whole thing today I feel

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.809
funny like a beautiful mind calculation

00:21:25.809 --> 00:21:30.590
chalkboard but yeah it was a

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:34.299
he's his total synopsis was one of like

00:21:34.299 --> 00:21:37.220
it's so it was saying basically like

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.600
Freud said that like male psychology is

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.299
just like at a bedrock level just like

00:21:44.299 --> 00:21:46.940
pure aggression pure libidinal libidinal

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.919
force that it was never examined because

00:21:48.919 --> 00:21:50.690
it was taken like that was the root of

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.220
it his whole thing was like it's time to

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.010
like wow dig deeper but he kind of goes

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:56.240
off into another tangent and I'm like

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.380
man I don't know if I really agree with

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.809
but I was like it's pretty crazy that he

00:21:59.809 --> 00:22:01.820
was just like that's it as a young boy

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.770
it's like you come up and

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.810
you're kind of like you you're scared

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.340
your dad's gonna like cut your [ __ ]

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.090
dong off

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.950
so you're just so you did I don't know

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.020
it's [ __ ] weird I might actually

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.810
that's it's castration anxiety so it's

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.100
kind of like it's not even like

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.780
literally but it's like you feel like

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.940
your dad has easily the biggest dong and

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.590
is in charge of everything yeah and you

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.810

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.040
dog we're pretty much the same you guys

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.630

00:26:53.259 --> 00:26:56.440
international DJ it's like yeah

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:04.600
asterisk paid $8,000 like crate of Tommy

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.750
Hilfiger they had some Tommy almost got

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.129
some Tommy Hill when I was there got

00:27:09.129 --> 00:27:10.840
Tommy great all isn't Disney out of

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.820
favor right now is used racist was he

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.559
yeah I forgot I heard that but I never

00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:16.629
heard like what he said I think he

00:27:16.629 --> 00:27:18.220
specifically said I don't want black

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.289
people wearing my clothes I think it was

00:27:20.289 --> 00:27:22.840
a pretty clear-cut case Tommy Hilfiger

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.110
damn it well his [ __ ] was the coolest I

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.789
was in grade school yeah and then like I

00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:30.460
think like he was like nine years behind

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.710
on that and I think he found out like 10

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:34.539
years later it's like wait what oh the

00:27:34.539 --> 00:27:36.220
people that it was like black people

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.710
love Tommy Hilfiger yeah that was like

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.240
the hottest in seventh grade if you had

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.009
Tommy Hill like you were definitely

00:27:42.009 --> 00:27:44.350
getting [ __ ] back then yeah right you

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:45.610
just get your hands on it and they had a

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:49.440
whole Tommy Hill section I almost like

00:27:49.799 --> 00:27:51.970
and I was like [ __ ] I just remember dude

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.340
he fell out of favor yeah oh yeah I

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.690
think I think I have to double check

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:57.580
when I think he specifically he was the

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.379
one who specifically it was like I do

00:27:59.379 --> 00:28:01.120
not want black people were that's the

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.730
one thing you can say to [ __ ] you over

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.559
like what else could he have said that

00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:07.149
mate would make black people not wear

00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:09.250
his clothes yeah exactly he was very

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.320
explicit yeah it's like I think it was

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.120
Tommy Hilfiger I think so cuz I think

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.149
also Gucci gun know Gucci see [ __ ]

00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:19.389
you're just running wild kinda they made

00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:21.669
that blackface like ski mask it was like

00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:26.559
boy it was like dude it was yeah the

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:28.299
Gucci thing let me see I think Tommy

00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:31.690
Hill he was the one who was just like he

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.000
was like I don't like I've seen what

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.070
they're doing and I I'm not for it

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:39.340
Wow so he was like that's like the wool

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.679
yeah that one's that one's bad I also

00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:42.880
wonder where he's from

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.330
tommy hilfiger yes he like from Europe I

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.700

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.580
like an American guy yeah it's gotten

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:53.960

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.130
America Dan they're from 96 dude that's

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.200
when you came out yeah

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.590
96 Hilfiger allegedly said that at the

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.000
phone lines he had known minorities were

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.350
gonna wear his clothes he wouldn't have

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.450
made them he wouldn't have made them

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.429
quote so nice and that he wished they

00:29:10.429 --> 00:29:11.929
wouldn't wear them and he went on Oprah

00:29:11.929 --> 00:29:14.179
and stood by those statements whoa Dan

00:29:14.179 --> 00:29:16.010
but apparently said of course none of

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.380
this is true he had never even been on

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.370
Oprah when the rumors had started so yo

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:24.380
he went on in 2007 he tried to put them

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:28.400

and they were bringing out on like

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.600

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.740
one plate toast on another plate

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:35.970
potatoes on another plate and it's like

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.920
I get this on one plate the guy would be

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:43.140

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.450

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:47.010
off of several plates I have eggs

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.690
over-easy and I'm trying to dip [ __ ] in

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.150
them and I'm like yeah feel like a

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.530
psychopath it's like Alice in Wonderland

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:03.510
Duke place it should be layered in like

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:04.610
a tea party kind of thing

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:07.890
everybody flavors of Britain know what

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:12.300

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.810
[ __ ] dumb girl it's a place a place

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:21.650
you pay $200 for dipping [ __ ] and cheese

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:24.750
yeah okay I've been to like you know

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.830
what's the other what's the other

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:30.390
melting pot I've been to a melting pot

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:34.140
my family got no Bigfoot I know that's

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.970
yeah that one the wheels came off on

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.740
that what happened I think just like

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.830
we're like let's not invite this one on

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:46.580
yeah and we did and sure enough

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.020
no not even it was like about you know

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.150
is about some family [ __ ] but it was

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:54.140
like what you guys invited me here so

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.970
let let this boiling pot of cheesy

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.870
service the mediator do you guys eat the

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:04.950
whole meal or people storm off we I

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.350
definitely I was fat then so I

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:14.610
definitely you were like hoping the it

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:17.960
would escalate so you can have more

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.110
building pot is the funniest thing yeah

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:29.420
I like yeah we like I haven't seen one

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.880
the one that happened I mean this is now

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.670
thinking about it's the

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.230
that did happen that went out of

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.320
business so I think we just I hope they

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.100
all go out of business

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.680
left a crater think the fight [ __ ]

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.230
ruined everyone having pot vibes just

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:47.270
dudes being extorted on like third dates

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:49.280
yeah although what dude I I it's the

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.340
only time I'd ever do on a third date am

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:54.650
I you know if I'm like actually [ __ ]

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.230
melting pot nothing hot for a date dude

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.840
there was maybe I'm a geezer dude but I

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.730
was like I remember there was a thing

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:04.970
we're like that spread around like what

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:06.410
someone I dated that became like the

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:08.390
thing that like they all had to do so

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:09.860
how did the melting pot like twice and I

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.200
was [ __ ] salty about it yeah but

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.760
actually I've done it early at high

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.440
school I brought a girl to flavors of

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.300
England same thing that in high school

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.710
though it's kind of flavors of England

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.900
was like a tea party that's kind of tiny

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:37.790
sandwiches 60 boxes I would picture the

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:41.170
Prince Andrew having sex with underage

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.920
that is still that's my favorite picture

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.900
I'm sorry I'm like I like geek out on

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.230
that picture of him and like the it's

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.230
the picture of him with the girl who's

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.750
underage and then Ghislaine Maxwell is

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:58.850
standing behind them it's like you might

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:00.980
as well Epstein could have been like put

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.840
this shirt on and shirt that just said I

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.790
[ __ ] teenagers no it's like purely like

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.250
this is like I'm setting you up also

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:13.010
it's like who's accidentally hanging out

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:15.260
with pedophile like well yeah we

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.030
chilling all the like we don't like you

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.500
don't I mean obviously we don't see eye

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.870
to eye on everything it's like you know

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.270
if someone's like your boy you know

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.000
they're having sex like a lot if they're

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.410
they're typically not keeping that to

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.510
themselves also so if their whole

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.100
business runs on inviting other people

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.350
onto their plane to have sex with other

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:33.890
people

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:36.350
you know what this guy's about if you're

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:38.960
hanging out with him and he has indeed

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.940
which apparently is proven it's like

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.340
beyond reasonable doubt at this point he

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.350
was indeed inviting people to fly on the

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.020
plane to have sex with underage girl

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.840
actually I'd never log there was there's

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.820
I mean if you agree with one that all

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.170
these victims came forward and we're

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.420
like hello there when you're like only

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.070
people multiple people came forward and

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:58.810
like this is what he was doing this what

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.600
was going on in like a lot of the [ __ ]

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.580
really does add up to like in like yeah

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.380
why was that girl she was 17 why was she

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.670
in a picture with it what the [ __ ] else

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.980
are they doing right and yeah it's so it

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.560
makes perfect [ __ ] sense yeah sounds

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.600
like how was it yeah how was he hanging

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.220
out it's like well you know we all kind

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.170
of mingle a little bit also Trump daddy

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:19.330
[ __ ] me this story about it's so

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.880
funny like just kind of hitched a ride

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:26.410
yeah downplay you know hitched a ride

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:27.700
would I chill with the staff the whole

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:33.880
time yeah yeah that's pretty that's what

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.800
he's danced around that pretty hard it's

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.270
also kind of bizarre he can kind of be

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.530
like well I mean yeah it's check

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:39.940
technically I was on the plane once but

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.380
like you know it was just business yeah

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.490
then again it was just once allegedly BC

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.530
rocked like I think like 16 times on

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:51.640
their BC don't cling I think like 16

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.690
times on their dude that 16 times is

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:56.590
crazy

00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.850
it's great that's so much yeah yes I got

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:04.540
fool me once thing maybe yeah yeah

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.790
16 times they're like I don't think I've

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:12.040
flown 16 times and I was definitely that

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.270
must be a while when those dudes thought

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.670
they're all getting away with that I

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:19.630
mean they say yeah they kind of did one

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:27.370
that makes it even better yeah I feel

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:29.830
like that's just more more like kind of

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:33.730
power to wield I was imagining Hillary

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.980
Clinton was like two crazy straws

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.420
sipping out of like the eyes of a

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:40.810
[ __ ] child's all right let's go on

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:42.340
we'll go on The Daily Show say these

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:46.680
rumors are ridiculous like on the plane

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:52.240
probably flight attendant let me pull it

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.290
up your correctly I'm talking about

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:56.130
[ __ ] children

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:00.750
and then I was about to say something I

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.090
mean just yeah like that would be funny

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.880
if it all was like gay 40 year old male

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:16.770
flight attendants on the episode like

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:18.450
the good sassy I'm thing they're doing

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:19.740
the [ __ ] demonstration they're like

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:22.040
rolling their eyes

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.180
curacy flight attendants argue on a

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.210
plane

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:28.680
I've seen them links I'd see them beef

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.180
before it's kind of really well yeah

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.850
that's tough yeah especially to put her

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.710
on the flight is exactly even for like a

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:35.970
three-hour flight I was I went to

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.370
Chicago and I saw a couple a little rift

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.440
between the two the one was kind of

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.510
bossing the other like the carts you

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:43.740
know like they have to synchronize that

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.270
cart thing how the ones coming up and

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:46.800
down oh yeah she basically made them

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.240
like turn around go back come back

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.730
oh it was kind of a big thing that is

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.530
yeah that turned into a thing I saw I

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:58.800
noticed it sit on a plane like yeah this

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:03.420
crew is so dysfunctional that's actually

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.700
kind of yeah I mean the more astute

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.070
observations I'm keen to paradigm exceed

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.470
do you sleep on planes or no no not at

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:15.530
all and if I think you're an Air Marshal

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:20.050
[Laughter]

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:29.700
they probably do think I'm an Air

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.650
Marshal damn

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:33.810
I might start stealing Air Marshal value

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:36.660
Valor you kind of you can have it I

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.460
could if I do like a button-down denim

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.080
tucked in it's like sit there and keep

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.550
like one hand on the hip the whole time

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:43.470
let me stay or like next time there's

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:46.710
turbulence big ma'am ma'am we're fine

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:54.060
trust me damn Wow yeah you're totally I

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.250
saw you in a bus station as an Air

00:43:56.250 --> 00:44:02.700
Marshal as a paid job yeah yeah I guess

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.640
no hero you just say you get a teaching

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.020
position you're sit in the very back

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.900
mm-hmm so then when someone tries to do

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.269
something it's just like Oh

pop Donham you know talk about tactical

00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:16.849
position yeah I should start getting on

00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:18.619
the plane now mister because we do

00:44:18.619 --> 00:44:20.209

sir please I'll put off sky marshal

00:44:49.189 --> 00:44:51.289
energies [ __ ] getting me very pumped

00:44:51.289 --> 00:44:52.969
right now yeah that's better than a

00:44:52.969 --> 00:44:56.119
bulging velour sweat pants pretty much I

00:44:56.119 --> 00:44:58.519
don't know man clothes I don't know just

00:44:58.519 --> 00:45:00.259
walking around all day it's dude was an

00:45:00.259 --> 00:45:02.479
absolute unit - he was like a short like

00:45:02.479 --> 00:45:05.719
kind of stocky big jack dude what color

00:45:05.719 --> 00:45:07.880
this my pants you see brown I'm gonna

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.249
say they were blue or brown I don't know

00:45:10.249 --> 00:45:11.089
just remember the bowl-o-drome

00:45:11.089 --> 00:45:23.299
colorblind how's your day going you know

00:45:23.299 --> 00:45:26.569
what now pretty good he was just on the

00:45:26.569 --> 00:45:28.880
street just now I'm fascinated by this

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.739
guy and he was kind of like hips out a

00:45:30.739 --> 00:45:32.179
little bit he was like sticking his head

00:45:32.179 --> 00:45:35.179
he knew yeah it wasn't it wasn't even

00:45:35.179 --> 00:45:38.149
like a like who was that Mark Wahlberg

00:45:38.149 --> 00:45:39.349
movie Boogie Nights it wasn't like a

00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:41.539
long kind of like trouser snake setup it

00:45:41.539 --> 00:45:43.669
was just like a [ __ ] unit it was just

00:45:43.669 --> 00:45:46.339
like a short fat boy popping out of this

00:45:46.339 --> 00:45:48.699
[ __ ] thing

00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:50.209
well that's like when you wear

00:45:50.209 --> 00:45:54.469
sweatpants like there's only one pair of

00:45:54.469 --> 00:45:56.149
sweatpants I've ever worn wear it I

00:45:56.149 --> 00:45:59.569
haven't been able to see my dick I mean

00:45:59.569 --> 00:46:01.279
like just cheap so our fans were just

00:46:01.279 --> 00:46:06.019
like oh my dick is that small yeah

00:46:06.019 --> 00:46:08.979
there's a button hidden in the front of

00:46:08.979 --> 00:46:12.079
my workout shorts show you exactly how

00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:15.429
small my dick is well I'm working out

00:46:15.429 --> 00:46:17.929
that's actually a good motivation kind

00:46:17.929 --> 00:46:20.739
of is tight to wear a belly shirts yeah

00:46:20.739 --> 00:46:23.950
I just show my [ __ ] Tina's - I

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:29.170
I think this is why I'm here yeah you

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:31.810
get a trainer just for your dick I have

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:33.190
seriously started like thinking about

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.839
now that I'm in like I'm waiting for my

00:46:34.839 --> 00:46:36.990
child I might start just like joking

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:40.630
because it is it is a pretty asexual

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:42.339
period of one's life a man's life

00:46:42.339 --> 00:46:43.930
how do you how do you gel can you

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:45.010
because I've been thinking about it cuz

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.599
you're you've introduced me to gel King

00:46:46.599 --> 00:46:49.030
and I've heard it on other shows and I

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:51.430
and like I'm like joking I have to

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:52.990
follow up it's probably been a lot more

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.670
advanced now yeah but it's basically

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:57.369
just - okay signs and you just see the

00:46:57.369 --> 00:46:59.650
idea is you want to pinch the base work

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.150
it up and as you're squeezing the very

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:02.710
top you pinch the base again and that

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:04.480
creates like a blood trap you're just

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.000
pulling your dog yeah it's like milking

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.740
that joking is the arabian word for

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.109
milking so you're kind of milking your

00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:13.300
dong so you're like pushing blood up and

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.859
then you squeeze the base and that

00:47:14.859 --> 00:47:17.650
creates a [ __ ] trap of blood and you

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:19.030
just go nice and easy

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:20.230
you got a warm up you got to put like a

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:22.750
wet a warm wet cloth on your bird like

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:32.250
warmed up looking like Joe Biden's eye

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.490
but yeah you know I like the other day

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.770
it was funny as I was jerking off today

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:41.380
I had Mohnish myself for not joking I

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:45.640
was like dude you're so [ __ ] weak oh

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.540
is it like I caught a very sensual

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:54.220
Vaseline B today hmm - my - my internet

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.760
your internet my yeah

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.609
Vaseline beats are kind of [ __ ] good

00:48:00.609 --> 00:48:03.700
treacherous the cleanup is probably just

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:07.030
nuts I don't like it spelled oh yes yeah

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:08.560
that's crazy I just like coming into a

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.060
sock I literally just throw the shock

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:13.060
and I'm just like it's amazing I'll say

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.680
as an adult the Vaseline beat doesn't

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.470
hold the same magic you did in my youth

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:20.260
yeah yeah I can see that but I will say

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.050
my hands not as my old decrepit skin

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:24.670
seems just soaked Vaseline and better

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:26.800
than I did before which is yeah it's a

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.410
double you're doing two things you're so

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:30.040
it is

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.329
I mean it's self-care and more ways than

00:48:31.329 --> 00:48:33.609
one true it's like you're it's

00:48:33.609 --> 00:48:35.020
wintertime my bird could use like a

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.470
little bit of a Polly your

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:39.109
same kind of Sheen right now I'm getting

00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:42.580
bad dry skin yeah

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:49.849
even dry bird I mean now it's well yeah

00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:51.890
you have a dry bird right now I mean

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:53.869
it's not like you know it's not it's not

00:48:53.869 --> 00:48:55.580
brittle but it's not flaking

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.950
no but it's a driver it can use

00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:58.820
hydration

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:02.210
really it could yeah I just feel like

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:07.340
you know it's like sometimes like you

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.010
need to see the Sun yeah never put your

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:11.599
dick you ever get Sun on your dick no

00:49:11.599 --> 00:49:14.720
dude when I had I mean when I thought I

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.220
had a ringworm on my dick which I holy

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:16.760
[ __ ] away

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.349
it was just thank God it was a skin

00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:20.300
irritation that I made worse by ringworm

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:20.990
medication

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:23.990
burn it oh [ __ ] dude I so they said that

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:27.650
ringworm thrives in dark environments so

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:29.540
when I was driving I would bird out oh

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:32.119
let my bird catch Sun was driving it's

00:49:32.119 --> 00:49:35.450
kind of nice that my way dude sunlight

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.400
on my bird it was like that was so wear

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.990
your pants like at your ankles at night

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:42.470
I've talked about pop Berta oh I kind of

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:43.970
perpetually wore gym shorts for the last

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:47.060
like four years so I flop it out chill

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:50.570
dad son like he pulled next people bird

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:53.180
away and a nice little spot it's pretty

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:56.270
like truckers fully just saw ya the

00:49:56.270 --> 00:50:04.760
first summer honestly positioning it in

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.910
little sunbeams that sounds it was nice

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:09.650
I kind of liked it out great it really

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:12.140
does sound great I mean I like kind of

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:13.460
its kind of shame we don't get to get

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.589
like Sun on our dicks at all yeah yeah

00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:18.800
the fact that our such a secret is kind

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:25.750
of weird yeah yeah it's kind of strange

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:28.490
because it's an immutable property of

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:29.960
your body I mean I guess let me unless

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.010
you start gelling like me you can

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:32.930
definitely get big results

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.930
so joking is like primarily to gain

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:39.589
length it's kind of like something well

00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:41.480
depending on how you jelq and while are

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.609
you talking soft gel card gel card gels

00:50:43.609 --> 00:50:46.010
more girth soft gels more lane

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:47.720
but again I think it's one of those

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.100
things like it's a constant it's like a

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:49.670
penis pump

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:51.140
you'd have to constantly be doing it

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.030
stopping your bird goes back so it's

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:54.380
like if it really worked I feel like

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.810
everybody would be doing it but you say

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:59.660
it does work I've done it before

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:02.390
I've done it before and I had the person

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.160
I was with was like what the [ __ ] ease

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.460
what's going on oh but I think it's like

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.200
you just get like super hard from

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.869
constantly edging yourself I'm finally

00:51:11.869 --> 00:51:13.880
like have sex you're just rocking like

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.859
the most insane [ __ ] bird

00:51:15.859 --> 00:51:19.430
damn so it does it I don't know I'm also

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:21.290
too I'm a bad source cuz it's like I

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:23.480
can't literally go work out like once

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.770
and I'm just [ __ ] like I'll be you

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:27.109
try yeah it's more of a mental thing you

00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:29.600
gel can you feel good oh you got you're

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.520
running like doing sit-up like you

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.960
didn't do anything to your body but

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:43.609
you're like wow it sounds hard I mean I

00:51:43.609 --> 00:51:44.900
think that's probably why people don't

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:47.570
do it a lot it's like it's a practice it

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:49.550
is practice and it's so hard to jelq and

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:52.340
then not jerk off yeah that's the thing

00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:55.340
it's like not everyone can do that yeah

00:51:55.340 --> 00:52:01.430
yeah no I can tell you I can't do that I

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:04.250
drove off every time afterwards it's

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:06.470
tough not to I feel that would that

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:08.359
would only add to it though it's pretty

00:52:08.359 --> 00:52:17.390
tight mi wrong with it there's a queue

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:20.600
where the K is typically in junk right

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:25.150
there's a queue yes it's job it's jlq

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:27.230
yes I'm telling you it's from the

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:30.580

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:43.430
around forever mm-hmm my brother told me

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:44.630
about it it said like it was like

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.310
something taken from like African tribes

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:48.770

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.600
was introduced to it by my brother being

00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.500
like nah dude this shit's legit

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:02.610
could you is there like if you got like

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:05.670

enough hands could you jelq a person

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:09.480
like an entire person to make them

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:17.060
taller do you think they made Yao Ming

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:25.140
Carrie Lam is unhappy with that I take

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:25.650
that back

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:30.440
yeah I want China money bad I mean well

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:34.500

I just see it's very political like in

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.760
the sense of like what is there to go

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.250
was it because of the because China has

00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:58.980

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.840

funny cuz like initially when I thought

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:38.300
of and maybe this is the case still

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:40.520
but at least with them it's like they

00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.740
were brainwashed clearly like just they

00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:44.900
were just all my YouTube I well that's

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:46.550
what I don't know I don't know how they

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:47.960
like they don't get into that like how

00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:50.180
they work on tactical eyes into Isis

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.460
from America I don't know I think it's

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:55.730
like Britain yeah I mean it's like

00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:59.210
what's it akin to here where like I'm

00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:00.290
pretty susceptible and like

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:02.300
impressionable yeah never for a second

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.130
was I like I don't know I think those

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:05.750
Isis guys it might be ah yeah exactly

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.580
right that's that's what I think it's

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.450
like and this is even weirder it's like

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:14.210
and this I think this is true a girl who

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:16.280
was like a little bit like a grade above

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.850
them yeah already kind of cool she's

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:22.370
older I think she was on her way to

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:24.530
being radicalized somehow I don't know

01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:27.710
how and then she like kind of past that

01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:29.180
she like kind of convinced them or she

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:32.120
was like you know she was walking in

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:40.400
with a head imagine the dad just like

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.260
it's just like dudes involved who are

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.250
like bringing how are they getting

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.860
radicalized and they like were they

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.870
dating dudes that like did this or

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:49.430
ladies like why do is like we're heading

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:51.290
over that's even that's even weirder I

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:52.580
mean I don't know how the marriages work

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.040
out but it's like they get there and I

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.070
think it's just like it's like okay well

01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:00.620
you are you're female so I could be

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:01.850
wrong with us but I'm under the

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:02.780
impression that it's like you're female

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.660
you're gonna marry one of these guys for

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.760
sure you're not allowed to like go there

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.720
and like now I'm gonna do my own thing

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.390
yeah I wonder that would because I know

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:13.780
everything

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.830
yeah I know I know I know in England

01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:20.630
it's like you know they have real

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:22.880
[ __ ] problems with that yeah

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.380
the Muslim pocket like don't go with

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.580
like Tommy Robinson will roll through

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:29.990
the Muslim population so I wonder if if

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.630
I don't know if this is a case but like

01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:34.130
one of them might have been like dating

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:36.170
like a Muslim dude and the dad was like

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:37.970
not in my house mom's like oh stop

01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:39.290
you're so old-fashioned and then like

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:41.180
she ran away and got her head chopped

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:45.920
off and he's like yeah he just happened

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.680
to be right in that case hold your

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.200
[ __ ] head chopped off well the crazy

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.240
yes

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.140
he's just right yeah every funny I mean

01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:59.420
it's probably yeah which is probably

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.310
frustrating with them though if there

01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:02.810
wasn't someone up in their ear being

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:05.000
like yo come here it has to be no way

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.400
they watched you tell me for you know

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.990
what were they for 15 year-olds

01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:10.400
obviously like an appropriateness were

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.950
they hot kind of I haven't seen in terms

01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:14.480
of if you were a 15 year old boy judging

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.790
them I haven't seen if you were a sheik

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:18.740
yes would you want these guys coming

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:21.530
through Oh see them you just yeah yeah

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.089
I'm just I don't really I don't think

01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:25.160
there's pictures ever since or 15

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:33.579
they're automatically hot yeah I got you

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:37.070
so they joined over there three got head

01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:40.280
heads lopped but actually even more

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.560
frustrating well I don't know if it's

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.119
yeah it is kind of frustrating because

01:02:44.119 --> 01:02:46.730
it's like it's it I think it's kind of

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:49.730
wide it's unfortunate either way but I

01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:51.250
think they were killed in airstrikes so

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:55.760
it's like neighbor any fire well why did

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.990
I just assume the other heads chopped

01:02:56.990 --> 01:03:02.869
off yeah because those feel off sneakers

01:03:02.869 --> 01:03:08.450
you're getting your head yeah at least

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:11.060
two of them did another one and then the

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.800
other one is like got hung from an

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:22.310
excavator the guy from an excavator it's

01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:25.040
the funny I'm crazy they just lift it up

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.900
they lift the Machine up holy [ __ ]

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:29.869
that's gruesome it's pretty it's some of

01:03:29.869 --> 01:03:31.609
it yeah this [ __ ] it's like the two

01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:34.660
girls got drone strike drone struck in

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.339
their drone stricken yeah I think so

01:03:37.339 --> 01:03:39.020
other one possibly got her head off we

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:42.050
can't confirm yeah and the other ones

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:43.670
still alive the other ones still alive

01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:46.160
and she's like at this point she was in

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:50.630
it's kind of there's it was kind of

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:52.310
funny to me because it's like at the

01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:55.250
point in which like the fight against

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:58.940
this like I said like just that where

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.890
they had like a stronghold when they

01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:03.050
were be it was beginning to slip she was

01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:05.359
kind of [ __ ] Isis and then she kind of

01:04:05.359 --> 01:04:05.869
like

01:04:05.869 --> 01:04:07.759
I did hear about someone try I read an

01:04:07.759 --> 01:04:08.930
article about some girl trying to be

01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:10.579
like let me back in it was my bed

01:04:10.579 --> 01:04:15.079
whoa like I chose oh maybe it is this

01:04:15.079 --> 01:04:18.789
person because it could be because she

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:21.380
she's from the UK and then she was

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:24.049
trying to get she's trying to get back

01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:25.969
she was like if you can get me back is

01:04:25.969 --> 01:04:28.369
she's had like a baby I'm she was like I

01:04:28.369 --> 01:04:30.229
just wanted I just want I know my people

01:04:30.229 --> 01:04:31.999
have like health care if I go back there

01:04:31.999 --> 01:04:33.769
and I just want him to be able to live

01:04:33.769 --> 01:04:37.039
her husband is dead right the thing and

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.539
I read in the New York Times the husband

01:04:38.539 --> 01:04:40.689
was definitely dead okay I don't know

01:04:40.689 --> 01:04:45.829
where this guy also this she got it like

01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:48.279
a shitty husband to this guy he was like

01:04:48.279 --> 01:04:51.079
in Isis jail for a little bit because he

01:04:51.079 --> 01:04:56.359
was spying yeah having is like what a

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:57.109
hundred years

01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:58.549
I don't know then they put him in Isis

01:04:58.549 --> 01:05:01.160
job before they met and then they're

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.829
like this is your husband and then she

01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:10.910
was like washing they married her to a

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:14.029
dude into Isis jail yeah but then he got

01:05:14.029 --> 01:05:17.650
he got out I think you know he proved

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:25.240
[Laughter]

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.219
also what is that like if you're an Isis

01:05:28.219 --> 01:05:29.900
and they're like here's his English

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:31.699
check I wonder if that's like thanks bro

01:05:31.699 --> 01:05:38.119
or kind of like an insult to be to give

01:05:38.119 --> 01:05:40.699
you the infidel to marry I don't know

01:05:40.699 --> 01:05:44.299
well she she is is she Muslim I think so

01:05:44.299 --> 01:05:46.420
use your white chick I don't think so

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.670
yeah that was I might be the Swedish

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:51.349
teens we just I'm getting I'm thinking

01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:55.309
yeah I'm thinking Swedish teens and dude

01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:57.109
that would piss me off so bad if my

01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:58.880
daughter ran away and joined Isis I'd

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.429
like what the [ __ ] that would bother me

01:06:01.429 --> 01:06:02.529
so badly

01:06:02.529 --> 01:06:06.709
yeah haven't you explained that Big O

01:06:06.709 --> 01:06:09.349
where's uh where's Rachel be like she

01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:13.849
joined Isis they murdered two of her

01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:15.559
friends and she's now trying to get back

01:06:15.559 --> 01:06:18.319
in it depending on how she was doing I

01:06:18.319 --> 01:06:19.250
would give

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.560
that up if she was like killing it but

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.060
they don't get to I don't think they

01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:23.990
really pretty they're kind of just like

01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:27.230
they like root for Isis which is it's

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:29.570
like let them in some of these ladies

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:33.380
can probably ball let them in hell no

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.870
bro if you [ __ ] place your bet on

01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:38.720
Isis obviously lost you can't come back

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.030
oh no no I don't mean let them in I mean

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:43.820
like for for them to participate in Isis

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:48.110
activity where they III get the sense

01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:49.400
that they can just stay on the sidelines

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.380
and it's like I don't know if they're

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.880
joining they might want to know what

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.680
you're like hiding bombs and [ __ ] for

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.180
them and stuff you can't [ __ ] come in

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:58.370
we should do oh yeah you can't come in

01:06:58.370 --> 01:07:00.440
we Mac we should reinstitute the

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.660
Australia kind of prisoner policy and

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:06.200
like send any Isis wife to Australia now

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.790
it was like a prisoners colony yeah yeah

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:10.160
or yeah or what are your views you hate

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.900
Isis don't you your sworn enemy yeah no

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:17.840
they're not cool dude Isis came in here

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:22.490
yeah they would like the Jew faced did

01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:28.310
you face cuties yeah Wow they or make

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:32.000
them just constantly be on MTV reality

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.850
show that will be tight it's like you

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:37.640
are now on love what's the show are you

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:41.480
the one yeah that show it might as well

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.660
be like a Flavor of Love style show yeah

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.460
and you're just you have to live here

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:49.930
forever over tell you and then like

01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:55.430
Shaun White yeah I'd be more curious

01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:57.140
like they should stop bombing them and

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.730
just fly drones so so I can like see

01:07:58.730 --> 01:08:04.400
what the [ __ ] see how they live in that

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.930
would be pretty tight just to watch that

01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:07.670
almost like you throw tokens like some

01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:09.230
dudes like tells his wife what time it

01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:18.350
is I'm gonna use that subsidy forbids

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:19.640
his wife from driving oh my dear that's

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.970
[ __ ] alpha dude that is alpha as [ __ ]

01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:25.759
yeah yeah and then yeah the kind of

01:08:25.759 --> 01:08:28.609
would function well then turn Isis in a

01:08:28.609 --> 01:08:31.670
bunch of kam boys pretty much unwilling

01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:32.930
Cowboys

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:37.870
wild that's I mean there was a getaway

01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:39.860
you cannot see this because they're

you don't know what happened with this

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.870
lady's uh well I know okay so I think

01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:32.160
it's some process because it takes years

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.620
but when the first story came out a

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:37.890
couple years ago like the Foreign

01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:39.570
Secretary or something revoked her

01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:43.680
citizenship to Britain and they're like

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.390
she's an Isis now she can't come back

01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:47.310
she can't come back did she make a post

01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:48.660
about it like why can't you go in

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:51.960
silence go join Isis but secretly and

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.550

01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:55.800
yeah really did she post like I'm [ __ ]

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.480
oh man I don't know I mean I guess she

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.620

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:02.730
guarantee it

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.040
there's no way they denied that that

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.990
opportunity to post that's a good post

01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:13.830
that's a lot of mad faces a lot of

01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:16.440

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.510

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:35.160
trying to like appeal to come back in

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.360

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:42.990
pretty much it's betting over here right

01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:44.400

true we thought that yeah also - it's

01:15:16.769 --> 01:15:18.389
definitely probably you're saying they

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:22.289

01:15:40.919 --> 01:15:42.869
as though born in London okay so they're

I always thought it was a really rich

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.020
family that paid for it and and they're

01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:47.590
you know that's you thought it was some

01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:53.440
greedy banker I really did think I was

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:55.360
like there has to be some like super

01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.190

how long did I stay forward how would it

01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:12.670
be possible for me to be like an illegal

01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:15.040
citizen so you can extend your trip and

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.080

soldier ladies another mystery this is

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.500
and I think this is I don't know is so

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:42.390
true but Netanyahu is he good at bad

01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:45.970

01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:59.560
in like crazy [ __ ] he he's won what what

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.900
like five terms in a row I think he's

01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:05.080
struggling right now to to really

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.420

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:15.880
of his well

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.230

01:26:17.230 --> 01:26:19.060
form a government he couldn't do it like

01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:21.700

01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:24.940
don't know I mean maybe so maybe this

01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:26.170
other guy can't pull it out and then

01:26:26.170 --> 01:26:29.590
Trudeau push Trudeau on Trudeau he

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:33.430
somehow overcame the most ridiculous

01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:37.600
political scandal was this wait

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.570

yo Michelle has a fat ass did you ever

01:27:39.010 --> 01:27:41.680

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:45.880
bathtub like cereal what you never seen

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.830
know while you're pulling that up I did

01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:49.420
know one thing I wanted to say about it

01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:52.990
is another financial mystery in Israel

01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:56.470
that I is Netanyahu's family's ice cream

01:27:56.470 --> 01:28:01.150
budget what they get so like a ton a ton

01:28:01.150 --> 01:28:04.360
of pistachio ice cream it's the most

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:09.700
Jewish ice cream and it's like that's

01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:12.820
that's part of like the budget when he

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:16.360
was like I'm I okay maybe not anymore

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.190
maybe he was like scrutinized for it but

01:28:18.190 --> 01:28:22.780
I know pistachio ice cream is flowing in

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:28.150
his residence so he was definitely he

01:28:28.150 --> 01:28:29.500
was chomping on a

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:32.800
which is I mean it's not like it's I

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.750
think it's that it was more of like a

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:36.430
hit piece probably that I read or

01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:37.900
something that was just to throw him in

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.280

change my opinion oh yeah honestly he's

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:52.240
probably in a better mood from what I

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.720
know about having ice cream I usually

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.100

didn't know I do that all the time yeah

01:42:06.890 --> 01:42:08.540
I've seen that before so Wes Watson was

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:09.830
a guy who was in the California prison

01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:15.560
system as a white due to the California

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.540
prison system you have to join the Aryan

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:19.520

I don't know what Jewish Jews do in jail

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.000
you'd have to just give advice well

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.980

although the West blossom vague it's

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:21.980
just the reality of the California

prison system he's not racist but the

01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:28.550

a couple weeks ago so that was too much

01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:25.780
for me that was kind of disconcerting

01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:29.580
when I heard you blacked out I know yeah

01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:32.110
it's what it's funny because it's like I

01:58:32.110 --> 01:58:33.160
was thinking about that because it's

01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:35.530
like when you're younger and you do it

01:58:35.530 --> 01:58:37.870
you and you're doing or not even like

01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:38.860
blacking out but you're just getting

01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:42.520
drunk a lot yeah if you did that which I

01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:48.370
did it was like oh this is uh I don't

01:58:48.370 --> 01:58:50.080
know it just like fell sick rite of

01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:50.710
passage

01:58:50.710 --> 01:58:53.500
yes and it's in like a small window yeah

01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:56.890
now like I mean I I've been alive for

01:58:56.890 --> 01:58:59.340
long it looked at my life is longer and

01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:02.080
then there's like a couple spots where I

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:06.520
blacked out and it feels worse a lot

01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:09.370
worse what's I don't know in like in the

01:59:09.370 --> 01:59:10.870
short window of stuff it's like oh this

01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:13.870
is just a crazy time I'm just yeah I'm

01:59:13.870 --> 01:59:15.190
taking everything in

01:59:15.190 --> 01:59:17.970
I'm drink a lot but then now it's like

01:59:17.970 --> 01:59:20.710
there's there's a whole normal pretty

01:59:20.710 --> 01:59:21.849
boring

01:59:21.849 --> 01:59:25.719
around around cool yeah it's like I was

01:59:25.719 --> 01:59:28.349
like all dude you were so drunk yeah

01:59:28.349 --> 01:59:32.559
yeah yeah just the yeah I'm in you know

01:59:32.559 --> 01:59:34.869
a man that is blacked out six

01:59:34.869 --> 01:59:36.369
rite-of-passage now that it's like you

01:59:36.369 --> 01:59:39.369
go to college you get like just ruin

01:59:39.369 --> 01:59:41.409
your body with alcohol yeah and you just

01:59:41.409 --> 01:59:43.689
prepare yourself for typically like a

01:59:43.689 --> 01:59:46.539
very dull existence so you see like a

01:59:46.539 --> 01:59:48.340
blitter rated on alcohol and then you

01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:49.840
just kind of like kind of wither away

01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:52.570
like a job you hate yeah which is yeah

01:59:52.570 --> 01:59:56.169
pretty tight pretty cool instead of like

01:59:56.169 --> 01:59:57.999
tripping on ayahuasca and like hunting

01:59:57.999 --> 02:00:01.239

get shitty and then yeah I like get

02:00:03.729 --> 02:00:05.379
prepared for happy hours and then yeah

02:00:05.379 --> 02:00:07.449
then you're like kind of on yeah yeah

02:00:07.449 --> 02:00:13.989
yeah kind of know about that yeah I

02:00:13.989 --> 02:00:17.769
don't know I mean it seems like probably

02:00:17.769 --> 02:00:21.820
a existence where you're mostly living

02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:25.269
in like memory like glory college days

02:00:25.269 --> 02:00:27.340

alienated I was like man that was great

02:00:44.889 --> 02:00:47.070
I've just been on a slow blur of like

02:00:47.070 --> 02:00:49.719
just being fragmented and alienated

02:00:49.719 --> 02:00:52.679
within my own life Here I am

02:00:52.679 --> 02:00:59.280
