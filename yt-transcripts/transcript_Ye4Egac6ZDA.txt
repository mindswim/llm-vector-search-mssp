for a little bit and i was just like i

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.000

this what'd you train jiu jitsu and uh

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.720

had to do was just one dunk did she

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.360
touch the backboard straight tense the

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.880
other guy zion williamson we just

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.880
sexism dude it was pure sexism

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.560
i would've been a judge who was just

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.160
like four

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.639
if i went out there and did despite my

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.720
being 5 11 and did a one-handed dunk i'd

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.039
gotten like a two yeah like yeah get

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:34.240
this guy the [ __ ] out of here he's

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.120
straight

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.120
but then the crowd knew like she dunked

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.800
in the first round got a hundred got a

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.560
perfect score and should i do the same

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.240
and then the next round she was like i'm

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.479
gonna go for a two-handed dunk couldn't

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:45.440
land it

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.720
couldn't stick it she was great would

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.840
you get a nine

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.199
yeah pretty much she advanced to the

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:52.080
finals not making a dunk what and then

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.639
the best was the final round

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:57.039
in the finals she made the finals and

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:58.879
she did like this like

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:01.280
still on the ground like windmill

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.720
like while she was running she picked

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.160
the ball up and did a windmill and then

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.240
did a one-handed dunk

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.520
that's pretty great the crowd was just

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.120
like nah she didn't get they didn't give

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.120

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.040
in

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.800
junior year i did a chemistry project

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.640
that was a purely fake project me and my

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.920
friend just got drunk my parents went to

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.680

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.000
put like i remember we

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.519
we just put pictures of like weird [ __ ]

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:07.040
on this board and just lifted it up and

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.399
like put it on the table and this lady

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:10.000
was just like d it's like that's not

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.440
what was your project

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.040
it was supposed to be like like a famous

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.880
chemist and like you know what they did

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.079
and how they changed the world and we

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:17.680
were drinking wine so we like just put

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.040
pictures of king henry everywhere

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.160
because we're calling it king henry the

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.560
eighth we're drinking we're like hammers

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.920

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.800
jesus christ dude

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.230

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.399
[Laughter]

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:34.320
oh man that's that sucks you didn't

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.160
place at the science fair no i thought i

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.560
thought college football

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.760
home field advantage would have been a

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.519
big a big scientific

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:44.480
you should have just done like an

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.399
african accent and would have been like

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:49.279
it's just really bad

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.279
yeah yeah i was pretty much the will

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:55.040
smith of college football home field

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.720
advantage

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.839
i broke it in and then the college

00:11:57.839 --> 00:11:59.920
football ncaa shut it down dude yes

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.160
double a started giving me death threats

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.079
don't let the people know about this

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:05.360
that's why there's so many neutral side

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.279
games now they found my they found my

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:08.240
studies

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.920
they found your [ __ ] like light board

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.079
your trifold they're like holy [ __ ] this

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:14.079
guy's onto it i remember the picture too

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:15.680
because it was notre dame stadium and i

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.279
just ripped it out of a calendar i had

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:19.760
so it had like the shitty the top of it

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.480
was all ripped

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:24.240
i don't think my parents ever helped me

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.000
with like projects like that so like

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.600
kids would come in with like roller

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.360
coasters made out of [ __ ] toothpicks

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.040
yeah and i'm in there trying to present

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.320
a picture of notre dame i mean that's

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.839
kind of that's kind of sick for parents

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:35.360
to do that honestly i mean it's one

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.200
thing if you're just like

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.560
if you're just being lazy and you don't

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.680
feel like dealing with your dumb kid

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.120
you're like [ __ ] it i'm gonna do it or

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.720
you know it's probably kind of fun then

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.240
you know once you're 40 it's like hell

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.600
yeah dude i'll build a phone oh yeah we

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.040
got [ __ ] up stop thinking about

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.160
jumping out the window every five

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.959
seconds well it's funny where it

00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:52.480
transitions nicely because i was looking

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.519
at all those

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:55.200
uh march for life

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.040

because i was watching i spent i spent a

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.519
lot of time watching uh

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:17.839
denny's fights mm-hmm which is just

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:19.519
black people destroying denny's yeah

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:21.199
fights

00:15:21.199 --> 00:15:22.880
like [ __ ] white managers getting

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.320
their asses kicked

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.880

i've seen some pretty good uh some ihop

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.120
battles i think my favorite one is a

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.839
denny's fight it's halloween in oakland

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:40.720
yeah so it's it's like two squads of

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.920
black chicks

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.120
fighting each other and they're all in

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.240
costumes yeah they're just like

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.160
bumblebees

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.440
and one squad is out in the dining area

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.720
and the other squad's basically in the

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.320
kitchen at this point they've been they

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.480
retreated to the kitchen but they're all

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.920
just finding [ __ ] to throw at each other

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.320
it's they just [ __ ] destroy this yeah

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.759
being in costumes is pretty nice for

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:00.560
that

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.720
they're all fat black ladies dressed up

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.720
and like princesses

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.720
throwing plates at each other it's so

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.600
good

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.440
that's pretty [ __ ] funny uh so i

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.120

gumption what is it i said if we're on a

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.720
kick of individuals being responsible

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.040
for their entire race's actions i think

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.600
black people owe at denny's a sincere

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.519
apology

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:33.920
no wonder nobody ever liked it

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.839
you got 10 likes they had 10 likes

00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:37.120
anybody that's seen a denny's fight

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.440

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.880
what's the black community's greatest

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.440
disgrace

00:16:45.199 --> 00:16:46.880
yeah that's a that's a tough one to get

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.560
behind on because it's not really

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.079

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:07.439
apple on a white screen and it's like

00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:08.640
some people will tell you this is a

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.120
banana they might scream this is a

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.559
banana they may say banana banana banana

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:17.360
but this is an apple and it's like facts

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.919
rule cnn but it's like what is this

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:22.079
transphobic

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.160
i mean it was supposed to be anti-trump

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.160
yeah like obviously they might in all

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.120
caps say this is a banana yeah but it's

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.960
like you could also make this the exact

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.760
same commercial just transphobic

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.919
yeah you could like you may scream this

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:38.799
is a banana it's a [ __ ] apple yeah

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:40.160
exactly you mean yeah you do have

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.600
anything men and women and stuff that's

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.440
a good point i mean that's sick though

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.440
just to watch that be like [ __ ] yeah i

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.600
possess the truth cnn possesses the

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.080
truth and i'm directly tapped into it

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.919
perfect if it just said

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:53.440
the exact same commercial except at the

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.000
end of cnn it was just the fox news logo

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.039
they'd be like this is transphobic

00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:00.799
the exact same messages yeah i see i

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:02.080
could see that oh yeah i guess they

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.520
could put some phallic [ __ ] on the

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.880
banana and i guess

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.559
just like that's not what that is we're

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:08.720
lying to ourselves fox would be like

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.360
this not a girl this is a boy yeah [ __ ]

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.320
he wouldn't they wouldn't get that

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.720
cryptic

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.320
i was thinking today

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.600
i think it was like this morning i was

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.520
just chilling i don't know i don't even

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.640
know what brought this up but i was

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.240
thinking about like how

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.520
when you're little

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.840
you're basically

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.240
like we we have like a little like uh

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.679
we're like savages when we're little

00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:32.799
it's like you're like we have this

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:34.240
little bubble of like magical thinking

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.000
where it's like santa claus easter bunny

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.679
yeah tooth fairy so you kind of grow up

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:40.000
like a weird like indigenous person from

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.400
like the 1500s do we believe in all this

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.919
[ __ ] up [ __ ] and slowly your parents

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:45.200
are like all right dude we're gonna

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.039
repeal those things for me yeah then one

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:48.240
day someone's like yeah you know god's

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.600
probably not real either and you're like

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.080
what the [ __ ] going on now nothing's

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.000
real and you watch cnn you're like oh

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.200
sick the truth

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.960
there you go perfect that's how the

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.799
marxist sketch yeah

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:00.559
that is weird to think about how you

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:02.080
just grow up it's like an absolute

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.600
fantasy world that gets destroyed and

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.679
you're just like [ __ ] what do i do now

00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:07.360
they're like here sit at a desk it's

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.080
like that bill burbit what the one where

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.080
he's talking about when he loses he's

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.520
like when you wake up and you're young

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.120
it's the exact same thing same thing

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.960
like she's like santa claus isn't real

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.559
[ __ ] easter bunny and he's like and

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:21.520
then you lose god god's not real

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.280
yeah then you figure out you just you're

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.120
an animal you just organically came up

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.880
with a bill burbit just like that dude

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.559
this is i mean not a parallel thinking i

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:30.240

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.840
here today but you're just here ditching

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.960
out the truth

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.880
same thing about foreskin

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.400
everybody knows i can't wait till we get

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.679
our guest you try to hit me with that

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.120
vignette of one person dude you're like

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.880
oh one guy said that he got his cut off

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.400
and he's fine oh yeah well that's and

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.880
then mckeever right away said nah dude

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.760
hurt my dick a listener yeah came up to

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.280
me and said

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.240
i got circumcised when i was like 23.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.120
and he was like and there's no

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.799
difference he probably doesn't use a

00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:57.840
dick

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.900
i think he's got a kid

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.520
[Laughter]

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.720
he probably uses his name he's got one

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.720
good cream

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.880
but i don't take those anecdotal levels

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.320
i'm a scientist i just think it's funny

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.440
somebody got searched when they were

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.360
like 24. that sucks man i try to think

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.960
about that it's like my dick hurt for a

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.799
month it was like swollen and [ __ ] up

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:16.720
really yeah and he's still like yeah

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.679
it's chill

00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:19.520
i guess it was a medical necessity or

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.720
was he like

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.480
was it it was his wife then purely

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.480
aesthetic it was his girl then

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.799
his girl made him do that think about

00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:28.480
that you never know

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.919
i don't want to just assume that's okay

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:32.000
i'm not cnn no dude it's like let me

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
take a knife to my dick out of nowhere

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.280
that guy was

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.200
why dude because he's a lunatic what

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.280
happened i don't know someone stopped a

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.799
hand job and was like i can't do this

00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:42.159
and he was like [ __ ] it i'm getting it

00:20:42.159 --> 00:20:44.080
cut maybe

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.600
that would probably cause that would

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.120
bring you too under no circumstances

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.480
would ever cut if someone was like yo

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.679
and put a knife to your bird i'd be like

00:20:49.679 --> 00:20:51.679
my answer eternally is no until

00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:52.960
something [ __ ] up that happens to me

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.559
and i'm like so you're getting a [ __ ]

00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:56.480
skin hand job and the lady's like you

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.159
got a gross dick

00:20:58.159 --> 00:20:59.280
imagine how many times you got to be

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.159
told your dick's gross to cut

00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:03.840
i'm going under surgery i mean it might

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.919
you could just be one girl you know so

00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:07.280
if the right one tells you it's gross

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.440
it's gross sure right one tells you it's

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.200
small it's [ __ ] small think of it

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.559
right one tells you it's big still

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:14.880

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.400

the kid on you and so i can serve you

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.200
the thing that terrifies me is that they

that can go wrong

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:40.480
getting certain and it happens it goes

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.919
wrong every now and again a dude a kid

00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:43.679
just [ __ ] god bless him loses his

00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:45.600

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.880

did i tell you what happened one time

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.360
what they had a um so that there was an

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.320
infant because there's a lot of people

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.799
who think like there's no biological

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:58.480
if you're like as a kid you're a blank

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.000
slate and like society makes you a man

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.799
or a woman in your mind so a kid lost

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:04.720
his bird due to circumcision had they

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.640
cut it off this doctor who was like

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.919
trying to push his point of being like

00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:10.000
yeah dude we're totally blank slates got

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.600
his hands on that kid

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.679
and uh completely was like gave him

00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:15.679
therapy from the time he was a baby

00:22:15.679 --> 00:22:16.960
into like turned him into a girl

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.159
basically was showing him like dudes

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:19.280
like this is what you're into this is

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.240
hot

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.200
it's pretty hot so like this

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.520
boy i guess it was a girl then because i

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.880
got his dick chopped off and the doctor

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.320
tricked it but

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.840
it was like it just started freaking the

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.679
[ __ ] out at like 12 years old just went

00:22:31.679 --> 00:22:32.559
nuts

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.240
and then eventually found the parents

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.440
were like all right we're gonna stop

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.880
lying to you when you're 16. like you

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.240
were born with a dong and then we had to

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.000
cut it off because of circumcision i

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.760

00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:34.800
second amendment thing is like uh

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.240
when when people are like oh you think

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.320
your ar-15 is going to stop a [ __ ]

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.160
drone like if the if the government

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.680
decide to attack

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.440
civilians yeah

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.720
and they're always like yeah let's see

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.560
how your [ __ ]

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.240
assault rifle does against the [ __ ]

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.000
abrams tank

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.839
and it's like

00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:54.480
isn't that exactly what insurgents in

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.920
iraq have

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.760
it's like assault rifles it's like the

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.359
reason yeah our assault rifle would be

00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:01.520
successful against a drone is because

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.040
hopefully the government's so concerned

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.920
about civilian casualties yeah and it's

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.000
like i mean okay dude my thing is that's

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.359
the worst argument in the world because

00:38:09.359 --> 00:38:10.480
like yeah you're right i should buy some

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.000
stinger missiles too i never thought

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.960
about it

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.560
true i gotta get my hand on some mortars

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.839
yeah let me get some stinger missiles

00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:17.760
and some tripwire dude some claymores

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.200
that's the dumbest [ __ ] argument but

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.760
yeah it's it's if if the government was

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.160
fighting civilians yeah

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.839
they wouldn't be trying to eradicate

00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:27.359
every civilian so it wouldn't be like oh

00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:29.520
we're gonna [ __ ] bomb this city dude

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.960
nor do they they

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.720
the amount of civilians to government is

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.720
like ants to humans

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.320
if all if they were like go to war with

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.839
civilians they would get [ __ ] they

00:38:37.839 --> 00:38:39.119
are sufficient because there's

00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:41.280
that's well yeah they are all true

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.960
civilians but like the people who work

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.480
in the government and the military

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.440
combined combined with the population if

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.240
like

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.240
even 60 percent of them strapped up a

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.320
rifle a couple of female dunkers hopped

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.000
in there grabbed an ar-15

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.320
dude it's we the people of america

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.000
outweigh outnumber the government in

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.480
like an unbelievable way i wonder what

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.400
it is because how many people are in the

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.520
military act like

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.040
what is it i mean

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.760
not as many as do we have like a million

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.960
i don't even personnel i don't think we

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.960
have a million but i bet if you can

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.160
i don't know are we talking state

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.920
workers we talking government workers

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.359
talking about like capitol hill talking

00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:18.720
about black ladies in harrisburg

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.240
pennsylvania

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.240
i think i think it's capitol hill so

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.480
some so some no doubt but i'm saying

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.359
like

00:39:25.359 --> 00:39:26.960
top advisors congress i'm thinking

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.880
congressman senate

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.000
president

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.440
cab

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.560
[ __ ] yeah this is a good conversation

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.560
people are probably tuning out right now

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.599
[ __ ] them

00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:39.200
yeah but that's that's always i was

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.040
trying to defend my [ __ ] right that's

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.800
a [ __ ] [ __ ] argument it is stupid

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.720
it's like well yeah i mean obviously if

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.320
the government is trying to kill

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.640
everyone then having an assault rifle is

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.760
useless if you're fighting the

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.480
government yeah chances are the tax base

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.839
it's like it's like attacking your own

00:39:53.839 --> 00:39:55.280
bank account

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.200
it would be like an isis situation where

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.520
patriots like you and me

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.960
how do you say it again

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.280
you and me patriots we're getting tread

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.079
on

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:05.599
and we're like yo we're [ __ ] tired of

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:06.880
getting tread on and then we have to

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.880
throw gay guys off roofs

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.839
wow

00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:17.040
classic isis i've been reading a book

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.880
about uh

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.200
like the drug war and like how drug

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.320
addicts how we have it completely are

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.440
you reading it

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.599
yeah audiobook through my ears all right

00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:27.760
and the uh clarify audiobook through my

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.160
ears reading it and dude this guy his

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.520
whole thing is that like we're doing the

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.440
whole thing completely wrong

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.560
so they're saying the whole thing the

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.240
idea like the whole government goes off

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.400
of is you know pretty much everyone is

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.760
that there's a chemical you do the

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.599
chemical hooks into your brain you're

00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:43.680
addicted you're a slave to the chemical

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.280
and uh

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.640
apparently like none of them have

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.599
anything to do with like your

00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:49.440
environment at all so they're doing like

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.400
they would do

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.079
experiments where they put us a mouse

00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:54.480
they'd isolate a rat in a cage and put

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.640
like a cocaine infused water

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.640
and they would just watch the rats water

00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.839
yeah they'd watch the rat become

00:40:59.839 --> 00:41:01.599
addicted to the [ __ ] the to the

00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:03.359
picture they'll just drink it and drink

00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:04.480
it and drink it and [ __ ] die and

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.920
everyone's like see you do cocaine

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.359
that's what happened to you then some

00:41:07.359 --> 00:41:10.160
other guy built like a big rat utopia

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.760
with like all these other rats all these

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.400
toys and [ __ ] over at utopia

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.599
it's like rat heaven dude it has all

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:17.599
these like food it has all kinds of cool

00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:19.920
[ __ ] and then they put morphine so they

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.200
have a regular water thing and a

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.960
morphine water and then they noticed

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.640
that like

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.319
i think it was like 12 percent of the

00:41:26.319 --> 00:41:28.560
rats became addicted to the morphine

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.160
that's a chill and they they try to get

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.440
money they try to get money like we're

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.640
going to extend they're going to expand

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.079
on this experiment

00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:35.280
they were like

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.280
nah bro that's that's an abomination to

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:40.000
science get rid of that thing

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.440
so the guy's whole point is that like

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.960
it's all all [ __ ] up the way we're

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.839
going about this whole thing

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.440
i don't

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.200
you didn't explain

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.920
so basically by by taking like

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.520
so if you have like drug addicts and

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.880
you're just like all right locking your

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.640
ass up throwing you in jail [ __ ] you

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.319
you're a piece of [ __ ] that's that's

00:41:58.319 --> 00:41:59.359
what they're saying it's like it's

00:41:59.359 --> 00:42:01.520
environmental and same with nicotine

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.400
patches

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.920
when they release nicotine patches they

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.040
were like all right

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.960
if if that's the case if it's just like

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.640
you're addicted to a chemical

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.960
you should have a 100 success rate yeah

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.800
it was like 17 percent of people who put

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.960
on nicotine patch stop smoking yeah so

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.319
it's like that makes sense it's more

00:42:16.319 --> 00:42:18.160
about the it's more about the ritual

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.599
exactly there was other there was other

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:21.280
instances where they'd have

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.520
uh like the east side of vancouver where

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.359
they'd have they'd have drug addicts

00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:27.760
like they're all heroin addicts and

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.359
this one i was kind of like if it

00:42:29.359 --> 00:42:30.560
hesitant on but they were saying they

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.480
completely embargoed heroin that like

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.400
the ports were shut down so they're like

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.079
there's no [ __ ] way they got heroin

00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:37.520
into the city and people were just

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.640
carrying on about their day like

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.160
shooting [ __ ] heroin and stuff and it

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.000
was just fake heroin and everyone was

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.760
carried on people weren't in like

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.880
throwing up in the streets or like

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.560
laying there having withdrawals well

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.000
that doesn't make sense

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.440
you're saying withdrawals are like a

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.359
social construct no they say they they

00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:52.640
say you can have them but they're not as

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.720
bad as people make it out to be they

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.040
said it's like a light flu that like you

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.480
don't die from withdrawals unless you're

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.280
already compromised like an aids patient

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.880
from heroin you can die from alcohol

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.440
withdrawals

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.839
from heroin withdrawals are not bad it's

00:43:07.839 --> 00:43:09.359
all mental they're saying it's not as

00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:10.960
bad as people make it no they're saying

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.720
it's more anguished mentally from all

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.400
like your emotions coming back physical

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.680
symptoms are like

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.280
they're not as big as the deal

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.560
interesting it's weird too that people

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.480
like to see that fact checked yeah well

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.240
they're saying people just kept on going

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.079
on shooting up [ __ ] fake heroine but

00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:25.520
my thing here was my thing with it it

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.560
was like

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.560
you might think you embargoed the city

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.680
because the police are like yeah we

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.119
embargoed the city it's like people were

00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:32.560
driving and [ __ ] heroin yeah why

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.680
didn't you why didn't you embargo the

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.440
city earlier i think it was cause like

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.040
the ports had a strike so it was like

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.560
out of their control okay

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.920
or they'd like it it was like a big

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.440
seizure i guess east of vancouver are

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.880
small but my thing is like dude they can

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.880
still drive so like even though the cops

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.000
are like we cut off all the way we went

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.560
to west vancouver exactly yeah i went to

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.480
a canucks game dude yeah yeah got some

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.920
[ __ ] hair but it's still interesting

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.160
to think about luango net mining dude

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.520
their their thing is that they're

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.680
addicted more to the subculture of

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.680
heroin addicts because it's like

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.280
they're actually

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.040
able to be someone it's like because the

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.720
guy was like if i quit i was a janitor

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.200
he's like or i can like run around in

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.839
this crazy rampage game with like cops

00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:11.599
getting high yeah the possibility of

00:44:11.599 --> 00:44:13.280
dying hanging out with hookers and [ __ ]

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.319
he's like

00:44:14.319 --> 00:44:17.200
why would i quit it's so [ __ ] fun

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.720
it's like the only thing i can do the

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.839
only thing that's left for me is a

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:22.640
boring shitty [ __ ] job yeah he's like

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.920
i might as well go down as well live on

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.200
the edge yeah and the guy's whole

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.960
arguments the drug war creates that

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.200
weird crazy wild game if that was gone

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.720
they're like wouldn't be like that

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.480
interesting it's a good book man it's

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.160
really good it's really cool

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.800
uh chasing the screams chasing the

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.560
screens yeah chasing a scream or

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.640
something wow i think so

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.920
following the scream i don't know

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.359
something it's good it sounds like

00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:45.680
everybody's pretty consistently against

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.920
the drug war yeah but that's that's the

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.160
whole thing they are but it you know

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.000
still wages on pretty [ __ ] hard yeah

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.280
donald trump didn't he just say he

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.040
wanted to like execute drugs he wants to

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.960
murder well that's what the headlines

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.480
are saying but they say chasing the

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.240
screen that's what it's called

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.920
that if you sell an opiate to someone in

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.200
the overdose he wants to give you the

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.560
death penalty

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.839
which is kind of [ __ ] because it's

00:45:05.839 --> 00:45:07.920
like if you sell someone manslaughter

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.760
heroin my thing is what if you sell

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:10.960
someone heroin that you think they're

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.400
gonna sell and they just pig the [ __ ]

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.079
out and shoot up a ton of it they could

00:45:14.079 --> 00:45:15.760
have just commit suicide via you know

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.640
what i mean

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.560
but the fentanyl [ __ ] is like you could

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.440
[ __ ] croak right then and there yeah

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.599
scary you know what i just noticed well

00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:25.520
you see that

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.599
do you notice anything about that my uh

00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:30.240
my nightstand

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.119
is it broken no do you see that sock

00:45:33.119 --> 00:45:34.480
oh what'd you do with that sock that was

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.200
a prepared jerk off you left that out i

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.720
left that out because i was gonna jerk

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:39.520
off

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.040
right before i got in bed that's ritual

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.880
that's ritualistic that's a nice move

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.119
damn dude that's like a shitty sock

00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:46.800
sitting there and i was like [ __ ] it i

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.160
don't have any tissues down here i'm

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.920
gonna nut into that sock if i need to

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.680
damn dude you know what i did last night

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.480
you got the other one you got his

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.800
brother right there that one survived

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.680
what'd you do didn't jerk off

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.280
still sitting there

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.680
you know sometimes you just you fought

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.280
your demons dude fought off mine

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.960
horrible jerk off demons that's pretty

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.200
funny man because i uh i was when i was

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.240
listening to this book they were talking

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.319
about the difference between

00:46:10.319 --> 00:46:12.160
chemical addiction or was it called

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.000
chemical dependency and addiction and

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.359
they're saying dependencies like you

00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:16.480
know if you stop drinking coffee you get

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.480
a headache but addiction is like if i

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.839
don't drink coffee i won't be able to

00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:21.839
focus and do this and i was laughing

00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:23.599
like i guess that makes sense and it

00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:24.880
instantly flashed at me being like i

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:25.920
have to jerk off and watch porn

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.240
otherwise i can't fall asleep like damn

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.319
damn that's [ __ ] spot on

00:46:30.319 --> 00:46:31.440
there's a difference between chemical

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.560
dependency and addiction that's what

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.480
they're trying to say like like the

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.480
i think robert dupont is the guy who's

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.000
like at least the time of the book he's

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.760
like in charge of like uh

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.839
like the scientific like studying drugs

00:46:41.839 --> 00:46:43.040
and all that stuff and they're saying

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.920
like they're leaving out like 80 of what

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.680
comes down to it's pretty cool yeah but

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.640
isn't

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.319
is it like a chemical

00:46:50.319 --> 00:46:51.359
addiction

00:46:51.359 --> 00:46:53.520
responsible for your thoughts to be like

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.960
i need this

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.319
well you're saying like your brain

00:46:56.319 --> 00:46:58.560
releasing dopamine and that

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.400
sure like neurotransmitters i mean no

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.920
matter what it's a chemical reaction

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.359
that's what they that's what they do for

00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:04.640
the research now they just base it down

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.160
to the pure chemical reaction but it's

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.920
like but then if you look at people who

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.839
are hooked on drugs and overwhelming

00:47:09.839 --> 00:47:11.119
majority of them had like early

00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:13.200
childhood trauma to where it's like

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.119
all right but like i'm i think i'm

00:47:15.119 --> 00:47:16.640
addicted to dip

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.920
yeah which is interesting because you

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.520
tried the gum so if that's the case you

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.760
know i did have the gum and it worked

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.440
and then i was driving home from boston

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.720
and i was like falling asleep and i was

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.800
like i'll have one [ __ ] it yeah like i

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.880
didn't quit for good but i i was

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.640
i mean i didn't dip for like six months

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.880
so the chemicals would have been gone

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.480
exactly but

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.079
there's still the chemicals were

00:47:36.079 --> 00:47:38.160
responsible for me enjoying it which

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.560
results in me being like

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.319
yeah i'll have another one or that but

00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:44.000
no that that's the thing but it left

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.319
your system so it was gone and then it

00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:48.000
was kind of possible originally for the

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.319
good feeling i had when i did it okay

00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:52.640
the nicotine yeah so now i'm like

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.160
i want that feeling again but do you get

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.319
the same feeling every time you do it no

00:47:56.319 --> 00:47:59.040
exactly so now it's like this is i

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.359
i win yes yes you did

00:48:01.359 --> 00:48:03.119
you definitely went heroin overdoses

00:48:03.119 --> 00:48:05.520
just like a light clue oh gotcha no i

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.839
said overdose draw is like a light flu

00:48:07.839 --> 00:48:09.280
that's what they're saying

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.560
because they were saying people came

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.480
back from vietnam and it was like one

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.680
out of five

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.599
soldiers was doing heroin then and when

00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:17.200
they came back and quit heroin because

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.640
they came to a normal environment they

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.240
were just like most people just quit

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.000
pretty easily

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.960
okay

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.960
check it out dude yeah getting the right

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.480
getting getting a rat utopian i need to

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.839
listen to that one book getting a rat

00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:29.760
utopia i mean dude it's [ __ ] pretty

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.440
good he backs i don't believe it i'm

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.040
just saying i think you read these books

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.200
or listen to these books and then you

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.119
think they're fact no i i just think

00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:38.559
it's interesting to think about i don't

00:48:38.559 --> 00:48:40.480
i never like i'm like descartes dude i

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.520
don't know what's real it's like our

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.280
[ __ ] being a plunger for other men's

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.119
semen dude that makes sense no it

00:48:45.119 --> 00:48:46.480
doesn't that makes sense that makes no

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.400
sense you got a fat mushroom dip that

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.240
makes no sense do you got a fat mushroom

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:54.160
tips what i ask you bro i i don't know

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.319
but that doesn't make any sense

00:48:56.319 --> 00:48:58.559
yeah it does you know you didn't live in

00:48:58.559 --> 00:49:00.880
the day your dick is there to plunge out

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.800
your [ __ ] is shaped the way it is to

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.200
plunge out other guys [ __ ] yeah dude

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.880
there was millions of years

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.839
stays in a girl's vagina like 24 hours

00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:11.440
you got to realize we were alive for

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.520
millions of years to where like there

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.040
wasn't any me too people were running

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.040
around you saw a girl you [ __ ] jumped

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.160
on her and [ __ ] her and then like you

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.520
would be like oh and you would be like

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.680
the third one that day

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.440
i'm talking about like we where we

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.599
evolved from millions of years ago

00:49:25.599 --> 00:49:26.960
so

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.559
all right there's a ton of stuff you're

00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:31.200
thinking of like the 1970s no i'm not

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.119
dude you still you said this

00:49:33.119 --> 00:49:34.880
i'm thinking of a scientist right now

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.480
yeah probably not a scientist but

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.720
diagnosing why the shape of our penis is

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.960
the way it is evolutionary science yeah

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.960
a guy saying that's why it is

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.880
yeah it's evolutionary sciences why are

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.319
things how could you possibly determine

00:49:46.319 --> 00:49:48.079
that

00:49:48.079 --> 00:49:49.760
it's just theory it's scientific theory

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.920
that i describe to theory yeah exactly

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.599
everything is dude you'll come down this

00:49:53.599 --> 00:49:55.599
rabbit hole with me no it just makes

00:49:55.599 --> 00:49:56.640
sense

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.400
and you

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.720
it turns you on too knowing a girl just

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.720
got just had sex i already talked about

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.720
this this is where kuggle stuff is sure

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.160
but i'm saying firm competition i'm

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.520
saying

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.160
one of your theories that you heard is

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.800
the shape of our [ __ ] is designed

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.440
specifically to plunge come out of women

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.640
yes dude okay that makes perfect sense

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.800
it's literally a plunger wouldn't comes

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.119
literally a liquid when that plunger own

00:50:23.119 --> 00:50:25.119
come then if you keep thrusting

00:50:25.119 --> 00:50:26.480
you [ __ ]

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.839
and then you're out and then you guard

00:50:27.839 --> 00:50:28.960
her the rest of the night and make sure

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.040
no one else kind of [ __ ] plunge

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.040
yourself because you're so you're your

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.520
tip your hole is beneath you

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.440
but then you keep coming in and passing

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.079
it when i come i'm in i lock up i dog

00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:42.000
i'm like a dog i lock in and i come and

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.200
i don't move and then i just pull out

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.160
you're done

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.559
so your comes behind your dick yeah but

00:50:46.559 --> 00:50:48.480
if you kept thrusting while you're

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.319
coming wouldn't some come get behind

00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:52.240
wouldn't you plunge that out they could

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.839
it very well could yeah but you're still

00:50:53.839 --> 00:50:55.599
the last dude you've been plunging

00:50:55.599 --> 00:50:58.559
effectively for let's say two minutes

00:50:58.559 --> 00:51:00.079
the other dude's coming and then it's

00:51:00.079 --> 00:51:01.520
your turn you just go

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.960
and then you pop out do you see the

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.480
other [ __ ] come out after you plunge it i

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.000
can't speak to my ancestors in this in

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.839
the [ __ ] savannah dude i don't know

00:51:07.839 --> 00:51:10.559
huh you have a gang bang you'll know

00:51:10.559 --> 00:51:12.160
i wonder you could probably consult some

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.839
people that have had gang bangs i will

00:51:13.839 --> 00:51:16.079
and be like guaranteed other people's

00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:18.240
come out do i mean we have to 24 hours

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.359
later

00:51:19.359 --> 00:51:21.440
no i'm talking about the same day dude

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.760
so like literally right after them maybe

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.359
an hour you know maybe she sat down and

00:51:25.359 --> 00:51:27.920
had lunch

00:51:28.079 --> 00:51:29.680
or maybe she laid on her back so another

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.920
[ __ ] dripped out i don't know

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.839
it could be you'd have to watch it but

00:51:33.839 --> 00:51:35.359
i'll study abukkake and see what's going

00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:38.319
on there yeah it's kind of gross too

00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:39.680
plunging it's a gross way to think about

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.440
your dick no one wants to do it but

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.720
truly that's probably what's holding me

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.319
back from grasping this because i think

00:51:44.319 --> 00:51:45.680
it's icky

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.160
not that i think it's just [ __ ] why

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.760
how is that [ __ ]

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.359
how is that [ __ ] that's it's so

00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:54.240
somebody in 2018 was like you know the

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.520
reason you have a [ __ ] that's shaped

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.599
possible one of the possible reasons is

00:51:57.599 --> 00:51:59.520
the plan that's not how it was presented

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.720
the first time i heard you said what

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.200
about to say that when the female orgasm

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.880
the idea for female orgasm is to

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.800
literally like vacuum come up and

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.480
towards the uterus

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.559
i i don't know [ __ ] about that i don't

00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:12.640
know [ __ ] about female orgasms i'm

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.640
[ __ ] i don't ever do that that's what

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.079
i heard yes

00:52:16.079 --> 00:52:18.880
you heard that yeah that women have had

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.240
they have orgasms

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.520
the plungers no it wasn't a different

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.880
book it was a whole different thing that

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.480
like when women come the point of them

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.720
coming is it acts as like a vacuum and

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.119
sucks the way their muscles [ __ ]

00:52:29.119 --> 00:52:30.079
quiver

00:52:30.079 --> 00:52:31.920
nice theoretically the way they [ __ ]

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.520
shake yeah

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.240
well that i mean that makes some sense i

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.520
don't know why not a plunger then

00:52:39.839 --> 00:52:42.640
that doesn't make much sense to me

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.040
to plunge it out yeah all right that's

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.720
fair

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.319
well you just don't like the idea of

00:52:48.319 --> 00:52:49.920
plunge and calm dude no i just think

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.319
it's a [ __ ] made-up [ __ ] idea

00:52:52.319 --> 00:52:54.960
that to to to be like oh that's true why

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.640
do you think you're shaking dude why do

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.160
you think they're shaped like that

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.240
nothing on our body is a mistake dude

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.480
they all it was all for the advantage

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.240
you know of like what it all serves a

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.839
purpose yeah your eyes you can see your

00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:08.160
fingers touched off your dick

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.680
plungers come it's a two in one it

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.839
shoots gum and plunges it okay it's just

00:53:11.839 --> 00:53:13.839
a swiss army knife so this was in what a

00:53:13.839 --> 00:53:15.440
billion wicked thoughts or whatever all

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.400
right this [ __ ] sex bible you found

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.400
you're a [ __ ] muslim and that's your

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.400
crime dude no it's not an extremist i'm

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.480
saying you listened to this book no no

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.920
then you were like everything in this is

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.359
fine see if you were to be like well

00:53:27.359 --> 00:53:29.040
here's here's another theory about why

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.640
it's not a plunger i'll fully listen to

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.319
it and be like okay

00:53:32.319 --> 00:53:34.160
i never but if you just say no if you

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.680
just say i don't like that i say well

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.760
hey bro i'm sorry no you say this is

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.599
fact i don't say it's fact i said it's

00:53:39.599 --> 00:53:41.280
you evolutionary science you

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.720
revolutionary stuff like do you know why

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.240
our dick's shaped like that yeah because

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.599
it's a plunger

00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:47.680
it plunges out other guys come okay that

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.920
was that was how it was presented fair i

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.920
still think you well you know what i

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.920
heard this and i think it might be true

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.760
fair i approached it wrong i approached

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:59.040
it with [ __ ] i was too excited

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.880
i'm skeptical hey man

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.240
you got it there's only way you do you

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.520
have to experiment and see what's going

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.040
on i'm gonna

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.480
well you gotta plunge yourself you gotta

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.440
plunge instead of uh you're gonna be so

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.200
mad when you see ropes just [ __ ]

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.599
coming out behind you instead of

00:54:15.599 --> 00:54:18.079
come though i'll just use something else

00:54:18.079 --> 00:54:19.839
who are you gonna [ __ ] turkey base my

00:54:19.839 --> 00:54:21.200
girlfriend with like

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.839
tapioca pudding

00:54:34.319 --> 00:54:37.280
physically stay in a vagina like to the

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.800
point where you can plunge it out with a

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:39.839
dick

00:54:39.839 --> 00:54:40.880
i don't know that's what i wanted i

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.520
can't say i i thought

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.160
jizz can stay inside a vagina for like

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.119
what depends what they're doing because

00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:48.880
if you come in like physically

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.720
enough that it's big enough that you can

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.400
you can plunge it out i think it stays

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.800
inside from the time you do it about

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.240
like a 15-minute drive to the mall and

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.359
then if they're walking in the mall it

00:54:57.359 --> 00:54:59.280
comes out that's all i can say dude it

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.280
just falls out it just starts coming out

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.800
oh

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.480
hey man

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.839
why'd you say to the mall

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.839
dude that's [ __ ] up

00:55:11.839 --> 00:55:15.200
that's a [ __ ] terrible statement

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.040
that's all i can say i'd say about a

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.720
15-minute car ride

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.960
as soon as you pass joseph a bank it'll

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.839
start coming out in jose banks

00:55:23.839 --> 00:55:24.960
she's not going to like the way your

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.319
underwear looks i guarantee you

00:55:29.599 --> 00:55:31.680
oh no dude

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.720
[ __ ] you

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.520
[ __ ] that stupid [ __ ] book

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.359
[ __ ] this [ __ ] you can't handle it was

00:55:37.359 --> 00:55:38.960
like when i found out we were animals i

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.240
couldn't handle it dude

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.760
i've known animals since i know i'm

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.680

really wrap my head around that it

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.480
[ __ ] me up dude i would have been

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.280
arguing too but no this isn't some

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:52.400

on this um dude check out evolutionary

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.200
science you probably believe the

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.960
ecosystem is really probably it's not

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.720
june peterson yeah but he still brought

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.000
you down this hole you probably don't

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.760
even like you probably think the

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.920
like the ecosystem is real i feel bad

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.839

dude that was that actually was pretty

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.040
funny i watched a documentary on the

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.720
ecosystem just being a complete

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:37.200
invention which is apparently true same

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.280
with the food pyramid the food pyramid

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:42.000
oh my god [ __ ] [ __ ] the original

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.359
food pyramid yeah you want to get me

00:56:43.359 --> 00:56:44.720
started on this who cares about it why

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.240
the [ __ ] was candy and sweets on top

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.839
dude we don't need that i love sweet

00:56:47.839 --> 00:56:49.520
treats we need that up top but no it's

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.440
really funny though the way so i didn't

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.599
realize this but ecologists

00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:55.040
this these like a few people i think

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.200
they're brothers who founded ecology

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.599
yeah and they're like based off of like

00:56:59.599 --> 00:57:00.880
some

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.720
it's like medieval european religious

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.160
ideas that there's like a balance to

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.079
nature there's like battler systems and

00:57:06.079 --> 00:57:07.359
like if you [ __ ] with them it [ __ ] up

00:57:07.359 --> 00:57:08.640
the balance and all this stuff which i

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:09.760
was always like yeah it makes perfect

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.440
sense but then they went and like

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.040
studied this and it turns it's just pure

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.119
chaos so people are constantly dying and

00:57:15.119 --> 00:57:16.640
trying to get to the top so it's not

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.720
like really things affect one another we

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.119
don't need the bees

00:57:21.119 --> 00:57:22.000
i mean

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.359
yeah but there it's

00:57:23.359 --> 00:57:25.040
who wrote this where did you hear that

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.960
it's ecology if you read ecology now it

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.119
agrees with it like they base there is

00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:30.559
cause and effect but they they had like

00:57:30.559 --> 00:57:32.480
these elaborate systems drawn out they

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.160
were based off of like computer systems

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.760
and they were like it's just the same

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.079
thing so then like the younger ecologist

00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:39.200
came out it was like now it's kind of

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:40.799
just like random chaos and it's not like

00:57:40.799 --> 00:57:42.400
there's not like clear systems that were

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.400
drawn out but then like this guy

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.160
who was like [ __ ] that i'm gonna prove

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.000
myself right went out and he built this

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.319
super computer and he had people go out

00:57:50.319 --> 00:57:51.839
like all of his graduate students walk

00:57:51.839 --> 00:57:54.160
around outside and log every aspect of

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.160
what was going on in nature so be like

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.920
he'd follow like a like a deer and be

00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.760
like the deer just ate three leaves and

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.599
he'd write it down and then

00:58:01.599 --> 00:58:03.680
i swear to god i don't care and they

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.680
didn't do this

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.200
no one cares it's funny

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.960
they input it into a computer so the guy

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.240
would be on the computer being like deer

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.160
just take three leaves yeah and then

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.520
they go back out like oh he took three

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.200
sips of water out of a stream like a bee

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.720
just landed on a flower and they tried

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.640
to like put this whole thing of what was

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.000
going on in the field into a computer

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.359
the computer was just like spat out

00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:23.200
nonsense yeah of course

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.559
it's just so funny they funny there's

00:58:24.559 --> 00:58:26.160
probably millions of dollars some guys

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.440
like i'm gonna track nature and crack

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.640
the code

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.480
oh he was saying there's gonna be like

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.400
there's gonna be an elaborate pattern

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:35.040
coming through isn't that what uh

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:36.960
in a beautiful mind the guy tried to do

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.319
did he he was like trying to come over

00:58:38.319 --> 00:58:40.480
like he was watching like birds

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.440
he was trying to come up with like a

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.040
math equation i didn't see it again i

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.720
was watching like pigeons walk around i

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:45.520
was just more watching his

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.440
hallucinations like wow yeah i don't

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.720
know what the [ __ ] kind of matthew's up

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.720
to anyway you've got some sick theories

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.680
you're working with here dude i'm

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.520
telling you the ecology is that's a sick

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.280
one [ __ ] myth that's a sick one to

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.880
but well they just say now it's like

00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.640
they don't go by like the old like

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.640
there's like systems that balance nature

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.720
it's like see i don't these are all very

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.280
vague terms you'd have to get more into

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.720
you have to wash it down like systems

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.400
that balance nature it's like they had

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.680
like maps where they would draw it out

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.960
like and then this then the soil does

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.240
this to that and then this does like

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.839
feedback loops and they're like none of

00:59:13.839 --> 00:59:15.920
this is [ __ ] true okay so it's just

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.680
funny to think that and then if it's

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.799
funny when people talk about the bounce

00:59:18.799 --> 00:59:20.400
of nature it's sick to be like

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.920
because no one reads about ecology to be

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:23.920
like that's actually not true like what

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.000
[ __ ] you it's like go read an ecology

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.839
does anybody react that way

00:59:27.839 --> 00:59:29.119
i'm ready i'm getting ready for someone

00:59:29.119 --> 00:59:32.559
too you're pretty chilly

00:59:32.559 --> 00:59:35.200
you're telling me nature isn't systems

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.720
no one's gonna you'll guess i'll get

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:38.000
someone with it no one's gonna argue

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.599
with you because no one knows

00:59:39.599 --> 00:59:41.119
exactly there's nothing to you gotta

00:59:41.119 --> 00:59:42.480
watch the doc

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.960
what's the name of doc

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:47.280
uh the loving grace of machines or

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.440
something i forget [ __ ] yeah it's tight

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.760
i heard uh there's a pog doc we need to

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:54.400
watch on netflix the wild wild world

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.680
dude what is that

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.760
that's is that the cult thing yeah i'm

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.880
actually i don't know anything about it

00:59:58.880 --> 00:59:59.920
i'm stoked on that i'm gonna i'm gonna

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.599
watch you watch it next week get ready

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:03.760
for this sick review that'll be tight

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.280
damn what else you got you got any more

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.640
theories here i'm dude i just been

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.680
chilling man

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.839
do with me you know how i do it my audio

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.920
books i really the whole the drug war

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.520
book is [ __ ] cool that's interesting

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.400
to listen to

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.720
there was a lady who uh

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.200
her she was it was in juarez and her

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.040
daughter was like 14 and started like

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.640
dating this guy

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.319
dude eventually like got her pregnant

01:00:24.319 --> 01:00:26.319
and like murdered her with a hammer and

01:00:26.319 --> 01:00:28.160
mom was like super pissed dude the madre

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:28.799
was

01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:29.760
pissed

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.119
out that [ __ ]

01:00:31.119 --> 01:00:32.480
i mean yeah someone could have got

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.000
behind him and done that but the mom was

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.720
like

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.000
you're just bashing my daughter's head

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.440
in and went to him apparently he was a

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.880
zeta no one knew they didn't know this

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.520
so like she like went and approached him

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.880
nothing happened went to the police they

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.079
were like yeah chill the [ __ ] out and

01:00:44.079 --> 01:00:46.079
then she eventually found him in like

01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:47.920
the mexico city or some like state

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.760
capitol or whatever [ __ ] they were went

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.359
to like the capitol steps and like went

01:00:51.359 --> 01:00:52.799
to the governor you have to do something

01:00:52.799 --> 01:00:54.319
and he was just kind of like

01:00:54.319 --> 01:00:56.000
chill lady shut the door like shut her

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.200
out and someone came up and just shot

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.799
her in the back of the head and then

01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:00.559
took her away yeah [ __ ] wild i think

01:01:00.559 --> 01:01:02.240
about yeah

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.760
they've totally lost control like it's

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.359
totally gone they have no control the

01:01:05.359 --> 01:01:07.359
gangs are really scary she went to like

01:01:07.359 --> 01:01:08.720
she like was telling her story like this

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.920
is a guy that murdered my daughter with

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.839
a hammer and the guy literally was like

01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:13.280
uh-huh thank you shut the door and

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.559
someone came out was like pop and

01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:16.079
dragged her off

01:01:16.079 --> 01:01:18.160
dude that [ __ ] is [ __ ] wild yeah i

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.839
was i told you the main board had a

01:01:19.839 --> 01:01:22.720
[ __ ] yeah threat on that for like six

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.880
years of just like

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.160
every once in a while i would get bumped

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.599
back to the front page and you'd see

01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:28.319
like

01:01:28.319 --> 01:01:30.160
just dudes crucified

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.680
on the streets and like these dudes

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.680
[ __ ] like heads off dicks in their

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.720
mouths

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.240
there was one time i think it might have

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.480
been the zetas that they had a truck

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.319
full of dead bodies

01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:41.119
like

01:01:41.119 --> 01:01:42.640
full of dead bodies

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.400
not like a pickup truck like a [ __ ]

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.720
truck an 18-wheeler

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.559
like a u-haul van and they were just

01:01:48.559 --> 01:01:50.480
throwing bodies out onto the highway for

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.640
miles ugh like dude they're [ __ ]

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.839
animals down there they have an

01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:55.359
interview with this one guy who was in

01:01:55.359 --> 01:01:57.359
the zetas build a wall dude they had

01:01:57.359 --> 01:02:00.319
this guy built a wall he was uh he was

01:02:00.319 --> 01:02:02.079
in the zetas and

01:02:02.079 --> 01:02:03.920
he i think they got when he was 14 he

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.680
joined he like went to

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.599
this guy i forget the guy's name was

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:08.799
sevilla or something he went to this

01:02:08.799 --> 01:02:10.000
guy's house and was like chilling with

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.200
his older cousin

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.880
and this is what he says there's like

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.319
two stories but he says that he like

01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:15.760
snuck in the truck and then like got

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.359
there and was like sick i mean i wanted

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:18.880
to meet this guy and they were killing

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.400
someone they're like well we'll kill you

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.079
unless you shoot someone and join up

01:02:22.079 --> 01:02:24.000
with us so from the time he was like he

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.680
said most of the people who kill people

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.319
are like 14 to like 21-ish he's like

01:02:28.319 --> 01:02:29.520
they use a lot of like child soldiers

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.079
yeah so he's like isis used those kids

01:02:32.079 --> 01:02:32.960
yeah

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.240
he was just rolling he was just rolling

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.799
around he's like from like 14 to 21 just

01:02:36.799 --> 01:02:38.640
sorting coke shooting people doing like

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.160
of them i forget them too but the guy

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.680
was basically saying like there's

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.599
certain routes for like smuggling that

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:01.040
like go you know through different

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.119
routes of the um kid in the united

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:05.359

01:03:05.359 --> 01:03:07.280
route it's like you you just [ __ ] run

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.559
everything and that's the whole time

01:03:08.559 --> 01:03:09.440
it's like

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.720
trying to kill each other over out so

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.079
it's like never ending yeah so if they

01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:13.760
were just like we need a wall dude well

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.960
if they were just like well [ __ ] it it's

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.760
all legal and they're done they're fried

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.520
or maybe or if we build a wall to stop

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.880
the cartels dude they're going to dig

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.480
under it it's never going to stop we're

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.160
going to stop them

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.440
we're going to stop we got to build like

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.200
a nice slotted fence we're going to

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.559
we're going to build a wall we're going

01:03:28.559 --> 01:03:30.160
to stop it yeah what happens when the

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.280
wall is there tunnel nope tunnel no we

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.000
increase nail flying it in driving it in

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.060
through mattresses

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.240
[Laughter]

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.000
we're stopping that now if we put dudes

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.480
on atvs behind a wall definitely shut

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.880
down

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.640
one of the cartel i think it wasn't el

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.839
chapo but one of them had a [ __ ]

01:03:47.839 --> 01:03:49.359
submarine

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:51.520
dude these guys have more money than god

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.280
it's unbelievable that's hilarious

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.200
though he has a sub

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.720
there's yeah there was some really

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.400
[ __ ] well known what they really that

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.240
they do is they get um

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.839
i think now this isn't as effective

01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:03.680
because they started used to be able to

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.640
walk across from america into juarez no

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.680
problem and if you're american you're

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.039
like hey i'm american they go go on

01:04:09.039 --> 01:04:11.039
right back so they recruit kids like a

01:04:11.039 --> 01:04:12.400
lot of kids would go to mexico to hang

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.079
out and they'd recruit american mexican

01:04:14.079 --> 01:04:14.960
kids

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.640
to be their little mules and then they

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.920
that way they're back and forth all the

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.920
time and it's like no problem but then

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.520
they use those kids so they recruit

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.440
american mexican kids and then they use

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.599
them to go to the states and kill their

01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:27.119
rivals family who live in the united

01:04:27.119 --> 01:04:28.160
states

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.200
the guy was like i was like going to

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.880
like colleges and like murdering people

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.839
doing really he's like i don't want to

01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:32.960
talk about what i did in the estates it

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.680
was really [ __ ] up yeah there's and

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.680
america is pretty complicit with all

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.119
this [ __ ] like there's banks and [ __ ]

01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:42.799
all along the border and yeah dude real

01:04:42.799 --> 01:04:45.119
yeah it's it's a real problem no but if

01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:46.480
they get that wall up dude it's going to

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.000
be the wall's going to shut down dude

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.319
it's [ __ ] don't use a wall we need a

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:52.000
physical wall

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.319

drugs or like using your millions or

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.480
billions of dollars to maybe start like

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.079
a trucking company and

01:05:02.079 --> 01:05:03.520
outfit trucks with a couple kilos of

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.960
cocaine you'll never get around that one

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.640
not a not a 50 that wall's gonna be a

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.599
[ __ ] x-ray scanner not a 15-foot wall

01:05:09.599 --> 01:05:10.799
you're not getting around that with a

01:05:10.799 --> 01:05:12.400
million dollars

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.160
that drives me [ __ ] crazy that's a

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.240
bad one well that sounds sick if you

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.680

at that this has definitely been said

01:08:12.319 --> 01:08:14.240
before by someone but it's like the idea

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.640
of like like we need girls around they

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.640
like run everything and it's like

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.960

all girls to run it if it's a [ __ ]

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.199
bake sale

01:08:31.199 --> 01:08:32.799
but we need men i don't understand why

01:08:32.799 --> 01:08:33.600
they think

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.359
girls gonna run everything and it's just

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:37.279
like if girls ran stuff we wouldn't be

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.199

there been female dictatorships

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.480
like one rock to the head

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.960
okay okay okay sorry uh

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.880

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.239
maybe i don't know she was a strong

01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:17.359
white woman

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:19.279

[Laughter]

01:09:22.799 --> 01:09:25.440
whiter than she was black she was white

01:09:27.679 --> 01:09:29.040
it cracks me up it's like i know that

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.880
for a fact put [ __ ] 30 chicks in a

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.520
room for six months it's like

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.279
i you're not gonna see peace and harmony

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:37.120

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.480
are you doing this i'm just saying i

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.920
hate right i read this [ __ ] all the time

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.679
it's time for women to be in charge and

01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:42.960
it's like

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.319
you guys probably were at some point

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:45.920
dude

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.400
yeah probably not really yeah not really

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.960
i don't know i hope queens and [ __ ] yeah

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.839
but

01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:54.159
true there's probably some strong stable

01:09:54.159 --> 01:09:57.040
boy giving him a [ __ ] good play

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.239
good job

01:09:58.239 --> 01:10:00.159
just a classic plunge

01:10:00.159 --> 01:10:02.159
but yeah that does crack me up it's like

01:10:02.159 --> 01:10:03.679
i just don't see women interacting that

01:10:03.679 --> 01:10:05.360
friendly with each other well here's the

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.640
weird thing a lot of these liberals are

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.560
like edgy liberals

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.400

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.159
because they all and just like facebook

don't be doing that

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.760
but um

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.679
they they all post like dumb [ __ ]

01:10:39.679 --> 01:10:41.760
republicans are saying yeah which is

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.080
bountiful there's a million dumb [ __ ]

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.199
things republicans are saying because

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.760
republicans are pretty [ __ ] dumb yeah

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.760
like death penalty to [ __ ] people who

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.840

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.520
build a wall all that [ __ ]

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.360
but it's it's just so [ __ ]

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.280
hypocritical on both sides constantly

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.640
it's like yeah you could go find a

01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.760
republican website where they do the

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.600
same with the left because the left is

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.920
doing and saying dumb [ __ ] all day also

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.280
even if they're not the dude the obama

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.760

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.960
don't have uh to pick a side that hard

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.120
makes you a [ __ ] idiot in my opinion

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.800
are we like

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:23.920
dude i mean i know you don't like

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.440
evolutionary science but like we're

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.120
evolving to being like i just don't like

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.560
people that picked up evolutionary

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.400
science this year we're evolving i've

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.080
been into this we're involved to be in

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.520
the tight-knit little like tribal

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.600
communities and it's like we're totally

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.520
[ __ ] and fragmented and all over

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.120
happiness comes from consumption so it's

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.960
like of course we're on cnn [ __ ]

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.560
yelling at each other yeah you sound

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.960
like sebastian younger

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.280
i bailed on his book that was kind of

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.199
boring yeah he was just a super rich

01:11:49.199 --> 01:11:52.000
dude who was like my life was hard

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.840
yeah but we're [ __ ] like we're totally

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.360
[ __ ] up

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.880
no we're not steven you're like you know

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.320
things are going great

01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.520
i mean they

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.520
kind of maybe i don't know imagine

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.400
living

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.600
back in the day when you had to plunge

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.520
come out of people true things things

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.040
are good right that's tough but i think

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.960
that we hit like a nice happy medium and

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.800
then kind of just like

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.080
started getting fun is your appendix

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.080
used to eat [ __ ]

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.480
what was your appendix what was that for

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.640
my appendix oh the thing that like is in

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.560
my body that was for process raw meat

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.640
bro now now we don't need it yeah cause

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:23.840
i don't we don't eat raw meat anymore

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.760
that's what it's for theory some people

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.600
say that's that's a good theory pretty

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.920
tight i heard it was the processed grass

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:32.239
really grass i tried i told you i tried

01:12:32.239 --> 01:12:34.239
to eat grass once nice when i was a

01:12:34.239 --> 01:12:35.760
young boy i see grass when i was a

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.280
little kid it's disgusting dude yeah

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.560
tastes like [ __ ] i remember being like

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.920
dude if i can just start eating grass i

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.360
can just eat wherever i'm at and i ate

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.880
like a two blades and i was like nope

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.480
[ __ ] this i mean pop tarts do this

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.480
yeah i don't know i don't know what to

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.640
think about this episode so far whatever

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.679
it's good

01:12:51.679 --> 01:12:52.960
yeah it's fun

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.640
get it out there i'd like to hear your

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.000
thoughts though i like that i think it's

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.840
important for the listeners to get a

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.520
hold of some theories i mean dude it's

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.120
because you covered you covered

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.040
everything they covered a lot of groups

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:06.159
no doubt [ __ ] ecology yeah well no just

01:13:06.159 --> 01:13:07.760
old ecology

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.440
so you're saying new ecology has they

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.120
sorted itself out new ecology knows

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.040
what's going on now oh they just were

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.480
founded on like completely false

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.239
assumption it's kind of like every other

01:13:16.239 --> 01:13:17.120
field

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.400
yeah pretty much

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.200
no like definitely yeah

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.600
[Music]

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.920
what else is founded on

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.440
the earth was flat

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.800
i mean literally every true that hasn't

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.640
been literally

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.560
no but literally every single yeah dude

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:31.840
i'm not hating on the field of ecology

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.080
but that that idea from ecology still

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.600
lives that's my point

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.719
you know what i mean people if you say

01:13:36.719 --> 01:13:37.760
the earth's flat people like you're a

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.520
[ __ ] idiot but like when you say the

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:40.800
balance of nature everyone goes like

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.239
yeah [ __ ] yeah

01:13:42.239 --> 01:13:43.440
really

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.239
yeah

01:13:44.239 --> 01:13:46.080
i think a lot of people are like talking

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.199
about the balance of nature and being

01:13:47.199 --> 01:13:49.120
like yeah [ __ ] yeah yeah dude what is

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.239
the balance

01:13:50.239 --> 01:13:51.520
exactly i don't want to get into this

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.960
again exactly

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:55.280
because that's my current my biggest

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.719
warm brain right this i've had this for

01:13:56.719 --> 01:13:58.880
a while is the fact that

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.480
all all of our happiness supposed to

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.920
come from buying [ __ ] so it's like

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.199
that's my biggest boring brain right now

01:14:05.199 --> 01:14:07.120
i think we're [ __ ] when i when i'm out

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.239
and i see people just like on their

01:14:08.239 --> 01:14:09.920
phones just like no one talks to each

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:12.159
other i just think we're [ __ ] dude

01:14:12.159 --> 01:14:13.440
we're just slow we're going to slow

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.040
drain down dude and you don't want to

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.080
say your dicks a plunger

01:14:18.719 --> 01:14:20.880
well see i don't know because the whole

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.600
everybody on their phone thing

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.679
i don't know there's been a lot of it's

01:14:25.679 --> 01:14:26.960
been throughout history that people have

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.679
looked at technology and innovation

01:14:29.679 --> 01:14:31.280
negatively

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:32.719
like people just sitting there watching

01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:36.080
tv all day that's bad or like

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.520
books when books came out they're like

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.800
what are you just sitting in your room

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.400
reading you should be out talking to

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.800
people not learning yeah i mean think of

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.080
how much you can do with your phone

01:14:46.719 --> 01:14:49.040
social networking is the phone the i'm

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.120
not against phones social media is a

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.800
part of it that i think is like [ __ ]

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.159
up and weird it is it is weird but it

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:57.760
might not be [ __ ] up but never know i

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.719
mean they've definitely they've done

01:14:58.719 --> 01:15:00.560
studies to where like it's not good for

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.600
you at all

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.280
but again it's scientific theory but

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.960
they've charted like suicides this and

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.640
that and a lot of it coincides with

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.400
social media

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.400
like an increase in suicides

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.719
maybe i think it's [ __ ] up

01:15:12.719 --> 01:15:14.000
it's a whole other life it's like you

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.280
have your life then you have this other

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.960
life on a [ __ ] digital platform they

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.360
have to tend to whoa exactly maybe

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.360
that's preparing us to

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.600
shed our [ __ ] we're in a cocoon right

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.120
now dude

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.880
we're just humans in a cocoon true that

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.640
we're just we're ready to ascend to the

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.640
point where we coexist with technology

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.480
entirely it's the matrix

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.920
yeah that is funny to think of people

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.360
like i would never join it's like dude

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.840
you're in it

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.040
basically you're basically one foot in

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.199
the [ __ ] not at all no you're not a

01:15:41.199 --> 01:15:42.640
little bit

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.000
a little bit yeah one foot in the

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.400
[ __ ] water tank

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.239
what for having a facebook page it's

01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:50.320
facebook [ __ ] tv it's like you don't

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.320
really no one really does anything so

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.600
you just like buy different stuff yeah

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.440
because we've evolved to the point where

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.560
we don't need to be out in the [ __ ]

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.159
woods running from [ __ ] i'm not saying

01:15:58.159 --> 01:15:59.679
that that that's bad i'm not saying i'm

01:15:59.679 --> 01:16:01.600
against trust if you were out running in

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.040
the woods you'd be like man i wish i was

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.040
sitting on a couch watching tv i wish we

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.800
could all live like that that'd be nice

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.640
true but i'm saying that there's a

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.560
middle ground that people are missing

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.679
it's where you're still excited and

01:16:11.679 --> 01:16:13.120
running around and then you don't go

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.880
home and just sit on [ __ ]

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.880
facebook and read people's sauce all day

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.320
yeah that's bad because no one's it's

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.920
like to me it's like yeah it's like

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.199
that's all i see when i go out in public

01:16:21.199 --> 01:16:22.560
now and i see people actively

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.719
snapchatting it's it's freaks me the

01:16:24.719 --> 01:16:26.560
[ __ ] out yeah it's a little annoying

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.480
like just watching that dunk contest

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.760

01:16:40.159 --> 01:16:41.679
on speaker phone and held it up to their

know you could use headphones i actually

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.560
did learn that from black people that

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.000
you could use the apple headphones and

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.440
talk on the phone

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.360
but not talking

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.800
it's like craziest thing it's a strange

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.719
conversation both on the phone

01:17:10.719 --> 01:17:12.239

that's something i didn't know that that

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.679
part of the i thought was like the

01:17:25.679 --> 01:17:26.880
volume control i didn't know you could

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.640
speak into that yeah until i would see

black people food shopping and it's

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.040
being like

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.000
yup

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.280

dude black people phone is such a

01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.600
mystery i've always wondered about that

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.360
because i'm like being a walkie-talkie

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.280
it's just on and you both go about your

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.440
day yeah but it's bizarre it's like it's

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.199
the weirdest [ __ ] thing i always

01:18:07.199 --> 01:18:08.480
wondered like i was when i first

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.920
encountered that i was like is that like

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.080
a

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.600
like a self-conscious thing are they

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.880
like kind of is that like a way to deal

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.640
with social anxiety or like you just

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:17.760
call someone and then you're just like

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:20.159
walking around like [ __ ] acme i don't

01:18:20.159 --> 01:18:21.440
know it seems like it's just the

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.040
ultimate not giving

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.880
girlfriends that [ __ ] annoying to

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.960
where they can't go anywhere

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.640
without like staying on the phone the

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.640
whole time

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.760
do you think it's a girlfriend probably

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.679

01:18:33.679 --> 01:18:35.440
things i know i get dubbed a racist a

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.280
lot from you because that's you're a

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.440
liberal marxist yeah but i'm open to

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.719
being if someone's like yeah i'll be up

01:18:40.719 --> 01:18:42.640

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.560
i'll burn off any old part of myself

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.800
dude that's just classic

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.360
yes you're like a phoenix basically dude

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.280
but no i mean that's true that's yeah

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:52.239
something i gotta work on thanks for

01:18:52.239 --> 01:18:54.640
putting that out shane yeah no problem

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.320

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:56.850
a girl

01:18:56.850 --> 01:19:01.040
[Laughter]

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.400
that is something i yeah dude that's

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.760
i've noticed that and i'm always like

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.440
wow what the [ __ ] is that i mean that's

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.560
like the question black people on the

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.239
phone thing that's the classic walk in

01:19:08.239 --> 01:19:09.679
the middle of the street when there's

01:19:09.679 --> 01:19:11.520
snow on the sidewalks i'm like

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.280
i'm snowing the sidewalks i'm like june

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.640
also i see a lot of black people who

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.560
walk not in the middle of the street but

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.239
they don't use the sidewalk they use

01:19:18.239 --> 01:19:19.440
they just like

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.320
scurry amongst the cars i'm always

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.480
i saw a lady actually scurry she was

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.480
[ __ ] walking very minimalistic term

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.239
it's a demeaning turn it's scurry dude i

01:19:28.239 --> 01:19:30.239
can scurry it's just a demeaning term

01:19:30.239 --> 01:19:31.199
it's usually

01:19:31.199 --> 01:19:32.320
here's the thing

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.520
it's not a stroll i'll tell you that

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.880
it's a [ __ ] you're over the middle of

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.719
the street i see some strolls

01:19:36.719 --> 01:19:38.000
i see some hardships in the middle of

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.679
the street across the street i think

01:19:39.679 --> 01:19:40.719
that's the only way i would describe i

01:19:40.719 --> 01:19:41.360
think

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.040
the middle of the story implies that

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.040
they're almost being polite to the cars

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.480
they're like oh [ __ ] i gotta cross for

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.239
you yeah i've missed saying that's gonna

01:19:48.239 --> 01:19:49.360
stroll across

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:50.560
here's what i think it is i think the

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.640
sidewalk is like the slow lane for black

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.640
pedestrians and like the side of the

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.480
road is the it's a speed lane if you're

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.600
like a black dude you're in a rush you

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.679
just [ __ ] take the [ __ ] you take

01:19:59.679 --> 01:20:01.840
the side of the road

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:04.000
i see i i've asked people about that

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.520
because it's perplexed me i don't get an

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.960
answer i don't i've never had black i

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.480
think one guy explained it to me i just

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.840
i forget what he said what why black

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.199
people i asked him like what's over

01:20:11.199 --> 01:20:12.400
trump yeah like why do you guys walk in

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.000
the [ __ ] street and i've had most

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.120
people go i don't know man i don't

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.480
really understand that either

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:17.440
it is

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.679
that's very perplexing

01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:21.199
i'd love to get some feedback if anyone

01:20:21.199 --> 01:20:21.920
knows

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.159
you know black listeners

01:20:24.159 --> 01:20:25.120
please

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.040
please why do you guys cross the street

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.120
like that and i also i did crack the

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.960
socks at the water park thing

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.280
what's that for some reason a lot of

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.600
black people don't like their

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.280
if your country that's one thing but a

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.880
lot of like the from like the cities and

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:41.120
like east coast black kids don't like

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.719
their feet touching the ground because

01:20:42.719 --> 01:20:44.800
i've from dating people and having

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:45.840
girlfriends and [ __ ] and meeting their

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.840
families like very japanese black people

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.280
no they don't like their bare feet

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.800
touching the outside world then when you

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.480
get inside it is kind of japanese you

01:22:33.679 --> 01:22:35.040
level of like

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.120
super whiteness when it's just like

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.960
patagonia jacket

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.800
you've never touched like a rake in your

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.639
life like there's white people who are

01:22:42.639 --> 01:22:44.239
like beyond

01:22:44.239 --> 01:22:45.920
beyond like we're obviously white and

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:48.880
pretty very white no but there's like

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.880
a level of whiteness that like you and i

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:59.199
i i'm looked at as scum on some level

01:22:59.199 --> 01:23:01.360
and like the white [ __ ] pyramid

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.520
but when you see like a super fun like

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.960

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:12.960
yeah

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:14.560
the high rubber rain boots

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.080
yeah i'm telling you i've seen like a

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.360
white fan with a dad's wearing high

like pushed them a little bit yeah but

01:23:24.639 --> 01:23:26.080
no i've seen that for sure i think it's

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.320
just being rich as [ __ ] really yeah

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.080

01:23:32.159 --> 01:23:36.639
like uncomfortably white dude yeah what

01:23:36.639 --> 01:23:39.360
what this this is sketchy around here

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.340
like jaden smith

01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:44.080

he is the fresh prince of bel air how

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.280
ironic is that jaden smith he's

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:48.560
basically the fresh prince of bel-air

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.560

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.840
he sucks he's pretty bad dude you have

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:58.320
no [ __ ] grasp on reality your dad's

01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:59.679
your dad

01:23:59.679 --> 01:24:01.679
is a movie star and then you're born

01:24:01.679 --> 01:24:03.600

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.760
ever compare it well smith sucks too

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.040
right now he's doing all these like

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.480
internet videos

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.000
oh he's getting real like tyrese

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
promotional yeah or like

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.080
i actually saw a uh it's real weird i

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:20.080
saw a security guard watching will smith

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.679
piper like hump her up the other day or

01:24:21.679 --> 01:24:23.600

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.719
bad one too

01:24:24.719 --> 01:24:26.320
pump her up i was watching this i was

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.320
watching a lady like a girl i walked by

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.840
yeah i walked by a security desk and i

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.360
like caught a glimpse of this computer

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.480
and it was just was she thick

01:24:34.639 --> 01:24:36.719
i don't remember honestly it wasn't a

01:24:36.719 --> 01:24:38.320
thick security guard

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.920
i don't remember black lady security

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.080
guards tend to be thick as [ __ ] true

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:44.000
but i don't think she was particularly i

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.840
don't think i've ever seen a fit i think

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.000
she was in training a skinny black

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
security guard in my life

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.480
ah it's a black lady behind a desk

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.000
it depends how many the years they got

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.679
on him man i know but that's a thick

01:24:55.679 --> 01:24:57.600
that's a thick guard yeah i mean that's

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.600
that's a [ __ ] that's pretty unanimous

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.000
or unanimous around security guards

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.440
yeah i mean they put the years in man

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.840
you get i mean if you sit on the night

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.600
shift anywhere yeah true but there's not

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.679
that many white lady security guards

01:25:09.679 --> 01:25:10.800
there's not

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.239
so that you i'm sure they would have

01:25:12.239 --> 01:25:13.679
seen a couple i'm sure they could be

01:25:13.679 --> 01:25:15.440
thick no i've seen a couple and they get

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.600
pretty haggard yeah that's [ __ ]

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.440
that's a tough job dude like low level

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.960
security unless you're a

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.199
black lady that sits there like

01:25:23.199 --> 01:25:25.199
i need to see that face dude

01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:26.560
i can't i can't jump on board with it

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.639
yet you'll see it i know i'm gonna look

01:25:28.639 --> 01:25:31.760
for it it's it's raised eyebrows

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.560
shut mouth i just get high fives

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.239
yeah i just get high fives what do you

01:25:36.239 --> 01:25:37.760
mean like when i see black people

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.800
usually just hook me up with like a high

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.080
five oh for sure i'm not saying that's

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.000
how they say hi i'm just saying

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.120
oh you're i think you're saying as

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.320
you're resting

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.400
as a walk by like i think you're saying

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.600
you look at white people when we walk by

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.360
they do that like no no no whatever it's

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.719
like you just did it

01:25:50.719 --> 01:25:52.639
yeah we all do it it's very easy the

01:25:52.639 --> 01:25:54.480
best way to describe it is uh it's like

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.320
an elevated door closing

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.920
and someone's they're like you say hi to

01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.520
somebody like

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.280
oh yeah yeah yeah but i'm not saying

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.560
that's i'm saying so it's a double

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.480
eyebrow raised kind of mouth shut just

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:06.000
kind of like

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.679
like i see that you're saying hi to me

01:26:07.679 --> 01:26:09.120
i'm not returning no no it has nothing

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:12.000
to do with okay a salutation got you

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.639
it's just strictly just a resting black

01:26:14.639 --> 01:26:17.520
face rbf that i've seen

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:20.000
oh time and time again there's no it's a

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.679
physical guy you have to you have to

01:26:21.679 --> 01:26:23.600
manipulate your face to make the face

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.360
it's not like a resting face but what

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.560
about this is a white face a resting

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:27.840
face because that's just no it has

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.040
nothing to do with that i'm saying that

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.960
was an observation that's a face white

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.800
people make it's a default this is a

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.639
face black people make sometimes but to

01:26:34.639 --> 01:26:36.400
express what are they trying to promote

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.320
is it just kind of like in like standard

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.080
stuff i see it in uh

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.840
basketball a lot

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.400
on the bench no like on the court you

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.040
know it's a weird

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.800
yeah i gotta check it out i'll show you

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.159
it's so it's just like a it's like a

01:26:52.159 --> 01:26:54.000
screensaver for it it is blackface

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.679
that's exactly the perfect example

01:26:55.679 --> 01:26:57.280
gotcha it's like a real [ __ ] i don't

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.239
give a [ __ ] face

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:02.560
i've always always felt bad seeing

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.159
rappers getting interviewed a lot yeah

01:27:04.159 --> 01:27:06.639
i've always felt bad for uh

01:27:06.639 --> 01:27:08.719
you know those who have a young black

01:27:08.719 --> 01:27:11.199
men not being able to smile in pictures

01:27:11.199 --> 01:27:14.639
from like age 15 to like 25 or so well i

01:27:14.639 --> 01:27:16.159
think that's what it comes from yeah i

01:27:16.159 --> 01:27:17.600
cause i like see you i have friends and

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.639
i go on their facebook and i would just

01:27:18.639 --> 01:27:19.679

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.679
drug war theory about the culture of

01:27:41.679 --> 01:27:43.600
terror in the inner cities but

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.360
that's what being woke is though is

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.280
being aware of well being truly well if

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:52.719

not woke though v woke no yeah uv woke

01:27:58.639 --> 01:28:00.000

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.159
all the time

01:28:10.159 --> 01:28:14.159
just from you and one other person

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.960
where are we at we got to be well over

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.360

yeah this is good

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.639
dude this is this is some good stuff

01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:26.159
good no i agree it's coming from the

01:28:26.159 --> 01:28:29.360
[ __ ] you're just this is like just it

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.880
doesn't make sense though as like why

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.639
black kids can't smile why they don't

01:28:32.639 --> 01:28:33.600
smile

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.880
because it's like you're just a [ __ ]

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.320
[ __ ] if you smile on pictures you have

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.520
to be like

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:40.480
like number one sign frown be like it's

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:42.560
just a weird idea to do to take a

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.560
picture just like hold up let me [ __ ]

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.400
instead of like i'm like [ __ ] i gotta

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.920
smile real quick i gotta do some weird

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.199
[ __ ] it's like worrying about your face

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:51.520
but being like

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.120
you gotta look nasty dude that's what i

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.639
was saying in that [ __ ] when i did

01:28:54.639 --> 01:28:56.560
that show last week what there's there's

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:57.760
a it was a black show so there was a

01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.600
photographer uh-huh and like he's

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.280
snapping pictures of people i can't i

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.719
don't know how to act you don't know how

01:29:02.719 --> 01:29:07.440
to appear iconic yeah like skeet

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.960
skeet was standing there next to me at

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.639
the bar and the photographer comes by

01:29:10.639 --> 01:29:12.480
and he's like hey yo

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.400
i requested the photographer to take a

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.159
picture of him standing at the bar

01:29:16.159 --> 01:29:18.320
did a [ __ ] pose and then just went

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.440
back to talking to me like it was

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.040
nothing yeah i wonder about that and

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.480
then anytime he took a picture of me i

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.000
just i couldn't make a real face i had

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
to make a funny face i [ __ ] it was so

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.120
awkward like i'm sitting there at a

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.400
table and he's trying to get a picture

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.480
of me like laughing in the crowd and i

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.719
was like i guess you have to be like uh

01:29:32.719 --> 01:29:33.840
that's funny if you're like we got a

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.440
white guy laughing yeah yeah yeah it's i

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:37.600
wonder uh

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.120
maybe if the more you think about your

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:42.159
legacy the more you get into like photos

01:29:42.159 --> 01:29:43.760
to where like you'd be like

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.120
people are going to see this one day and

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.239
where people take pictures of me i'm

01:29:46.239 --> 01:29:48.080
like [ __ ] someone throws that out

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.440
[ __ ] it looks like you're fighting

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:52.880
off paparazzi yeah

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.719
or it's just a weird fake smile where

01:29:54.719 --> 01:29:56.639
i'm like i think a part of me is like

01:29:56.639 --> 01:29:58.320
people are gonna see this i don't wanna

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.159

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:34.639
confusing

01:32:34.639 --> 01:32:36.239
yeah i think so too

01:32:36.239 --> 01:32:38.080
i think it is for sure no one knows

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:40.400
what's going on um

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:41.600

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.719
things to

01:32:42.719 --> 01:32:45.280
that i wanted i forgot

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:46.560

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.880
yeah dude [ __ ] dates i can't think of

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.080
anything else

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.000
this is about when people i think on two

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.920
apples start going yeah this is where

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:55.280
you miss a lot of stuff because we start

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.400
to trail off here and then there's

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.920
usually something that's true somebody

01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.840

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.400

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.080
are hitting the brakes yeah we're done

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.530
