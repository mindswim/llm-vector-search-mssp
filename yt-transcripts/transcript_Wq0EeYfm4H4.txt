00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:20.720
yeah that's a whole other issue do we

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.639
rip off barack courages sometimes

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:24.990
maybe

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.959
[Music]

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:29.519
have we ever ripped off a cheney

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:32.160
oh yes

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:37.760
all right oh my god this so i did uh

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.680
so you did the voice and the voice and

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.920
then during my set i did a joke about uh

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.240
everybody says they're not racist

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.839
and then i say being racist isn't like a

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:49.519
yes or no thing being racist is like

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:51.519
being hungry sure you're not hungry

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:53.200
right now but a cheeseburger could cut

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.480
you off in traffic and you could get

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.720
hungry yeah and then

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.560
people kind of laugh and then i say if

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.320
it helps the cheeseburger is asian does

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.839
that help you feel comfortable with that

00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:03.760
joke and people laugh because it seems

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.040
like the cheeseburger i'm talking about

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.360
is a black person yeah at which point

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.600
the joke is racist exactly but then when

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.360
i point out the fact that if it was

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.279
asian you wouldn't be offended well and

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:15.199
i've seen it a bunch of times in action

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:16.720
the joke works regardless but then

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.000
usually when you hit the cheeseburger

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.519
line saying he's asian

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:21.519
yeah everyone says the point of that

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:23.760
joke is to point out the double standard

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.040
that

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.199
it's a it's it's racist for us to laugh

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.560
it is

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.160
if it is a break a cheeseburger

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.720
oh very barracka cheeseburger

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.160
so if the cheeseburger is black it's

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.680
racist but then if i make it asian

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.199
everyone's comfortable with white people

00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:40.399
are comfortable to laugh at it

00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:41.680
definitely which i'm pointing out the

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.880
fact that that's a double standard

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.639
well you might be too subversive for

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:48.160
your own good maybe but i think it's

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.760
pretty clear when i say does that make

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.600
it better yeah like i'm saying if the

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.279
cheeseburger is asian does that help i

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:55.519
think the whole thing is just that like

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.600
so like an sjw sitting in the crowd the

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.600
soup's already rotten dude sure you said

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.600
cheeseburger now they're gone

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.920
you say asian they just go yes that's

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.920
exactly what happened

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.760
they misinterpreted it

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.800
and they took it two stops this time

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.760
yeah exactly exactly they do the [ __ ]

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.440
cha-cha slide of oppression dude they're

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.920
just like oh

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.720
but uh so then i

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.079
they did this interview thing because it

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:24.079
was a game show or like a show you had

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:26.240
three you had three angles two angry you

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.959
had three angry girls in the

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:30.160
dead front row so it was like the

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.600
muppets instead of old men it was just

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.760
two angry asian ladies looking down

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.360
they're very pretty young they were

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.880
young too that was a problem they were

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.680
like probably mid to early 20s so they

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.760
were just primed for like

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.360
he should not be talking about our race

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.800
this week so they were just like they

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.440
were full on [ __ ] like but again they

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.800
were they were still they weren't doing

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.480
anything wrong yeah they were offended

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.320
by what i had said but they weren't

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.600
saying anything

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.880
but i just didn't think it was funny

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.959
which is fine like i wasn't mad at them

00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:59.040
for that that's that happens all the

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.720
time you're allowed to

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.320
people get yeah people either not get it

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.800
or not think it's funny true so that's

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.560
fine i had no problem with that but then

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.680
when they do this interview thing

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.040
afterwards i was joking with the fact

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.800
that they didn't like me yeah i was like

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.360
these three did not like me at all

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.480
and i was like now that we're in the

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.560
open q a session i figured i'd address

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.160
that maybe break the ice and i did kind

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.600
of they started to laugh

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.279
and i'd done an australian joke so that

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:23.040
one of the hosts was like yeah they

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.920
probably didn't like you because they're

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.199
australian

00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:27.199
and i was like i don't think that's it

00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:29.440
it's probably because they're asians

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.120
and that and that was what made them

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.560
very upset

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.079
but that was the truth of the matter

00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:36.170
yeah well don't don't just say the truth

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.839
[Laughter]

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:39.759
but no i and then and then i got off

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:41.839
stage and i was like man i i do feel bad

00:16:41.839 --> 00:16:43.040
i didn't want to

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.480
[ __ ] actually hurt their feelings

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.240
yeah like it hurts more too when they're

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.920
hot yeah you want to hurt hot chicks

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.839
feelings you're like no i'm wrong well i

00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:51.759
just knew it was a miscommunication yeah

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:53.839
and i was the only one talking so it was

00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:56.720
on me so like i felt bad i was like

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.240
i felt bad i didn't want to hurt their

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.279
feelings

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.480
so i was like i think i'm gonna go

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.920
apologize to them and then a female

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.279
comic that was on the show with me was

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:05.280
like those are actually my roommates i

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.039
think they'd be open to you apologizing

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:09.120
to them i was like yeah i can do that

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.480
for sure i was thinking about it i was

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.160
like i don't want to rehash it make it

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.600
weirder than it has to be maybe it

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.199
wasn't that weird maybe it's just my

00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:16.880
head and she was like no i think it'd be

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.000
good if you did and i was like alright

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.799
cool

00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:20.720
i can probably do that yeah and then i

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.360
was like if i want to sure yeah

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.000
so then i'm standing there

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.439
and then that same female comment comes

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:29.039
walking back in and it's like

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:30.320
okay now they're out front you can go

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.160
apologize to them jesus christ i was

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.160
like she's on like a headset right now

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.840
oh he's coming out yeah then she walked

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.799
back and approached me and was like

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:39.120
they're outside you can go apologize

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.720
you should apologize but she basically

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.640
was like go apologize she's pretty much

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.919
shoving you out the door yeah i was like

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:45.919
oh man now i really don't want to yeah

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:48.559
it's crazy that's a normal reaction but

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:49.840
so then i went out and i was like hey

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.000

i've never had to apologize for those

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:11.760

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.679
whole point of digital graffiti to be as

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:57.919

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.640
definitely not gonna ever resolve itself

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.000

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.360
well dude you could literally

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.000
i guess it doesn't matter it's all right

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.480
i'm racist and sexist and homophobic so

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.880
i mean dude it's it's brand over common

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.640
sense and his brand is to be an ally

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.960
their brand excuse me the club the

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.679
theater's brand is like

00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:00.080
this is you know they're not

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.000
that type of comedy isn't meant yeah and

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.520
by that type of comedy i mean if it's

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.600
coming from a straight white guy exactly

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.280
if i was anything else saying exactly

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.400
the same stuff

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.559
if anyone complains yeah i mean like if

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:12.720
they had it's just it's just you know

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.000
that's that's their product you go in

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.919
there and it's just that's what it is

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:16.720
so

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.080
yeah i mean it's not even about if you

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.679
got if you were friends or whatever it's

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:22.080
like even if you guys were best friends

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.919
as soon as people were like i don't know

00:22:23.919 --> 00:22:25.520

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.600

two-handed and like stuff in a beer

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.919
whether or not she should do it again

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.000
you have to do is listen to anyone any

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.679
one of our podcasts and be like oh yeah

00:27:53.679 --> 00:27:56.000
he's pretty great i tone it down so much

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.159
on stage compared to this well i mean

00:27:58.159 --> 00:27:59.360
plus two you get a lot of people on

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.960
stage and i mean this is a classic role

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.320
version it never works but there's like

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.080
i watch black comics all the time like

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.919
fun do white guy voice and i'm always

00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:07.919
like hilarious yeah love watching black

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:10.000
dudes do white guy voice it just makes

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.480
me laugh my god it makes me laugh so

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.440
hard

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.440
well hello yeah

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.120
officer yeah it's always like calling

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.520
the cops well i don't i don't so i i

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.200
realize there's no correlate i mean the

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.760
correlation is very thin between black

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.880
comics

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.840
it's foggy but there's enough people

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.440
every single comic

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.520
like literally saying white guys are

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.440
evil

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.360
and it doesn't seem to be that much of a

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.200
joke in it

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.399
you know what i mean like people go on

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:39.840
stage and be like straight white men

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.960
should not be in power and it's like

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.960
all right if i started [ __ ] talking

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.559
about like rupert murdoch and all that

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:48.080
[ __ ] people be like yo bro chill the

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.279
[ __ ] out yeah but i mean that's just

00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:50.480
what it is

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.320
it was they were there were people that

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.600
were upset

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.000
because you said it good because i said

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.600
welcome to a good good comedy

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.279
but uh

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:02.799
they were yeah again they it wasn't a

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:04.320
big deal no

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.039
it and i i was wrong in that they were

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:07.840
upset

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.039
they probably were charged they probably

00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:10.960
went super scion mode on facebook all

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.200
caps outraged yeah that was they were

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.240
definitely

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.320
they they were reaching to get offended

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.000
on that they were reaching

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.559
this one straight a little like tears

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:22.080
anime teardrop hit the corner of their

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:22.630
head like

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.640
[Music]

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.039
i was just

00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:35.360
oh see that's funny it is funny that's

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.679
hilarious but

00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:40.399
some places you just yeah i don't know

00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:42.720
it's it sucks because i i was

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.799
it happened it all changed with the the

00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:47.279
political climate yeah if trump didn't

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:49.600
win when i first moved here everything

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.760
was cool yeah and everybody got along

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.720
and everything was fine and then uh

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.640
politics and all that like political

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.000
correctness and people being

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.799
anti-politically correct and like

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.559
because both sides are equal not equal

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:04.080
but both sides are pretty wrong on a lot

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.080
of [ __ ] yeah like there's a ton of

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.640
[ __ ] morons on the anti-pc [ __ ]

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.919
side that are like

00:30:09.919 --> 00:30:11.360
well it's just the whole thing's just

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.720
like a cell so it's it's like a

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.399
self-calibrating mechanism it's like you

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:16.000
have weirdos on the left and right and

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.679
they have to just kind of argue to so

00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:19.679
that this doesn't fly off the rails

00:30:19.679 --> 00:30:21.200
either way and especially in comedy

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.480
where 95 of these people are complete

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.720
[ __ ] weirdos yeah and i mean i'm

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.240
sitting across from a guy who comes on

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.559
his own laptop exactly who seems pretty

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:32.240
normal and that's that's a community

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.679
you're actually normal

00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:35.039
i'm like really well killed among

00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:37.039
comedians and it's like

00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:39.279
it is funny dude and it's also even just

00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:41.039
like people who

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.720
when people talk like they have a huge

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.640
handle on politics who like

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.480
don't work in politics i'm always kind

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.399
of in my head like you're just jerking

00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:50.799
yourself off yeah like to think that you

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:52.399
a [ __ ] waiter or whatever you do or

00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:54.000
just sitting at home and you got grasp

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.159

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.919
argument

00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:13.039
both sides usually have decent

00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:15.039

stop [ __ ] worrying about like pc

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:20.640
[ __ ] [ __ ] when it comes to comedy

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.240
yeah because it doesn't affect you and

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.320
it really doesn't in clubs

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.640
or like at any place really other than

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.480
local showcases that's the only place

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.360
that

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.760
yeah you got like uh

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.279
you got another good 20 years before you

00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:35.200
got to worry about like those

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.679
two ladies being like 35 year old or i

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:39.039
guess would be like more like 15 years

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:40.399
but when they're like the 40 year olds

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:42.559
at bananas sitting there like but by

00:32:42.559 --> 00:32:44.240
then the whole landscape will be so

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.200
different like bananas will be out of

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.279
business in 15 years i don't know how

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:48.960

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.799
[ __ ] landmark banana's been there

i've heard of bananas

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.279
they have because it's outside of new

00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:11.279

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:15.360
when

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.760
perhaps but this one is is it's outside

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.039
of new york so they just get new york

00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:21.039

[ __ ] everybody yeah it's [ __ ] huge

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.039
my thing is that in 15 years

00:33:27.039 --> 00:33:28.240
like when

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.279
all the college kids are like 35 40

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:33.600
then it'll be it'll be weird unless of

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.960
course these people are going to grow up

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.000
a little

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.200
yeah that's the other thing too like

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.200
words can't hurt you

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.360
i don't know that'll be funny

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.120
it'll be funny to see 50 year olds who

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.960
are being like what what did he say and

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.799
it'll just be like oh man well i think

00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:48.720
once you turn 50

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.519
your parents die you lose a kid yeah you

00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:53.039
[ __ ] life hits you in the dick hard

00:33:53.039 --> 00:33:55.279
enough that you're like did he just say

00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:58.320
that the cheeseburger was asian

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.240
yeah it's like oh yeah my parents died

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.960
of cancer so yeah i can handle this joke

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.000
yeah

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.519
young kids i think are the ones who are

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:06.640
like

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.560
that's not the way the world should be

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.839
yeah i was like that one she wanted to

00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:12.079
not be a guy up there saying that that's

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:14.000
[ __ ] up

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.359
it's like that's why he's saying it

00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:16.639
because it's [ __ ] up yeah and it's

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:17.919
funny it's kind of that's the other

00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:19.440
thing too it's like

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.119
you're just a jackass like if you're a

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:22.960
comedian you should just be a jackass

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.079
and you're like trying to make people

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:24.960
laugh

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.480
be like no i'm a comedian but i'm also

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.079
going to diagnose the world's ills and

00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:29.359
it's like even though that's exactly

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:30.960
what i did

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.320
yeah that's you i think you're retro i

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.839
think you've retroactively thrown that

00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:34.879
on there i think you're just like it

00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:36.320

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.480
literally the first time i said it was

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.839

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:47.280
time you ever did it really the white

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.560

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.880
i'm not a serial killer that just showed

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.880
me a video on his laptop and this is the

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.320
first time screen's tough first time

i've looked at your screen with this new

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.320
lens of in my mind this new filter of

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.440
like is all the grime on his screen come

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.440
i don't know either it's got to be

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.960

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.280

thing coughs

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.520

convincing

girls when i was like listen i'm sorry

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.960

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.520
am complete like i'm agreeing that i was

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.440
wrong yeah i was like well

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.560
it's not that it's just you know

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.839
it's weird because they they would love

00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:08.720
to believe you're like super

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.920
one-dimensional and you're just walking

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.480
around being like asians black people

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.520
yeah

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.960
and it's like you're just making jokes

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.240
and then in your day-to-day life when

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.760
you know somebody's upset with you it

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.359
bothers you yeah because you're not a

00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:21.680
sociopath so now you gotta you know so

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.040
you just won't i do the same thing i

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.960
walk into a room and i'm like [ __ ] man

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.240

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.760
sure i've done it a couple times it

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.720
doesn't matter

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.319
and eventually it just comes back to me

00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:36.160
apologizing again yeah but there's a

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.599
whole other set of factors too because

00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:39.119
it's like

00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:41.599
i can't even explain like

00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:44.000
you having to apologize is almost like

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.920
bedrock to their social interaction you

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.599
know what i mean to like that whole

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:48.880
thing to where like

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.160
it's not like that that their whole

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.599
saturday nights revolve around that

00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:53.200
being like and then these asian girls

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.720
got mad and i for shane to do this and

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.720
it's like you run a [ __ ] comedy club

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.599
dude no it wasn't him no i know that but

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:01.040

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.640
to be like even be like yeah that was

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.720
[ __ ] up i've never met a comedy owner

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.079
who was like a club owner who was just

00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:08.000
trying to tell a comedian like well

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
they'll tell you not to be dirty i guess

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.440
you know what's also funny i haven't run

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.520
into that in a long time yeah it's been

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.760
like three years once you start middling

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.079

it's funny too when people like host

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:29.040
because now i have it in my mind that

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.960
the host should be kind of clean yeah

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.560

right before the show i was getting the

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.680
old [ __ ] inside white guy talk i was

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.680
like i saw star wars a little too much

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.040
diversity you know what i mean like i

well all right it's not the most

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.839
ridiculous thing in the world but it's

00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:10.000
just like it's a little heavy-handed

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.920
like i was watching it by myself just

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.040
sitting there

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.000
empty theater one in the afternoon

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.680

your loving life you think you got

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.880
tricked by a ginny dude i think a genie

might when i went back and spliced a

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.560
bunch of people into the film perhaps

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.079
but uh

00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:27.280
one of the

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.440
it's just like so they've

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.359
diversified the movie they've made it

00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:33.520
more diverse which is cool but they only

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.319
made the rebellion diverse

00:45:36.319 --> 00:45:38.640
so like they inserted more women some

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.079
black guys

00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:42.079
some purple-haired lady

00:45:42.079 --> 00:45:43.920
some [ __ ] purple hair lady got a lot

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.440
of backlash purple hair lady was

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.960
atrocious

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.880
really really bad but uh so the

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.040
rebellion in star wars now is like the

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.359
rebellion's diverse the empire all the

00:45:53.359 --> 00:45:55.520
all the bad guys stayed white darth

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.599
trump stayed white british dude really

00:45:57.599 --> 00:45:59.200
like we have them

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.520
we should destroy them

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.480
sir please can we kill these rebellions

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.160
and that's true the funniest part about

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.000
that movie is that like if you even live

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.319
in america you're on the death star

00:46:10.319 --> 00:46:12.880
yeah it's like welcome dude yeah you are

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.319
the empire you're all yeah exactly

00:46:14.319 --> 00:46:15.520
you're part of it like basically the

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:18.319
rebellion is the [ __ ] taliban yeah

00:46:18.319 --> 00:46:20.000
they're fighting sky robots they're

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.520
fighting [ __ ]

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.599
literally yeah that is the funniest

00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:25.520
thing to me people like it's like yeah

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.720
yeah that's cool dude do you like hate

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.640
this country and all but you're kind of

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:29.760
you're a storm trooper that's sitting

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.119
there like maybe we should be nicer to

00:46:31.119 --> 00:46:32.720
ewoks guys

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.880
like shut the [ __ ] up dude get in line

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.119
okay but that is funny they did that

00:46:37.119 --> 00:46:38.319
because that's like

00:46:38.319 --> 00:46:39.920
you know and it's

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.760
you can see how they'd make an effort to

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.200
do that but i could see what you're

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.720
saying if it's like there's a [ __ ]

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:47.280
attack like the the space battle scenes

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.119
it's all like chick pilots fighting

00:46:49.119 --> 00:46:51.280
against bad guys yeah i mean that's just

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.960
yeah and that's just gonna be red team

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.359
go and it's like oh god damn it

00:46:55.359 --> 00:46:56.960
yeah that's gonna be doing this that's

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.079
gonna be the way that's gonna be the way

00:46:58.079 --> 00:47:01.520
it is dude oh how about this what

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.160
call of duty world war ii game yeah

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.079
female fighters

00:47:06.079 --> 00:47:08.800
what they also won't show a swastika

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.319
even showing the germans they don't show

00:47:10.319 --> 00:47:12.720
swastikas no swastikas

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.560
nazi germany i can see but i can see

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.560
them taking that out just because of

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.160
like they have the [ __ ] holocaust in

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.319
it do they really yeah they have guys

00:47:20.319 --> 00:47:22.640
including people who love the holocaust

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.880
this is just like [ __ ] swm's

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.040
definitely it's just straight white yeah

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.480
i could be wrong here but i'm pretty

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.760
sure they have

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.280
black female

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.599
soldiers yeah world war two

00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:36.240
front lines yeah classic against the uh

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.079
very against so they have the nazis and

00:47:38.079 --> 00:47:40.160
like ghostbusters outfits basically yeah

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.960
it's just like brown that's funny really

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.440
i i can still i'm not sure i could see

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.040
them leaving out the swastika just

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.400
because it's like

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.760
they're like all right just don't draw a

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.359
big huge emblazone but i guess video

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:53.359
games have had that before right

00:47:53.359 --> 00:47:55.680
like world war ii games yeah i've had a

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.079
nice little schwa going down oh man

00:47:58.079 --> 00:48:00.400

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.880
yeah

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.480
wait so they have

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.920

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:11.040

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.760
that's [ __ ] sick

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.119
i guess

00:48:15.119 --> 00:48:16.560
what did you do when you were when you

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.760
were like your infantry man running

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.680
around you saw these [ __ ] women and

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.760
[ __ ] black female nazis

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.119
i don't know what you do

00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:24.640
what do you do if you're

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.400
fighting the nazis what do you do if

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.079
you're fighting the us

00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:30.880
the airborne yeah and there's black

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.200
black females airborning parachuting

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.200

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:42.240
we see in 1944 yeah 45 the us sent over

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.480
black women to finish the job

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.240
definitely dude according to

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.440
according to the ea game like hitler

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.040
put down the guns now

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:57.040
i don't like people playing with my jews

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.440
yeah that i mean that's definitely uh

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.599
but it's it's anymore it's like i mean

00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:02.960
it's a video game so it's hard for i'm

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.040
not like i'm not offended but of course

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.680
it's just it's so typical it is funny so

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.800
did you get it did you get a good

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.400
controller slam in as soon as you saw a

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.760
black lady you're like guys i didn't

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.280

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.800
trailer yeah yeah i've seen enough

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.520
there's enough backlash online

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.000
if i if i didn't know that and i started

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.440
playing it that would [ __ ] ruin that

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.119
game for me yeah because it would just

00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:25.280
be can i it happened during star wars i

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.880
was watching star wars and then they

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.440
just kept doing [ __ ] like

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.440
like the purple-haired lady comes out of

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.800
nowhere and it's like i'm the captain

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.400
now i have

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.400
like you're just a trigger-happy man can

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.800
a woman please control that and it's i'm

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.240
sitting there i'm like they say they go

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.680
like that deep into it yes and i'm

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.839
sitting there i'm like can i just why

00:49:43.839 --> 00:49:45.920
should i just not have this jam down my

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.559
[ __ ] throat damn for two seconds you

00:49:48.559 --> 00:49:51.280
can't i'm in a theater by myself in new

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.800
jersey just trying to watch a [ __ ]

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.240
movie i love that since i was a kid

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.160
i love star wars yeah and i sit down i'm

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.079
so happy the [ __ ]

00:50:00.079 --> 00:50:01.760
star wars comes on the screen it's like

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.680
[ __ ] yes it's gonna be awesome

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.160
and then like within a minute it's like

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.240
three strong asian ladies are blowing up

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.920
a [ __ ] thing and i'm just like god

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.160
what the [ __ ]

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.440
so you think all it should just be

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.520
straight white men not exclusively but

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.359
if it's going to be fighting

00:50:17.359 --> 00:50:18.559
yes

00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:20.079
not just white men there should be some

00:50:20.079 --> 00:50:22.319
black guys and some aliens yeah

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:24.720
get some aliens in there yeah hell yeah

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.960
but if it's fighting i don't you mean if

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.640
you're if you're gonna do this why are

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.720
we pretending that like well especially

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.559
the video game it's like

00:50:32.559 --> 00:50:34.160
so i mean if it's a world war ii game

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.839
and we're throwing in black ladies or

00:50:35.839 --> 00:50:36.960
any ladies it doesn't matter if they're

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.559
black it's just like

00:50:38.559 --> 00:50:42.400
the us now hardly uses females in combat

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.079
i've never if they do i don't know if

00:50:44.079 --> 00:50:45.040
they do

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.319
they've probably got a couple [ __ ]

00:50:46.319 --> 00:50:49.359
hell raisers but it's probably like

00:50:49.359 --> 00:50:51.040
but it's like i don't know if they're

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.559
kicking in why are we pretending that

00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:54.160
like now we're gonna just rewrite

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.760
history not rewrite history because it's

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.760
a [ __ ] video game but still yeah but

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.200
i mean but still be like and this is

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.520

because it's like i mean you know this

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.599
you could totally just be like whatever

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:10.960
but there is a part when you're playing

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.640
it and you're storming d-day and you're

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.319

elementary i don't think i would want

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.559
lucy liu leading the fight really

00:52:16.559 --> 00:52:17.920
although lucy liu is pretty good she's

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.119
killed ellie yeah yeah she's gonna

00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:20.400
[ __ ] handle the lightsaber that's

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.640
true yeah that's that's odd but it's

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.079
also like

00:52:24.079 --> 00:52:26.079
i just i wonder what's gonna happen

00:52:26.079 --> 00:52:27.359
like what are they gonna people gonna

00:52:27.359 --> 00:52:30.559
get like sick of it or is it just like

00:52:30.559 --> 00:52:31.920
i was saying that was today in my car i

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.280
was like we're just getting bullied and

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.160
i like

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.520
everything's just coming back into style

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.960
we're just now we have to be gentlemen

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.200
again like in the 40s you gotta be like

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.720
like not pull out our dicks now we're

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.119
back to being like madam yes yes but we

00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:44.800
can't we also in the double bind where

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:45.599
like

00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:47.200
we'd have to like

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.040
get to a door then look and like see if

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.400
you want us because if you open the door

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.599
you can also offend so you have to be

00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:52.960
like

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.480
we have to basically just be weaklings

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.920
here's some other ones i'm sorry to i'm

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.079
just thinking about this now it's like i

00:52:58.079 --> 00:52:59.680
was watching peaky blinders i just

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.359
watched i just watched the second love

00:53:01.359 --> 00:53:03.599
the show yeah the second episode awesome

00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:04.880
you should keep watching it yeah i like

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.520
it but they still toss in like the peaky

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.280
blinders within their gang yeah there's

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.720
there's a couple black guys sneaking

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.800
around you'll see that in the piggies

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:16.160
yeah and it's like dude this is 1920s

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.520
or 19 yeah 20s [ __ ] england and these

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.000
are gypsies from

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.839
england like how open-minded do you

00:53:23.839 --> 00:53:25.200
think these dudes are

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.359
i don't know and also

00:53:27.359 --> 00:53:28.559
and that's another thing because you can

00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:30.559
you can be like okay there's like

00:53:30.559 --> 00:53:32.240
there's jamaicans it's just caribbean of

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.400
course there's black people from

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.079
in in england it's in a city it's all

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:38.720
that so like yeah that could have been

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.800
there yeah

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.040
it's unlikely probably yeah but yes it

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.480
could same thing that happened in

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.880
[ __ ] battlefront that video game yeah

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.800
the american guys are black and

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.720
battlefront what in the battlefront it's

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.200
like a world war one game okay it's like

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.440
do they have black they did

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.880
yeah but that's like one

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:01.359
percent of the united states forces over

00:54:01.359 --> 00:54:02.559
there yeah it's like that's who we're

00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:03.680
going with

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.160
yeah all right all right all right i'm

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.410
not gonna get mad

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:08.720
[Laughter]

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.640
but i like my soldiers and my video

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.800
games white and i like my star wars

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.319
white

00:54:14.319 --> 00:54:16.079
that's sick dude

00:54:16.079 --> 00:54:17.359
it's it is funny i mean the piggy

00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:19.119
blinders one is like

00:54:19.119 --> 00:54:21.280
i i don't know anything about it

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.800
yeah like it's clear that they inserted

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.640
it there's a [ __ ] black priest that

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.720
the peaky blinders go to like they

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.559
needed they needed

00:54:28.559 --> 00:54:30.880
to insult you i can get that i can just

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.800
you know brush it off because yeah when

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.880
you know like in louis louis had

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.559
just super white kids and then his wife

00:54:36.559 --> 00:54:38.319
was just black and then you can watch

00:54:38.319 --> 00:54:39.839
the show and it's just like

00:54:39.839 --> 00:54:41.359
yeah it doesn't it doesn't affect me

00:54:41.359 --> 00:54:43.359
yeah but it's just when you can see it

00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:45.119
it's clear what they're doing yeah of

00:54:45.119 --> 00:54:46.640
course you know why they're doing it

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.559
that's for a modern purpose a current

00:54:48.559 --> 00:54:50.319
purpose yeah exactly they're making a

00:54:50.319 --> 00:54:52.720
historical piece

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.319
and then they're like here's some we got

00:54:54.319 --> 00:54:56.079
to make sure today people are happy

00:54:56.079 --> 00:54:57.440
about it yeah

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.559
and like

00:54:58.559 --> 00:55:00.000
well it's actually pretty smart if you

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.839
think about it it's or maybe it is

00:55:01.839 --> 00:55:03.599
because it's like

00:55:03.599 --> 00:55:05.119
you you just get nothing but praise and

00:55:05.119 --> 00:55:06.960
if anyone is like what the [ __ ] why'd

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.880
you why'd you like put a bunch of black

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.319
guys in this

00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:11.599
just like the problem just takes care of

00:55:11.599 --> 00:55:13.040
itself racist so you just get all the

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.800
praise and it's just like oh sure if

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.920
anybody's like

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.760
why the [ __ ] are there so many chicks in

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.760
star wars now like the rebellions and

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.240
see there's the problem i i don't have a

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.240
problem with chicks and star wars yeah

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.520
it's funny though that they only made

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.119
the good guys

00:55:27.119 --> 00:55:28.480

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.079
one chick

00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:33.599
one female storm just like an ann

00:55:33.599 --> 00:55:36.000
coulter yeah they have a white british

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.960
female uh stormtrooper

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.800
yeah i mean that's that's the uh you

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.319

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.240

this podcast you couldn't within less

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.920

before i went on yeah

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.760
i was backstage talking to the girl the

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.839
female comic who eventually would demand

00:59:41.839 --> 00:59:44.079
an apology out of me yeah before the

00:59:44.079 --> 00:59:45.200
show

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.400
you know being friendly everything's

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.920
good and i was like

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.400
she was like kind of asking

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.680
i was like i might have said like i

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.680
don't feel like going out there yeah i

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.880
don't want to do it and she's like why

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.559
what's wrong i was like i just i don't

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:58.160
like performing at a place where i i

00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.359
have a feeling

00:59:59.359 --> 01:00:00.880
like i just get the feeling that

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.559
everybody in here [ __ ] does not like

01:00:02.559 --> 01:00:04.559
me yeah like the comics i see the comics

01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:06.880
that hang out there the owner every like

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.720
just doesn't i know the owner doesn't

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.119
like me yeah and and just when you see

01:00:11.119 --> 01:00:13.200
other comics that are like wanting you

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.599
to fail of course so it's hard to do

01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:16.880
stand up for people that don't like you

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.480
yeah especially in a crowd that's geared

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.559
in a crowd that's like he better not be

01:00:20.559 --> 01:00:22.319
offensive he's a straight white man he's

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:24.799
lucky he's here yeah if he's not being

01:00:24.799 --> 01:00:26.079
silly

01:00:26.079 --> 01:00:28.319
he better not be straight and white yeah

01:00:28.319 --> 01:00:29.839
the only way you can be white on that

01:00:29.839 --> 01:00:31.359
type of stage is super simple you're

01:00:31.359 --> 01:00:33.440
like wearing a tight sweater and being a

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.040
complete [ __ ] yeah

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.480
and making foot like i suck my own dick

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.760
actually that's [ __ ] sorry that was a

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.280
bad example because it's a real example

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.440
um

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.599
and from a funny comment but uh

01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:46.799
just before the show i was like yeah i

01:00:46.799 --> 01:00:47.760
just i

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.119
i just i don't like performing places

01:00:49.119 --> 01:00:50.079
where i feel like people don't like me

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.200
and she was like yeah i feel that a lot

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:51.920
too

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.520
and i was like yeah it's once you

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.400
realize that no one gives a [ __ ]

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.079
yeah once you realize like you're not

01:00:58.079 --> 01:01:00.240
important enough for people to care yeah

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.480
which is normally the case

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.680
then it doesn't matter you realize

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.960
you're just being dumb you're in your

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.319
own head because no one gives a [ __ ]

01:01:06.319 --> 01:01:08.640
yeah and then uh i was like but usually

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.280
what happens is i'll go out there

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.559

being liberal yeah make fun of it for

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:17.520
being a safe space

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.160
and then always it does well it works

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.359
and then as soon as i get off stage i

01:01:21.359 --> 01:01:23.280
feel bad about it

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.799
just because what else can you do i feel

01:01:24.799 --> 01:01:26.559
bad about it and then

01:01:26.559 --> 01:01:28.160
