it's what the [ __ ] is that not the last

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.820
it was a Shogun the book mmm Last

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.470
Samurai was based off that they talk

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:14.849
about the willow world and how like

00:18:14.849 --> 00:18:16.769
these like they'll uh in Japan they

00:18:16.769 --> 00:18:18.539
would like raised from the time their

00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:19.739
children to be basically like

00:18:19.739 --> 00:18:21.809
prostitution sweet boys sweet boys sweet

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:25.889
girls oh they give the sweet baby so

00:18:25.889 --> 00:18:27.389
then the will of the lady he was like

00:18:27.389 --> 00:18:29.429
the the headmistress whatever would

00:18:29.429 --> 00:18:30.899
always talk about the willow world and

00:18:30.899 --> 00:18:32.129
like that was like something some people

00:18:32.129 --> 00:18:34.440
were just like sent into to live in and

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.999
it was like in the willow world like all

00:18:35.999 --> 00:18:37.679
these rules don't apply like if you want

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:39.779
a little sweet boy like basically

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:40.859
telling the girl I remember at one point

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:42.389
she was training her she was like they

00:18:42.389 --> 00:18:43.859
might request a little bullet might

00:18:43.859 --> 00:18:46.109
request like a boy and they're like this

00:18:46.109 --> 00:18:47.460
is the willow world none of the real

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.379
rules apply it's totally natural and

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:50.429
they'll go out and like go do their

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:51.779
government post what do you think of it

00:18:51.779 --> 00:18:53.279
it's the willow world that's probably

00:18:53.279 --> 00:18:54.359
where my brother got all that in from

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:56.099
that [ __ ] wisdom about it's very boy

00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:57.929
yeah he was like it's the willow world

00:18:57.929 --> 00:18:59.359
dude it's like doesn't apply

00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:01.169
unfortunately now it's broken down to

00:19:01.169 --> 00:19:02.840
like human sex trafficking

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.830
well trumps didn't even get off the

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.679
plane dude he just hung out when when he

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:08.759
went with the Clintons to the willow

00:19:08.759 --> 00:19:10.830
world on that plan the Epstein's island

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.019
epstein that was the world Trump just

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:14.340
hung out with the staff and the kosher

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.109

Russian says he only [ __ ] he'll eat

00:19:19.349 --> 00:19:20.940
Eastern Bloc snooze

plane yeah he's my boy kite in the menu

00:19:27.389 --> 00:19:30.029
definitely he's probably like what he's

00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:33.059
a fan of big mature naturals Trump loves

00:19:33.059 --> 00:19:35.759
signature nothing he's like wait a

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:38.070
second yeah true his wasn't an ethical

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.899
stance it was purely like a what they

00:19:39.899 --> 00:19:41.460

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:42.899
flavor

dude in that documentary about her

00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:46.499
there's a documentary of him on Netflix

00:19:46.499 --> 00:19:49.799
that like Trump I think it was on a AMC

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:51.599
first yeah I forget there's a

00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:52.960
documentary on Trump

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.330
there was a time where he was like

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.920
calling this newspaper talking about how

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.520
much snez he got as a secretary he was

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.740
like I work for mr. Trump he gets so

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.130
much [ __ ] but that that Trump was

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.080
calling like the New York Post are the

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.850
times like let it be known and being

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.360
like hey just you know I mean it's a ton

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.490
of [ __ ] probably [ __ ] his secretary

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.380
relayed that he pretended to be a

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.540
secretary literally you could tell it

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.640

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.350

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.670
[ __ ] [ __ ] yeah I mean he was bogged

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.820

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.570
part is I could literally imagine his

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.070

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.520
those faces where you can exactly

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.840
imagine his CEA's come face the same one

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.270
I want to see when he gets shot when he

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.890
drops it when he's at a podium talking

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.510

00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:49.909
now just not it like two Cowboys at each

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:51.290

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:53.510

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.460
Westworld yeah dude if I ever [ __ ]

00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:00.110
sick yeah dude the [ __ ] oh don't you

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.780
tell me the Internet the have you ever

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.150
[ __ ] with you know a blockchain is no

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.220
I heard about it 100 times I never

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.540
really knew what it was and I still

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.550
don't know if I understand it but I was

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.750
I'm still reading this one book about

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:15.560
how the guy wants to take the internet

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.840
and make it so that everyone who uses it

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.520
gets paid for whatever they contribute

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.470
to the internet if that's used for

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:22.910
something else that is that

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:24.799
profitable okay so like art like

00:35:24.799 --> 00:35:26.950
artificial intelligence with like

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.910
translation services or whatever

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.319
whatever kind of thing that's based off

00:35:30.319 --> 00:35:32.390
of people who generate that data for

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.309
those piranhas like just think of it

00:35:34.309 --> 00:35:35.299
like your artificial intelligence

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:37.520
doesn't just be like oh I realized they

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.589
just they take huge amounts of data so

00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:41.390
this guy saying like basically how to do

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.549
that and I forget how do you described

00:35:43.549 --> 00:35:48.200
it but it's like hTML is like one way in

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.549
the tin the way it connects and that

00:35:49.549 --> 00:35:51.049
gute what Google did was make it to way

00:35:51.049 --> 00:35:52.250
we're like hyperlink to everything

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:54.349
together but this would be so basically

00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:56.210
he was saying like stores are and the

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.710
internet or like a tree model or it's

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.960
like like eBay it's like you know it

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.700
facilitates all these sales people do

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.260
with each other but eBay is the root of

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.049
it and the I think it fit [ __ ] route

00:36:06.049 --> 00:36:07.670
it's a thick [ __ ] roots you can't do

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:08.990
it you can do anything you want on there

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:10.849
but every all roads lead here same with

00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:13.190
Amazon all the roads lead here this was

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.039
more like this would be like completely

00:36:16.039 --> 00:36:17.720
eliminate that to where like there's no

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.520
stores or anything there's just the the

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.859
web all one big marketplace and you just

00:36:21.859 --> 00:36:23.630
sell your wares buy [ __ ] and that's it

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.069
and then anything you're typing any

00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:26.750
content that's getting used you're

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.579
getting paid for that all the time so

00:36:28.579 --> 00:36:32.210
like say like you do a an article it's

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:34.250
learned the thing in the book he start

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:35.299
basically books to would become

00:36:35.299 --> 00:36:36.289
completely obsolete because the

00:36:36.289 --> 00:36:37.609
information was I mean don't get me

00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:39.230
started how papers a prison dude I mean

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.210
you know I'm an audiobook guy but

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:42.680
basically they're saying like paper

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.029
everything is just completely obsolete

00:36:44.029 --> 00:36:45.799
alright you just you're just flowing

00:36:45.799 --> 00:36:48.410
information and it's [ __ ] sick but he

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:49.640
was saying that it would be like if

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.250
you're on the beach and you like figured

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:53.710
out how to do some sort of long

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:55.849
sandcastle thing like how to make like a

00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:58.130
sand bridge in a sand castle and then

00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:59.539
like people see that information and

00:36:59.539 --> 00:37:02.359
then like some guy you know does some

00:37:02.359 --> 00:37:03.980
think of errs and puts it on the new

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.869
whatever then you're they're just like

00:37:05.869 --> 00:37:07.130
boom boom they send you a bunch of money

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.839
one day like oh [ __ ] yeah sweet and that

00:37:08.839 --> 00:37:10.339
would be happening like constantly Wow

00:37:10.339 --> 00:37:11.930
where you're like if like when you go

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.480
viral at all you would just get paid it

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.829
once it'll be happening to people so

00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:17.210
much that how much [ __ ] bread the

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:18.349
Iceman would have right now he'd be

[ __ ] clocking Soviet and he's like

00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:21.559
that's the only way we'll be able to get

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:22.730
through this otherwise it's just gonna

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.740
be the big servers just collect all the

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.240
data and just don't give anyone more

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.619
yeah he's like and we're gonna be [ __ ]

00:37:27.619 --> 00:37:28.940
with automation he's like we're like

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.089

that'll be kind of disastrous is that

00:49:36.189 --> 00:49:38.079

air right now that's sort of progressive

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:47.709

a show on FX had me like aghast I was

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:01.300
just like there's gay dudes kisses it

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.760
was like seduce old men and murder them

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.990

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.900
old powerful men and then leave and get

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.790

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:14.530
apartment kill him you get a lemon party

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:16.210
going and then after you kill him he'd

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:17.950
have basically have them coming out of

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:20.410
the closet as they were murdered this

00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:23.200
guy was a [ __ ] psycho dude and he

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.970
went and killed Gianni Versace that was

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:27.310
his final [ __ ] final Jionni wouldn't

give him today he wouldn't give I don't

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.320
think he does even give a phone call

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.760
afterwards or was something happen where

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.930
he was like I'm gonna kill this

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:37.300
[ __ ] yeah but he had like a

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.130
trail of gay destruction on the way dude

00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:42.340
it was so fun it was so funny yeah

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.230
there's another that's a way to go out

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:46.780
on top though if you're like goal is to

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:47.920
kill old gay dudes

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.240
he was just to be famous like you know

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.340
I'll get Versace that was a solid

00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:54.820
[ __ ] snag but he was uh yeah he was

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.520
like in the show he's like a big liar

00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:59.650
like he just like lies like so his dad

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:01.870
was like a Filipino dude who was like a

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:04.540
pyramid scheme er and uh he like got

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.740
like kicked out here like flee the

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:06.940
United States cuz you ask a man old

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.980
people out of money so the dad left and

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.060
went to the Philippines and was just

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:11.560
like I'm a very powerful but I think he

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.700
was molested Philippines

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:14.770
he was the dad's from Philippine or the

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:17.410
Dow that is that was a Filipino dude who

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:18.020
came here

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:19.820
and was trying to get his lake nigerian

00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:23.000
prince on and he got busted okay so he

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.290
was trying to do something he went back

00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:25.790
to the willow world so they said in fact

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:28.310
he escaped back to the willow world and

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:30.320

especially micro birds like real tough

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.580
like when you're talking like maybe

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.410

01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:08.750
able to thicken your team something dude

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.000

sure you got thick hog you're chilling

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.560
although I wonder about that sometimes I

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.470
think there's a whole like elite

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:47.900
underground Society of just hogs dude

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:50.300
really yeah dudes with thick fur it's

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:51.740
got a power you at some point when

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.600
you're like if you're really ultimate

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.460
hog you'd think you'd be like I'm

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.720
destined for great things but I think

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.010
sometimes it has the opposite effect

01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:59.920
where you're like I've just chill

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.760
everything I need is right here

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.500
true I think if you have a tennis you're

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.390
ready to [ __ ] rage I feel like if you

01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:06.800
had a hog and you saw like a lot of

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.060
people with Tina's bossing you around

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:08.660
you

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:11.150
god [ __ ] yes they buck the system and

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:12.440
they get fired unless you're Trump dog

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.289
true Tom dog has a hog and because you

01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:18.109

01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:20.539
a hog tip there's no one's really got in

01:04:20.539 --> 01:04:22.220
on his [ __ ] fold his shaft the shaft

is to be determined his he's a Fathead

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.690
I mean if you have a Fathead do you have

01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:29.030
a decent dong true if you have a thick

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:31.880
head that's a good dollar true it counts

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.859
you can't have a teenager in for a

01:04:33.859 --> 01:04:35.660

fight again usually am I don't you see

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:51.250

fighting is there was a fight of 50

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:55.449
people just statistically like 70% in

01:12:55.449 --> 01:12:56.590
the panov they're not gonna really fight

01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:58.570

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.070
so these cops are getting in there

01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:07.270
breaking up his fight and he ends up

01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:09.160

you know the credits yeah and then this

01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:19.280
is up so I was like I'm hit the bathroom

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.500
before the other thing comes up dude I

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.540
walked out and I was like I am [ __ ] I am

01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:26.660
high as [ __ ] it was really sometimes you

01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:29.120
get so high you don't like you feel

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.219
almost silver I don't know if you ever

01:27:31.219 --> 01:27:32.600
done that before but yeah it's like you

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.340
I used to smoke myself sober all the

01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:35.929
time where you just get so high you hit

01:27:35.929 --> 01:27:37.940
a point where you're like I'm sober now

01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:40.400
it's weird but like I was like I was in

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.500
the running to the bathroom and I was

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.690
just like what the fine there's for some

01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:47.090
reason in this bathroom it's the AMC on

01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:49.219
Broad Street near temple there's no

01:27:49.219 --> 01:27:50.810
mirror in the bathroom you just wash

01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:52.070
your hands in a sink and there's just a

01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:54.860
tile wall so like I'd like walked right

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.300
past that I'm like sitting there pissing

01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.160
in the urinal you don't get really high

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.020
and all of a sudden you're like this is

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.330
wrong like something's wrong this all

01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:04.910
wrong every [ __ ] time I didn't I so

01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:05.929
this is so I'm sitting there I'm

01:28:05.929 --> 01:28:07.429
starting to go down rabbit hole and like

01:28:07.429 --> 01:28:08.630
I thought it wasn't hi I'm actually high

01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:12.350
as [ __ ] right the ho oh my no dude it

01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:13.880
was the day Saturday of the second show

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:16.880
so I'm like Danny got high that day and

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.760
afternoon I was so [ __ ] high and I'm

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:20.960
in the bathroom and I'm sitting there

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.400
and I didn't think I was in the thing

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.650
gonna be like that it's almost like what

01:28:24.650 --> 01:28:27.290
the [ __ ] dude literal red pill blue pill

01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:29.150
moment I'm in there and I was just my

01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:30.679
little Tina's I'm holding on pee and I

01:28:30.679 --> 01:28:31.780
was just like

01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:34.690
no not [ __ ] doing this and I do just

01:28:34.690 --> 01:28:36.250
completely reversed it and was just like

01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:38.500
not gonna be a [ __ ] [ __ ] about this

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.539
at all and ice turned it off they did

01:28:40.539 --> 01:28:41.349
what it's crazy

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:43.510
that's great explain it and I'm that's

01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:45.070
been why that's what I try to work on

01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.550
lately

01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:48.429
that's a nice walk and you're high and

01:28:48.429 --> 01:28:49.630
you write you get yourself where you're

01:28:49.630 --> 01:28:51.250
like this is wrong

01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:53.889
I'm everything's wrong and like dude I

01:28:53.889 --> 01:28:55.300
was walking by the the fact that there

01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:57.130
wasn't a mirror that bothered me I was

01:28:57.130 --> 01:28:58.719
like there's not a [ __ ] mirror this

01:28:58.719 --> 01:29:00.280
is [ __ ] weird everything's weird as

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:02.139
[ __ ] right now dude but I had fully this

01:29:02.139 --> 01:29:04.300
been like nah dude that shit's [ __ ]

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:06.309
I'm not doing that and just completely

01:29:06.309 --> 01:29:08.739
champed it it was riding like if I was

01:29:08.739 --> 01:29:11.320
riding like a full just man wave I was

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.119
like I'm a [ __ ] man dude this [ __ ]

01:29:13.119 --> 01:29:14.980
doesn't bother me dude it was so tight

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:16.630
you know walking around in my champions

01:29:16.630 --> 01:29:18.699
if I'm like I'm a [ __ ] champion

01:29:18.699 --> 01:29:21.039
little bit of weed as I see off dude it

01:29:21.039 --> 01:29:23.440
was [ __ ] telling you that's there's a

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.900
there's a thing to be had by doing that

01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:28.599
and it's like it's not like a one time

01:29:28.599 --> 01:29:31.449
like change like I totally changed my

01:29:31.449 --> 01:29:32.829
whole personality it says you can get

01:29:32.829 --> 01:29:34.360
into the space where you grab the ship

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.369
and you just go and you just pull it the

01:29:36.369 --> 01:29:37.719
thing a little bit you can tweak it

01:29:37.719 --> 01:29:39.429
there's a tiny little bit then it all

01:29:39.429 --> 01:29:41.170
wears off and you're just like oh my

01:29:41.170 --> 01:29:45.130
usual [ __ ] [ __ ] as I'm telling you

01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:46.389
get in there enough that you can tweak

01:29:46.389 --> 01:29:49.329
it I'm talking risk it you have to get

01:29:49.329 --> 01:29:51.309
risk right now as waves you have to ride

01:29:51.309 --> 01:29:52.989
the wave can't crash into those waves

01:29:52.989 --> 01:29:55.570
dude I've tried every single time I get

01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:57.309
high well what was weird was like when I

01:29:57.309 --> 01:29:58.030
was like 19

01:29:58.030 --> 01:30:01.360
I saw no mirrors I would go into a I'd

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.280
freak out okay purple back you have

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.420
mirrors here because people keep

01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:05.590
breaking them this is a shitty

01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:07.090
neighborhood in this is a bad place and

01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:10.449
I'm in a bad place and yeah and what

01:30:10.449 --> 01:30:12.039
kind of [ __ ] break a mirror and then

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:13.750
I go it like you just I've been flipping

01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:15.159
it to where it's like instead of being

01:30:15.159 --> 01:30:17.020
like I'm so [ __ ] up I'm like no I'm

01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:18.880
enhanced right now and I just like do

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:21.070
turn it's like your whole body responds

01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:22.510
totally different based off like that

01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:24.369
little different tweak of thought it's

01:30:24.369 --> 01:30:26.889
crazy that it is five degrees maybe I'll

01:30:26.889 --> 01:30:28.449
get super [ __ ] high this week you

01:30:28.449 --> 01:30:31.090
have to do it dude do you think yeah you

01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:32.739
think that's a good choice yes you have

01:30:32.739 --> 01:30:34.119
to do it you have to you have to just

01:30:34.119 --> 01:30:35.590
completely rely on yourself and just

01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:37.719
battle it to can rely on this you can do

01:30:37.719 --> 01:30:39.190
that's what I used to think I used to be

01:30:39.190 --> 01:30:40.780
able to like gobble mushrooms and all

01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:42.789
this kind of stuff and it was like no

01:30:42.789 --> 01:30:43.960
problem and then when I was like

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.700
23 I started getting real bad anxiety

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:47.290
and it took me back to ground zero or

01:30:47.290 --> 01:30:48.640
like I'd smoke a little bit of weed and

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.739
bug out and I've been fighting a fight

01:30:50.739 --> 01:30:53.080
dude for years now I'm I'm getting him

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.700
back up there I'm like yes like that's a

01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:56.770
very I mean most shamans think that way

01:30:56.770 --> 01:30:58.600
yeah you got to enter the darkness and

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:00.310
fight your way dude I'm telling you I

01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:01.719
avoid it but you've been that's my

01:31:01.719 --> 01:31:03.100
that's why I like microdose a lot of

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:04.090
people like those shoots for [ __ ]

01:31:04.090 --> 01:31:05.800
[ __ ] it's like alright alright if you

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:07.750
can just gobble [ __ ] tabs of acid

01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:10.540

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:12.190

01:31:12.190 --> 01:31:14.500
a mushrooms dude you know get through

01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.630
that weird little like this is wrong I

01:31:16.630 --> 01:31:19.030

01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:21.040
