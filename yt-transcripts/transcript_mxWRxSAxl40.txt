for my segment

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.040

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.640
doug if you did listen to your own

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.719

stanhope rag which plays at the end

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.680

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.239
doug stanley podcast but he's not henry

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.239

you say i don't listen to my podcast i

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.000
do my podcast and when i say i forget

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.239
what i said maybe do you ever think i'm

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.399
being diplomatic in that

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.879
i've listened to my podcast and i hate

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.600
it and i want to keep you afloat you

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.880
ever think that this is all for you

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.159
ugh

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.119
you never think god these ingrates

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.799
that is a question that comes up by the

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:13.520
way

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.200
you were telling everybody if i moved it

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.280
just divided the group immediately but

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.000
no you told me over pizza that you hate

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.320
your own [ __ ] partner on your podcast

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.439
and you

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.159
have craigslist ads trying to replace

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.799
them no everyone's more qualified no one

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.799
can replace matt mccosker

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.200
that's what uh they say when they listen

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200
to your podcast like that's their

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.200
diplomatic way of saying i don't want to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.119
be part of yours no matter how much you

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.720
pay

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.640
all right this is why we did this

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.840
we're sitting here

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.640
all right

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.399
exactly how i thought it would go this

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.640
is exactly what it gets mean at night

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.399
yeah it's like

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.000
first podcast

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.479
night or do you mean the next day

tell boss is if you ask vos

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:53.360
not that you know it sucks to do any

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.600
type of listing at all and i don't want

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.720
to make this gay but if you're like boss

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.920

rich voss is one of those guys there's

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.240
there's a couple circles of comedy at my

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.720
age and then there's the new york guys

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.199
the [ __ ] tough crowd yeah yeah yeah

00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:22.399
alum

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.959
and then there's the uh the alt guys

00:16:24.959 --> 00:16:26.800
which is patton and

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.399
sarah and yeah yeah ridgevoss is a guy i

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:32.160
believe actually

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.560
likes me yeah yeah which is really

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.560
dependent on how much i like a person is

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.720
how much i believe they like me he likes

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.040
you a lot and it changes by the minute

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.000
but like like norton i like that's yeah

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.519
i think norton and i are really good

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:50.079
all people it's all people are like

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:51.839
they're they're they're like more like

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:53.680
cats

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.279
like uh

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:59.279
this is this is such a perfect like 80s

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.880
premise of

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.360
when it all started because too many

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.559
[ __ ] evening at the improv comics did

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:08.959
the difference between la and new york

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:11.679
and cats and dogs now it's

00:17:11.679 --> 00:17:13.600
all comics

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.520
they hated road comics that would do

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.520
[ __ ] hacked premises like that now

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.360
you're a hack premise yeah now believe

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.160
it or not

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.919
versus all comics are typically pretty

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:24.799
act now it's all like meta

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:26.799
it's all like stand up is stupid so i'm

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:28.559
not even gonna i don't [ __ ] die that

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:30.320
means you're you're doing stand up and

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.080
making fun of doing stand-up while

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.559
you're doing it it's it's uh

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:36.160
it sucks thank you

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.480
it's it's like they said

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.600
obscenity trials like

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.400
what is obscenity and the judge says i

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.080
can't describe it but i know it when i

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.240
see it i know meta when i see it but i

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.320
can't tell you what it means yeah and

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.760
it's uh

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.760
i don't know and they all got very very

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.880
political

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.160
i don't know if they always were because

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.840
i wasn't that old

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.919

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.120
and from a male point of view

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.240

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.720
female dating whatever

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.960
hired by snl and two days later fired

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.480
when they found

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.880
some old podcast where he made some

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.240
[ __ ] chinese uh stereotypical voice

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.720
sound yeah and that's you can google it

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.039
from there but i will say this in their

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:55.919
defense the people who fired me that was

00:19:55.919 --> 00:19:57.760
the least offensive thing they could

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.200
have got me on

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.039

trying to write new [ __ ] for this and

00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:36.480
you get to an age where you go

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.559
today i was thinking of a bit that i

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:40.320

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.440

00:25:50.159 --> 00:25:52.559
when chile said something about we're

00:25:52.559 --> 00:25:54.320

00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:01.279
that will give you a day you don't have

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:03.679
to [ __ ] get drunk on another podcast

00:26:03.679 --> 00:26:04.640

because you're going to come here and

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.159
we're going to go on this [ __ ] epic

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:16.240

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.960
deadline for the final draft for monday

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.679

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.279
can for tomorrow i look forward to it

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:31.200
every day because it makes me stop

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.120
drinking when we're done at the podcast

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.640
so i can edit

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.200
and then have to [ __ ] do other things

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.960
in the morning like i have a life

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.080
somewhere

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.360
downstairs

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.960
let me fill shane in first of all chile

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.000
works all the time he's awake

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.480
if he's watching a movie it's while he's

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.799
editing and then juggling that's

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:54.880
embarrassing that how right he is right

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.559
there no that's what he's doing that

00:26:56.559 --> 00:26:58.720
last night chilly that's not a bad

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.400
quality well

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.120
yeah

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.400
i don't think he's i don't think he's

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.480
ripping me but no i'm saying it's a good

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.840
it's better than

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.440
mine

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.679
which is literally never

00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:11.919
but what did did you flinch at all when

00:27:11.919 --> 00:27:13.679
chaylee said that because when chili

00:27:13.679 --> 00:27:15.760
says well then i have to stop drinking

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.240
to work once i start

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.360
we're going

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.520
i don't stop drinking

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.919
i go to bed at four in the morning last

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:27.360
night at editing the uh james podcast

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.240
i started drinking tea

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.399
but i was drinking until like four in

00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:33.520
the morning

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.880
and then i didn't get done till seven

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.880
good it's a good night i've come to the

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.880
right place i was laughing so [ __ ]

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.000
hard

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
you guys both need to hear that podcast

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.960
yeah

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.320
we'll we'll

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.320
listen to the same part three times and

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.159
i walked out the door and i called tracy

00:27:50.159 --> 00:27:52.559
i go i had to get up

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:53.840
to get away

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.279
from hearing what i've heard already

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:56.799
three times because i'm laughing too

00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:59.039
hard okay i'm i'm gonna leave it at this

00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:01.039
because i thought this morning when i

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:04.320
woke up oh that james inman podcast that

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.080
we put out that i felt a little bit

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.320
guilty for i always feel a little bit

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.000
guilty

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.240
but

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.520
i thought [ __ ] it's already gone out

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.200
i wish we had uh an intro for that to

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.080
kind of indemnify ourselves me too

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.440
and then when chile found out something

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.640
else i went oh now it really needs at

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.679
least we're gonna have to readdress

00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:33.440
well i already leaked it on issues with

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.679
andy because i felt a little remorse and

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:38.240
chad had actually listened to the entire

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.360
thing

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.240
because he was going there to get his uh

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.720
his daughter out of prison

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.360
and they said that they they said jesus

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.960
christ they said i'm sorry to cut you

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.720
off i was driving down this guy was like

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.320
i gotta get my daughter out of prison

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.880
i'm driving down like jesus christ like

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.320
a gentleman

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.240
he goes down there and it's not his real

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.159
daughter we found out during the podcast

00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:02.480
he did a 23. but he still did a solid

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.640
but he yeah he's like they they release

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.000
it

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.480
they release at 4 30 and they release

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.679
everyone

00:29:09.679 --> 00:29:12.320
at the same time like men and women so

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.720
he went down there like a gentleman at 4

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.320
00 a.m

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.120
rented a hotel got out went at 4am and

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.960
then still had to do a podcast later

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.679
that day in which he told me

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:24.559
yeah

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:27.200
at 7 30 i finally called and they said

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.240
well no

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.600
like maybe 4 30 but it's within the

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:36.720
first 24 hours after 4 30. oh god

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.360
so he he listened to the whole podcast

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.039
and i go how crazy was it that he

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:42.640
couldn't get in camera if he goes wait

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.320
this video

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.640
he listened to the whole thing as it's

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.240
equally as good

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.279
listening oh but no it's got that's when

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:54.720
i told bingo oh yeah watch this one

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.679
uh

00:29:55.679 --> 00:29:58.000
she doesn't know how and i know she goes

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.799
well i'm not on the sign up thing

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.720
beating patreon

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.320
how does that work i go well i don't

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.120
know

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.120
yeah

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:09.200
me

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.159
yeah but uh yeah so uh

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:14.559
the one thing that i did tip was that uh

00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:17.679
i i when i set reset everything for

00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:19.600
issues with andy this morning

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.880
um yeah i realized zinman wasn't wrong

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.440
well that's what he wasn't right either

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.640
you you're gonna hear it tomorrow all

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.360
right

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.200
but it is one of those things we're like

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.000
oh you know what had you not like

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.720
cut us off of skype to begin with yeah

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.399
then maybe this would have turned out

00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:38.399
differently yeah but he was kind of

00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:40.320
right and we're we'll give him a

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.480
reprieve i i am the first one to say

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.440

my own podcasts that i can remember

00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:03.919

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.760

my phone i told you but phone was

00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:49.519
blowing up with [ __ ] just twitter

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:52.159
notifications of james inman because i

00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:53.519
follow him i should have blocked him

00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:56.159
again just to wire him some more but uh

00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:58.480
i felt really bad like at about about

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.880
when i stopped drinking that uh i should

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.039
let him know like hey and i did text him

00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:05.200
i go hey i rerouted everything and i

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.120
think i've figured out what's going on

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.279
but honestly i didn't but chili you and

00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:10.960
i were [ __ ]

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.200
we went into this

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.840
james inman podcast because that's

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.080
when he's at his best like we said windy

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.559
city heat you you were prepared

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:22.399
doug was peeing over the fence and he

00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:25.200
goes shaylee how do we do this i go

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.279
i don't know and he goes well

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.480
no i said

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.000
i like i've

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.080
it's afternoon i'm hungover he didn't

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.760
know what the anger said i don't know

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.240
what we can fire him up about anymore

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.159
because he always has something

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:41.760
and i go it'll probably come naturally

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.279
and it did like

00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:46.320
the whole skype thing being [ __ ] up

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.880
and then chile and i without words were

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.440
[ __ ] tap dancing with our eyes oh

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.360
this is we got a [ __ ] angle we got

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.399
him we got [ __ ] invented

00:32:56.399 --> 00:32:58.399
you know the beauty of the of the video

00:32:58.399 --> 00:33:01.360
on patreon uh patreon.com

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.360
podcast uh

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.519
like the the the the communication

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:09.519
yeah because we'll do a split screen and

00:33:09.519 --> 00:33:12.080
you'll see me and you and and you and

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.679
then all of a sudden i say something or

00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:15.279
you say something and the other person's

00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:18.559
eyes light up like that that's good

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:20.240
we didn't say anything we walked into it

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.840
like we don't know

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.320
it's the best it was two on one which is

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.320
unfair but it was just it was a sweet

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.039
sign

00:33:27.039 --> 00:33:29.200
it was the sweet science you felt it

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.080
queensberry rules finally won

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.960
this this is the deal though is that

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.640
it all started with him 10 minutes

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.399
before he went on the air to where we

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:42.720
could do a test him saying i'm done with

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.600
skype i'm not i [ __ ] couldn't handle

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.399
it i stopped it so call me

00:33:48.399 --> 00:33:50.799
so then all of a sudden okay game on so

00:33:50.799 --> 00:33:52.480
then i said let's get your doug let's

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.320
get your phone locked into the board

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.799
let's do all so everything was geared

00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:59.919
towards the phone at that point but he

00:33:59.919 --> 00:34:02.080
chose the match

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.760
he's i he said he is

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.200
he's a beautiful beautiful [ __ ]

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.200
crash landing

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.599
well and neither of you would give him

00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:22.079
your own number for him to call it

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:23.520
exactly no

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.520
who would then i'm going well just call

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.040
me on my phone because

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.800
my old phone number i won't give him my

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.520
new phone number

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.520
then this audio doesn't work

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.560
it's watching spazz oh it's great

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.879
this this is the this is the thing is

00:34:40.879 --> 00:34:41.599
that

00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:44.639
we were connected with audio and video

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.240
it's just we were using two different

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.760
mediums

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.320
to to do the podcast and he couldn't

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.480
handle that and then that was the thing

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.079
it's like well why don't we just do this

00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:56.639
this is not right it's like this is not

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.440
right for an hour and 20 minutes i was

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.040

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.800
wrestling federation

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.880
knowledge that the height

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.280
the build up yeah but then he turns

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.560
right into self-involved immediately and

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.720
he doesn't understand that

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.359

james why can't i be the hero

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.839

to go first so why don't you you're in a

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.960
chair that doesn't spin because it it

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.480
holds your girth

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.079
so you're gonna have to

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:16.160
turn it towards chili while i piss

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.320

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.280
break we take a break we could take a

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.079
break but if i kill the momentum you

00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:27.599
could have some one-on-one time with

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:30.400
those [ __ ] baby blues and maybe we

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.880

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.320

something funny about uh

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.880
white women that were fat back then

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.400
being like hot

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.000
yeah funny to think like

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
white dudes back in the day or wealthy

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.880
had the same taste as black dudes today

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.720
like shakespeare back then was like damn

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.359
that's a thick [ __ ] like

00:39:49.359 --> 00:39:51.920
the 16th century yeah

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.800
no there were no black people back then

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.240
true they were invented by the clinton

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.599
foundation hello othello totally

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:01.520
and they had a play

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.839
and they had a plague back then

00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:04.960

00:42:41.119 --> 00:42:42.720
anyone and nothing yeah you were just

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.400
like oh i am the undertaker

now there are some wrestlers that are

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.240

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.800
those vice like beyond the ring things

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.160
you know you have you watched any of

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.800
those be on the map

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.640
they're so good i just watched the new

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.319
jack one

00:43:02.319 --> 00:43:05.040
new jack was this black dude from ecw

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:05.920
that like

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.680
stabbed the guy and like

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.520
tased a dude and threw them all like he

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.359
was like committing crimes in the ring

00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:13.440
like he got arrested for like

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.040
he stabbed the guy

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.640
and uh

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.480
but he they were like he he thought he

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.800
was real mm-hmm like new jack was he

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.880
believed his own hype yeah that's that's

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.119
netflix that's alex jones no it's on

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:27.040
yeah it's not yeah it's advice right now

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.000
all right

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.079
it just came back right but so why would

00:43:30.079 --> 00:43:32.720
alex jones be the one you would go on no

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.200
oh just because it'd be funny yeah yeah

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.800
it would be funny different than this no

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.640
i'm not like serious

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.280
well all right but you wouldn't be like

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.760
doing alex jones would not commit you to

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.319
a left right like oh okay no what i was

00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:48.800
saying is they still think he's no

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.800
there's definitely people like uh

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.480
there's just like it's just political so

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.800
the the cancel culture is a political

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.680
thing

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.680
so what does that mean what does cancel

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.880
culture mean cancel culture is like uh i

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.560
don't know look at it [ __ ] like i can

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.240
show you pictures black [ __ ] it's like

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.040
black [ __ ] perfect okay got it it's a

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.839
perfect uh analogy for him because no

00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:11.359
one knows them but

00:44:11.359 --> 00:44:13.440
if people will go out and protest a

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.680
small venue

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.839
it becomes a thing yeah yeah cancel

00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:19.839
culture is like so you can protest

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:21.440
through social media they don't have to

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.839
actually put [ __ ] boots on the ground

00:44:23.839 --> 00:44:25.680
and show up in the cold with the picket

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.160

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.160
i hosted one and it was for [ __ ] like

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.800
a year and a half every late night 15

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.040
seconds on basic cable my commercial you

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.280
sold mostly as a goofy like you were

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.680
gonna go i gotta be honest with you that

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.160
[ __ ] rules dude no it was awful i'm

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.560
sure as an adult you were because i was

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.200
a young boy when those commercials that

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.599
i jerked off to the commercials but

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:48.560
not but

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.640
i was the one i probably jerked off to

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.720
you actually this is where you

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.599
were

00:45:53.599 --> 00:45:56.960
jerking off hey bart simpson do the line

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.800
i definitely was jerking off when you

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.960
came

00:46:07.359 --> 00:46:09.839
just yelling at those teenage girls but

00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:11.839
when he got after that like

00:46:11.839 --> 00:46:14.640
immediately i i

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.599
think in my own opinion without any

00:46:17.599 --> 00:46:20.240
factual evidence that he's a [ __ ]

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.640
rapist and that's the one guy i'm like

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.200
how did he not get me too because

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.599
probably every chick that was on that is

00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:29.839
[ __ ] terrifying and embarrassed to be

00:46:29.839 --> 00:46:32.160
clear you were thinking that while you

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.880
were in a production setting where they

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.000
hired you

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.280

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.040
your previous agency uta uta dropped

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.480

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.280
legitimate i could no that i i just got

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.040
a check [ __ ] from them that baby

00:50:29.119 --> 00:50:32.000
yeah i know all right no uta didn't i

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.440
just this is what i want to know how

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.160
long

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.839
were you with your previous agency

00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:40.480
that was my first agent they were my

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.119
only one i was when i moved to new york

00:50:43.119 --> 00:50:44.880
uh they picked me up and actually when

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.720
they picked me up they were like do you

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.400
want to do snl

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.520
that was like one of their early

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.720
questions when they picked me up and i

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.200
was like no

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.880
like i was like no i don't want [ __ ]

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.720
that's not my goal smarter than me i was

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.800
like my goal is to do stand-up

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.160
i was like i just want to have a good

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.839
special and they're like you sure you

00:51:01.839 --> 00:51:05.040
don't want to do snow i was like i mean

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.440
would i be on snl [ __ ] yeah i would take

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.280
why why would they think that you well

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.680
you talk to their

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.559
duke characters or anything i can i can

00:51:14.559 --> 00:51:16.480
act but i mean were you doing that in

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.079
anything that they saw

00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:20.960
they'd see me do voices that's really it

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.640
i mean i wasn't like on stage i'm not

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.319
real i don't know if you can

00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:25.920
look at me until i'm not moving around a

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.280
lot on stage

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.720
but that's why i'm saying why would they

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.040
think that you were appropriate for it

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.240
i mean i was

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.440
i obviously got it i think it

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.200
aggressively i was pretty they called it

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.040
i got it right away

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.280
i got cast immediately but was someone

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.240
at uta like championing championing your

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.800
cause like hey this is the guy you need

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.880
to get into uh they were like

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.359
um i don't know they they were just like

00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:52.240
lauren

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.079
michaels seems to like

00:51:54.079 --> 00:51:57.520
like big funny people like funny men

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.880
like men

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.400
because right now they don't have any

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.160
well they have a couple but like

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.240
it's mostly like it's all [ __ ] and

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.359
women and that's what it's been since

00:52:07.359 --> 00:52:10.000
you know [ __ ] tina fey

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.839
yeah and then uh sidebar your honor

00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:15.760
tina fey

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.359
ruined an insurance commercial

00:52:19.359 --> 00:52:20.720
you know yeah

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.119
mayhem rules and she did ruin it every

00:52:23.119 --> 00:52:25.359
insurance commercial every single

00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:27.200
company is guilty of the worst

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.680
commercials ever that ruin football

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.440
that's the only time i have to see them

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.480
because everything else i dvr or netflix

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.599
so

00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:37.839
insurance commercials everyone that was

00:52:37.839 --> 00:52:40.000
the only good one and then they put tina

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.240
fey in it that was the only good one

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.839
do you think maybe it was a

00:52:43.839 --> 00:52:45.680
a jerry seinfeld where like she owned

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:46.800
the company

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.440
that was selling the commercial

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.520
to the insurance company all i know is i

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.920
saw tina fey and mayhem in the same

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.599
commercial mayhem stands out it's like

00:52:55.599 --> 00:52:58.319
the energizer bunny yep he could sell it

00:52:58.319 --> 00:53:01.280
yeah he's a bigger celebrity to me

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.760
if i had to get a tattoo

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.319
of a commercial

00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:08.079
that's a good [ __ ]

00:53:08.079 --> 00:53:10.800
that is as good as your bill murray and

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.720
someone else to drink with if you had to

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:15.200
get a tattoo of this or that that's a

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.480
[ __ ] another good one

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.240
there was an old game we used to play

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.319
who would you rather day drink with and

00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:22.240
it started with uh

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.319
that's my phone don't worry

00:53:24.319 --> 00:53:26.839
it's if it's bingo she'll call

00:53:26.839 --> 00:53:30.079
uh was uh it started with who would you

00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:32.000
rather day drink with

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.680
uh uh

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.480
charles bukowski or hunter s thompson

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.079
day drink

00:53:38.079 --> 00:53:39.520

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.839
hunter

00:53:41.839 --> 00:53:43.359
would be

00:53:43.359 --> 00:53:45.200
yeah i guess the daydrink part does

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.640
change it because night drinking is

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.880
where bukowski would get ugly see i knew

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.040
she'd call after she texted do you want

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.319
to put her in

00:53:52.319 --> 00:53:54.079

um but yeah i i hear you on the bukowski

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.559
argument there that's a good argument

00:54:46.559 --> 00:54:48.880
anyway but we've yeah this is

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.680

presidential right yeah no no i think he

00:57:06.799 --> 00:57:08.640
found god

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.359
the point is point in time

00:57:11.359 --> 00:57:12.880
yeah i mean there's a million people

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.200
that nobody knows i'd rather day drink

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.760
with and george bush in his prime was

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.599
someone nobody would know

00:57:19.599 --> 00:57:21.680
wait that's watching footage george bush

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.200
drinking it drinking there's some

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.200
footage of george bush

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.200
the point of the game is to try to make

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.440
uh like uh

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.960

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.200
best team of all time yeah yeah who's

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.040
the dream team fantasy it's a fantasy

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.960
drinking time um

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.960
i'm trying to think

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:42.160
if it finally comes down to uh john daly

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:44.000
john daly the golfer that'd be a good

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.160
one it's a good one but who's a good day

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:47.680
drinker he's like drinking i can't match

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.520
him against bill murray but there they

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.799
go

00:57:50.799 --> 00:57:52.720
actually those two would rather drink

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.480
would

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.040
there you go oh that's to

00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:01.839
another [ __ ] legendary sports partier

00:58:01.839 --> 00:58:04.000
but but uh bill murray is a classic

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.760
daley's not a legendary he's like a

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.720
[ __ ]

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.400
he pulls his rv in front of a hooters

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.000
now he sells he's like john kennedy

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.839
blacks out during the day he's here that

00:58:11.839 --> 00:58:15.599
guy [ __ ] rules that's a good no he is

00:58:15.599 --> 00:58:17.520
but it's it's it that's kind of an

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.319
apples and oranges thing where he's not

00:58:20.319 --> 00:58:23.520
the same as a hunter or a bukowski where

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.119
they're both authors they're both

00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:26.559
legendary maps yeah i wonder if

00:58:26.559 --> 00:58:28.559
hemingway would be a [ __ ] to drink with

00:58:28.559 --> 00:58:32.640
uh he'd probably make you fish or hunt

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.440
what's wrong with that

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.640
day drinking

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:37.680
well i mean

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.240
you try hunting well i guess that's day

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.880
drinking it is i

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.920
i assume the camera angles are where the

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.319
audience doesn't realize that you have

00:58:48.319 --> 00:58:50.000
never looked at him once he told me not

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.839
to oh good it said well i don't know i'm

00:58:51.839 --> 00:58:54.160
not being an [ __ ] he told me not to

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.680
you're doing great dude yeah are you

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.559
kidding me

00:58:56.559 --> 00:58:57.920
i can't believe doug's thinking about

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.079
that you're doing great it's it that

00:59:00.079 --> 00:59:01.440
comes up when you're drunk that would

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.799
bother me i'd be like what's this guy an

00:59:02.799 --> 00:59:04.640
[ __ ] he's not going to look at jaylee

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.680
mostly

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.920
earlier is what we both hate being on

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.400
camera but if you don't see ourselves

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.160
no but that's why he really has it set

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.839
up like this before we started he was

00:59:13.839 --> 00:59:15.520
like it's set up like this don't don't

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.799
look at me we're not talking like

00:59:16.799 --> 00:59:18.559
that'll be tough but all right

00:59:18.559 --> 00:59:19.760
i've heard have you i don't know if

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:22.480
you've acted or anything where

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.559
you see yourself on the monitor and go

00:59:24.559 --> 00:59:26.319
oh [ __ ] i can't do this yeah i saw

00:59:26.319 --> 00:59:27.839
myself on that monitor and i was like i

00:59:27.839 --> 00:59:29.839
need a haircut and to lose how great

00:59:29.839 --> 00:59:31.920
that look at that shot look at that shot

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:33.040
that's perfect

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.960
that's perfect you guys are looking at

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.319
each other like you're talking i've

00:59:36.319 --> 00:59:37.920
reversed your angle doug so you're

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.200
looking at him so it's more uh it looks

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.319
better for the uh the audience we if we

00:59:44.319 --> 00:59:47.119
did this like issues with andy i would

00:59:47.119 --> 00:59:49.760
have the fourth person in the screen be

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.079
someone who would remind us of where we

00:59:52.079 --> 00:59:54.799

01:00:03.839 --> 01:00:06.079
story was we could never find anyone

01:00:06.079 --> 01:00:09.680
that people could beat bill murray

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.720
i'd drink mitch hedberg

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.240
and that's and then he'd leave and go

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.040

the problem is like we all now

01:08:09.039 --> 01:08:12.079
comics are actually in the focal point

01:08:12.079 --> 01:08:13.920
for once

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.640
and everyone has to address the issue

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.880
about what we can and can't say in

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.920
comedy which we never got in the [ __ ]

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.480
spotlight so it's kind of good it's kind

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.120
of good yeah it's all right

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.679
trust me it's all right

01:08:29.679 --> 01:08:31.440
[ __ ] kind of sucks

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.480
uh no it's it's yeah i hear you it's it

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.560
we shouldn't be we should comedian

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.400
should never do this in this well they

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.839
shouldn't be in this spotlight at all

01:08:39.839 --> 01:08:40.880
for

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.400
like hey what do you guys have to say

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.719
that's important it's like sure some

01:08:44.719 --> 01:08:46.000
things but like

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.560
there's a million [ __ ] retards doing

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.480
stand up right now and none of them

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.440
should be

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.880
discussing things

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.199
like i i all of a sudden we have very

01:08:55.199 --> 01:08:58.400
political comedians that

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.520
like i i ran for president in 2007 for

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.520
like six months and then i went i don't

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:06.080
know anything about politics

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.080
because i ran on a libertarian that was

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.080
why you stopped no

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.920
yeah it was one of the reasons because

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.239
it wasn't fun because i realized i have

01:09:14.239 --> 01:09:16.719
no idea what i'm talking about yeah so i

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.560
would challenge you a lot of good

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.560
friends of mine that are on twitter that

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.319
went from funny to

01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:25.359
oh we need to do this and this person

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:27.040
needs to

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.600
okay run for president on that ticket

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.319
and then realize when you get questioned

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:35.759
by a third party that's even negligible

01:09:35.759 --> 01:09:37.520
and they go well how do you feel about

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.480
this and this and you go

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.799
how does that work well it's yeah it's

01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:44.400
funny to hear all these especially like

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:47.359
veteran comics now because like you can

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.600
uh like it's easy to like talk it's you

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.440
can say horrible [ __ ] your whole career

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.120
and then once you're famous you can pull

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.360
that ladder up and be like no one should

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.760
be talking that way or be saying those

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.400
things just drop the name go ahead no

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.440
there's a million of them there's a

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.679
million it's like but it's funny to be

01:10:03.679 --> 01:10:05.440
like listening to somebody discuss

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.960
political issues it's like dude i've

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.640
seen you do blackface

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.840
like what are you talking about i i i

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.520
have a picture of me uh in uh

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.960

where it was halloween and that's the

01:10:22.239 --> 01:10:24.800
last time i actually put on a costume

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.880
on stage on a vegetable

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.920
yeah but i only had like a you know just

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.920

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.040
the script yeah yeah yeah yeah

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.280
a heckler says something and you go and

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.600
have you heard about mutton busting

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.560
where kids write on cheat i don't react

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.960
i i have nothing

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.520
jemima that's funny

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.120
and if if you if i was famous in a place

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.679
where blackface could take me down

01:11:13.679 --> 01:11:16.159
all they would have to do is play like i

01:11:16.159 --> 01:11:17.920
had like two jokes about the ancient

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.920
mama costume and then it's back into my

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.880
dumb [ __ ] awful yeah

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.679
that a throat three-year-old comic does

01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:27.199
and then you just have to play the rest

01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:29.840
of that 25-minute set and they'd go oh

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.640
he's exonerated he already did his time

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.159
yeah [ __ ]

01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:36.159
well that's what sucks about it is like

01:11:36.159 --> 01:11:38.400
my my podcast the one i got fired for is

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.080
like it's just me and my friend and

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.000
we're idiots like it's literally it's

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.280
like listening to two eighth graders

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.080
talk

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.600
so it's like me and him like farts you

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.920
ever fart and your boner is this way and

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:51.280
it's like so now cnn is looking at that

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.280
and like tweeting that i called

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.760
confederate soldiers gay

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.080
from the civil war like that's like a

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.719
real they're they they comb through

01:12:00.719 --> 01:12:03.280
comedians yeah [ __ ] that they're

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.199
obviously

01:12:05.199 --> 01:12:06.480
i knew it was [ __ ] that's why i was

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.560
saying it i was spewing nonsense they're

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.320
looking for something salacious and

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.840
they're like here's a real quote and

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.199
they type it out

01:12:13.199 --> 01:12:14.960
it's like dude you guys are yeah aren't

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.320
you guys adults you went to college for

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.640
that you went to columbia and you're

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.280
following my podcast that's

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.199
what we were talking about earlier it's

01:12:23.199 --> 01:12:24.480
wild is

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.520
you

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.640
you have to lose 50 of your audience to

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.679
gain a [ __ ] following yeah

01:12:31.679 --> 01:12:33.360
you're talking about

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.480
you know you you're doing shows a lot of

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.719
the time to people who just show up for

01:12:38.719 --> 01:12:41.120
comedy night yeah not for shane gillis

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.360
yeah and you were talking about was it

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.400
baltimore yeah yeah no i was in uh i was

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.040
in buffalo i i was talking about how uh

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:52.560
i actually in real life i walk more

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.080
conservatives

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.920
like typically when people leave my show

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.280
it's because they're

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.440
like really into trump and if you run

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.920
into like somebody that like loves trump

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.199
if you even

01:13:03.199 --> 01:13:05.120
mention him at all in a bad way they're

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.080
[ __ ]

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.679
giving it to you

01:13:07.679 --> 01:13:08.560
and then

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.880
like yelling at the cowboys that's for

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.120
sure yeah they scream and right i mean

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.440
look i don't i know you guys hate this

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.480
you know hate trump whatever i don't

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.560
whoa whoa whoa he was talking to the

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.080
listener

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.239
no but i'm saying like they have been

01:13:24.239 --> 01:13:26.000
battered they aren't like if you're a

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.440
trump supporter you're like a battered

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.040
woman like

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.199
your guy has just been through the

01:13:31.199 --> 01:13:33.280
ringer since day one so like they're

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.560
like all right let's have a nice night

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.400
and then here's a comedian on stage

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.000
that's like it'd be funny if trump got

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.120
shot

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.360
the footage would be great

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.800
and then you know so i get why they're

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.480
freaking out i just wish they understood

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.000
it was a joke but i guess what i'm

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.199
saying is

01:13:47.199 --> 01:13:48.480
it's funny that in real life the

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.159
conservative people seem to be the ones

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:52.159
to freak out and then you know online

01:13:52.159 --> 01:13:54.560
and career-wise it's the the liberal the

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.480
left is just the biggest bunch of

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.920
[ __ ] they're the biggest bunch of

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.719
[ __ ] on earth let's uh

01:14:00.719 --> 01:14:02.239
they're just training at all

01:14:02.239 --> 01:14:04.960
yeah because i i don't do whatever oh

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.640
you yeah yeah

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.000
like

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.239
or maybe just edibles he's living at

01:14:10.239 --> 01:14:11.520
your house wait what are we trying to

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.960
tripping on mushrooms oh 100 i did yes

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.880
but in mushrooms last week

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.360
i've fantasized about the uh

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:22.000
just trying to [ __ ] make a third

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.960
party out of the two parties

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:27.120
it needs it needs done and i think it is

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.640
going to happen i think

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.800
of all the you know whatever happens we

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.960
[ __ ] reach across the aisles and

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.120
that's what the the press is doing like

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.400
we said with uh skankfest that whole the

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.920
oakerson

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.880
people like they're being labeled as alt

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.120
right because they're not and i went

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.760
through this with you know when i was

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.679
against george bush

01:14:49.679 --> 01:14:52.000
that meant i was a liberal no i'm a

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
[ __ ] realist or whatever you want to

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.560
[ __ ] call me i i don't care about any

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.600
party not black or white yeah yeah

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.239
j

01:15:00.239 --> 01:15:02.960
j ew gerson is being branded yeah oh

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:04.320
well that was that was uh that was

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.760
because of me

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.760
that was uh well they were kind of

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.000
because they had milo on their podcast

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.520
indianapolis but they you know the

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:14.080
[ __ ] interview

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.080
it's not the fans know

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.199
that's the point is the fans exactly

01:15:21.199 --> 01:15:22.400
it's it's

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.960
whatever media and then there's eight

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.920
people that take an opinion and they go

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:30.719
people are outraged no eight people that

01:15:30.719 --> 01:15:32.719
want to [ __ ] get their tweet read or

01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:35.520
outraged someone who has a

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.840
social media savvy has all of a sudden

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.080
made this a thing i'm saying shane

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.800
gillis and i should get high

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.000
and figure out how to solve the world

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:46.960
he's

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.960
god did not send him across a

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.360
virus-plagued nation

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.880
to come here

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.760
for wisdom for us not to come up with a

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.719
salute damn it you're right i am right

01:15:58.719 --> 01:16:00.560
god do you know how long it's been since

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:03.760
i talked to a comedian

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.320
i would rather do a mushroom uh podcast

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.640
than a pot like yeah i don't i don't

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.320
like pot but i do like mushrooms a lot

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.760
i'm too uneasy on that i i tried two

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:16.080
times to do a podcast tried more than

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.920
that and

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.560
really yeah i remember too recently

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.840
yeah

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.600
i don't like it's not that it's not

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.600
entertaining no it's edibles it's

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.239
different yeah it's it's a it's a weird

01:16:28.239 --> 01:16:30.560
thing for you to gauge whereas i think

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.159
mushrooms we could do that better and

01:16:32.159 --> 01:16:34.480
tracy's

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.719
the four of us would be down we'd always

01:16:36.719 --> 01:16:38.320
we'd all be down

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.640
yeah i know what i know a local drug

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.840
dealer

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.520
that's a call back to a private

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.320
conversation

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.920
but i i wanted to throw my hat in the

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.600
