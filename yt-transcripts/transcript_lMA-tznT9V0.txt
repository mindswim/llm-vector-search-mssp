like Fanta like summed up my existence

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:54.869

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.689
two [ __ ] losers on account commercial

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.329

and turn it and it like no they're

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.770
making fun of [ __ ] white people yeah

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.270
and they weren't trying to make funny

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.510
you know they would see what you liked

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.500
like what are the kids like these days

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.950

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:55.000

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.340
just like this I would like to find out

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.080
who wrote that because I guarantee it's

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.560
a [ __ ] like Filipino lesbian wrote

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.990
that oh really yeah

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.700
but they actually Saturday Night Live do

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.380

calls people he's like here's what the

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.770
premise is tell me what you think and

nobody likes it no he's like you think

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.310
it sounds racist and he looks over and

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.720
sees the two black guys dancing he's

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.760
like oh [ __ ] but it is it is funny that

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.860
even a commercial catered to those

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.380

child boy he was approached I think he

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.090

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.950
legalize taking pictures of the kid also

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.710

that's what gets scary cuz what are we

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.100
that's the question so I have to ask

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.950
myself like if you are who you surround

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:10.580
yourself with

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.500

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.570
some [ __ ] idiots I think it's a lion

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:15.800
pit I think you're just you're just

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.480

oh [ __ ] yeah I'm out yeah you're all

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.720
doomed to death and then if people laugh

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.190
it's like let them go and you're like

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.350

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.800

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:30.280
[ __ ] new to man in that holding cell

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.640

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.250
fall for our civil liberties dude that

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:37.830
was the best when I did that down and uh

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:40.210
when I got a permit for my dad I got

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:41.380
like caught up with some bureaucratic

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.730
[ __ ] dude and they're like they sent

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:44.140
me to the wrong line I waited for two

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.770
hours and the lady was like you're the

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:49.060
wrong forms and I was like you're a

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.430
servant of the law and my tax dollars

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:53.050

instantly fold it like yeah you're right

00:45:56.859 --> 00:45:58.510

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:00.369
tax goes to this specifically so that

00:46:00.369 --> 00:46:02.940
someone else pays you fully [ __ ] it out

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:07.240
and then they drugged you alligator if

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.380
that's just how that Asian dude gets

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:12.340
around that wasn't him getting bullied

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:15.070
