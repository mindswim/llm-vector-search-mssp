saddest story dude he used to [ __ ]

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.850
man he was a little kid his dad tried to

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.640
shoot him did he miss or did he hit him

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.210

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.310
okay the story's getting a little less

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:44.520
sad

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:51.250
drunk he's infamous drunk plumber I do

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:54.010
people Judy brought six where he brought

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.530
it's likely Ridley Park area yeah so I

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:57.849
was like you know it's like we already

00:43:57.849 --> 00:43:59.410
have enough information we're [ __ ]

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:01.690
locked in order in Delaware County yeah

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.869
it's a Greeley Park area so I heard from

00:44:04.869 --> 00:44:06.430
word of mouth that his dad used to bring

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:07.810
like a lunch cooler but was like six

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.310
beers squeezed into it and had to drink

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:10.660
six beers before he could really like

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:12.339
start his day so this is the town

00:44:12.339 --> 00:44:14.230
getting this is the origin story yeah

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:15.880
this man has a son and apparently at one

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.670
point so it tries to shoot him all the

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:26.440
cases like it was probably like 12 he

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:36.070
was just being a teen yeah had basically

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:41.170
no country for old man him and then like

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.180
they own the dad got in trouble so I

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.440
mean the student had [ __ ] problems

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.760
due but he would he would get his

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.579
paycheck and bike rack and get hookers

00:44:48.579 --> 00:44:50.050
right away that was like always burn his

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:52.180
paycheck but he would plumbing in the

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:57.700
drinking his what he was no dad what the

00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.260
prolate he's not gonna speak for him but

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.720
I'd imagine he maybe dabbled but his the

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.700
guy who got shot at the Sun he's hookers

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.420
incorrect he's all hookers and crash

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.210
crackers do just like that crack crack

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:11.890
was the main cracks the main twist they

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:16.660
also did masonry bad ok what and then

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:17.740
the hookers were just like if you're

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.540
balling or you're balling hard I gotcha

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.920
cuz if you smoke crack for a while you

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.089
kind of need to start smoking crack with

00:45:22.089 --> 00:45:23.859
hookers otherwise it's like what's the

00:45:23.859 --> 00:45:25.450
point if you're smoking crack for long

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:27.700
enough you you kind of like associate

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.770
with hookers by proxy heavily it's a

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:32.260
weird loneliness yeah it's very specific

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.819
loneliness well yeah because you can

00:45:33.819 --> 00:45:35.470
like well you can get a hooker then get

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:43.119
crack from a hooker crack by drugs

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:45.040
through prostitutes yeah if you come to

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.450
a town on business you don't know anyone

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:48.760
you hire a hooker have sex I can safely

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.040
buy drugs off this person yeah the crack

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.170
world the hooker world are like peas in

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:53.560
a pod

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.000
they're like priests and nuns

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.230
but he would yeah he would like bike

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:59.760
rack and then get hookers and walk

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.070

[ __ ] letter job that's why like you

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.350
know the intersection homeless people

00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:30.390
that sit there with like a sign yeah I

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:32.880
think hookers infiltrated that racket in

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.170
my neighborhood so they like get on a

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:36.240
like on an intersection and like they'll

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.520
also hop in a car yeah really good I've

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.960
actually wondered that because I've gone

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.730
anyone who's begging for money who's

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:44.150
like not even attractive but like oh

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:46.650
like at all just not like completely

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:47.940
devastating look at I'm yeah I'm always

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.950
like are you like yeah that's such a

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:51.720
good idea for hooker to know little

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.580
bottle no one will bother a panhandler

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:55.500
but if you're just like being sexy it's

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.270
like turn it's like driving uber in the

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:00.540
same time you got both apps on which

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.580
everyone comes on first if you're

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:06.900
sexually dipping out I think all of us

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.890
before our [ __ ] [ __ ] men to jump in

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:11.490
why not

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:13.470
do you offer enough money yeah I mean

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:15.180
how I mean dude how many days would you

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.630
go outside before you'd suck a dick oh

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:19.620
serious depends on the environment if

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.390
I'm in the wilderness I could probably

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:26.690
stretch it out way longer probably suck

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:30.750
in the woods and kill him and go right

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:44.760
back home damn what a twist that would

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.260
be on the guy who was sitting up in a

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:52.230
conundrum joke's on you every day I'm

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:53.580

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:12.150
will know so I can come out of the woods

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:13.230
you guys don't want to suck people in

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:15.750
the woods you're free people are gonna

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:17.970

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:25.740
[Laughter]

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:56.150
[Laughter]

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:06.280
sucker kill dude there's like a thing

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:08.170
we're like it's the robbers paradox

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:09.609
we're like you get two strangers and

00:51:09.609 --> 00:51:14.200
you're like alright if you both say let

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.430
the other person keep the money you're

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:17.470
gonna get 25 bucks but if one of you

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:20.349
says if you both say keep like one of

00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:21.670
you says keep it you get 50 and the

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:22.510
other guy gets nothing

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:24.310
but if you both say keep it none of you

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:25.750
had anything it's kind of like one of

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:28.510
those the prisoner's dilemma yeah we

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:29.680
have a degree in this [ __ ] what are you

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.550
talking about your honorable business

00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:35.800
that's a prisoner's dilemma yeah yeah

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.180
that relates to this somehow

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.330
talk Moscow sucking or killing yeah so

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:41.740
you could have people like you instantly

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:42.910
you meet up it's like a wrestling match

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:46.960
you start out like a quick 69 and if you

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.650
break this suck whoever breaks the first

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:52.240
time to kill that guy but if you both

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.740
break it you both die so you're just

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.720
like it's a true Russian Roulette

00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:00.220
situation you have to stay on for five

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.750
seconds like one two three but if you

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:03.970
both pull off at the same time both of

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:05.530
you die what if you both finish each

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:16.390
other I mean you have a dick in your

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:17.700
mouth you might as well make it come

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.109
talking about that's it from the jump

00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:22.020
you got to decide that - what that's

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.070
enough stayin on this and then whoever

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:25.750
comes in this choice the only way out is

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:27.160
either to pull your mouth off or

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.760
come-come pops off first wins wait

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:32.460
what's the

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.200
what's the sweet spot here do you want

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.780
to finish them or you try to like quit

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.430
at the right time to Exim eyes your

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:47.070
prize Bank somebody comes later it's

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:49.080
like right before the bell is like oh I

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.430
can crack over home and match dude you

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:53.340
[ __ ] cool pop in there enough it's a

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.690
suck quick stock everyone everyone in

00:52:54.690 --> 00:53:00.900
good strength right off the bat click

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:14.730
like the guy looks like dude to people

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:16.410
just like the eyes just wide with fear

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:18.450
dude looking up in the ref dicks in each

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:21.990
other's mouths 1 2 3 4 5 and whistle

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.700
blows so if they both pull off at the

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.410
same time they both die right but then

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:26.760
if so if you're staying on you're

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.750
playing like a little chicken like the

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:30.090
game is slapstick my goal if you can

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.940
come first before the guy falls off that

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.070
you get to live so either you pull off

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:36.480
real quick without them going off at the

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.310
same time or you come in the person's

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:40.110
mouth and you live it's come and live

00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:52.590
pull off and live no so I go firt no

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:55.770
yeah but you could you could hide the

00:53:55.770 --> 00:54:06.960
fact that they were coming so you you

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.750
can detach after you come do all of you

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:14.010
oh yeah the first thing or you stop I'm

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:16.710
not letting this go after they come or

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:18.840
you stop sucking after okay so you can

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.520
stop sucking after you come if you come

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.560
but if them come you can stop sucking if

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.110
you come and like oh you have no self

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:26.610
account compliance I think the coming

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:29.040
your enforce a break with come then you

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:29.520
win

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.560
but if if you come and they just [ __ ]

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.360
champion quietly the ref is none the

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:33.510
wiser

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:35.330
[Laughter]

00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:37.980
then there's one guys known for sucking

00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:39.510
two or three times before actually

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.810
winning

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:43.790
[Laughter]

00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:46.220
so you finish in their mouth first and

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:48.740
like to the point where they go come

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:51.110
hard enough for them to quit that's why

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:52.490
I like you doing two three matches in a

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:55.190
day you're gonna trail off you're gonna

[Laughter]

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:05.540
like lettuce like chicken it's like the

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.190

00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:33.690
sack of [ __ ] yeah I feel like I only

00:59:33.690 --> 00:59:35.730

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:37.920
yeah oh absolutely

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.980
disturbingly late yeah it's really

00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:44.100
[ __ ] up mm-hmm I was uh I was thinking

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:46.620
today about I was reading a book dude

00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:47.610
it's really good it's called all things

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:49.710
shining when they talk about Dante's

00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:51.570
Inferno that whole thing and they said

00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:53.940
how hell isn't built like a it sounded

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:55.230
like people thought before like hell was

00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:56.760
a place you got like sucked into when

00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:58.860
you were like being real bad after Santa

00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:02.340
Claus you get sucked into hell and like

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.410
it was a Devil's pond you in [ __ ] a

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:07.650
the the book Dante basically hell this

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:09.510
is the Thomas Aquinas version this is

01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:11.970
out Thomas Aquinas Beutel was just that

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:13.410
it was a place they were keeping God out

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:15.720
of yeah I thought that was so [ __ ]

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:21.540
cool spiritual intelligence right there

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.670
yeah dude exactly your [ __ ] spiritual

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:29.760
genius thank you guys right bring I just

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.380
like write compliments about myself and

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:35.220
past merrily oh yeah what's funny is I

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.230
was actually thinking about just doing a

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:38.580
podcast where I just call friends and

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:40.590
like push them on you know what I mean

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:42.060
like I just call people and like

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:44.610
encourage them on what I like about him

01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:46.410
I just encourage them oh baby like 10

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:48.420
minutes long or just be unexpected phone

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:50.370
call oh and like I definitely do not

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:59.060
think it would go well for the most part

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.590
the not going well I think would be

01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:03.420
pretty devastating yeah you know

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.250
psychotic yeah the haters would get

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:08.010
tired of hating on that where now if you

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:09.780
go full imperviousness on haters they

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.270
get tired they're like yeah okay as soon

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:13.650
as you give if you like or like if you

01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:15.270
let them in that's over if you go full

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:16.710
impervious and you just did a very nice

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:19.230
positive podcast I'd be so wonderful

01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:20.369
wouldn't it

01:01:20.369 --> 01:01:22.589
a problem with that you have a let me

01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:24.839
start your version of positivity which

01:01:24.839 --> 01:01:26.430
I'm sure would include calling them a

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:28.920
[ __ ] awesome yeah exactly

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.900
no way dude it has to be super sweet

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:33.900
yeah but that's the thing man pretty

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.640
sweet my friends know that about me I'm

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.749
a five-cent sweetheart

01:01:36.749 --> 01:01:38.190
it is funny if it's more palatable

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:40.170
someone's like you [ __ ] you're doing

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:40.680
great

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.269
it's like I mean I would just love a

01:01:42.269 --> 01:01:56.460
very clean positive it's weird to think

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.779
that that would be a bad thing in the

01:01:57.779 --> 01:01:58.109
world

01:01:58.109 --> 01:01:59.970
no to have something like I'm sort of

01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:03.059
podcast there are a couple of ways that

01:02:03.059 --> 01:02:04.769
it would be stupid is if the person

01:02:04.769 --> 01:02:06.480
doing it was like either doing an awful

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.519
job or like doing something pretentious

01:02:08.519 --> 01:02:09.299
about it

01:02:09.299 --> 01:02:11.609
like the guy with the [ __ ] books

01:02:11.609 --> 01:02:13.319
like that reads the [ __ ] kids like

01:02:13.319 --> 01:02:14.910
clearly that's dudes doing that because

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:16.079
he's like the way it looks

01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:19.710
dumbest idea I've ever sure yeah yeah so

01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:21.329
if that was obvious then it would suck

01:02:21.329 --> 01:02:25.230
dick I think the only way that would be

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:29.930
bad dude it was really boring and lower

01:02:30.019 --> 01:02:33.029
that's like perfect yeah it's not

01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:34.049
talking to someone on the phone for more

01:02:34.049 --> 01:02:38.009
than 10 minutes yes you probably knock

01:02:38.009 --> 01:02:40.140
this thing out in 90 seconds sure it'd

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.509
be so easy no be cool to if you did it

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.940
and it just it had a it was a podcast

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.230
that just you just there was a gonna

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.150
like a message in a bottle kind of thing

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:49.650
when you did it to one person and he's

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:50.940
emailed I'm like here's the instructions

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.380
record on your phone put it on this link

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:58.529
and then they did it someone else came

01:02:58.529 --> 01:02:59.910
with instructions like you have to if

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:01.109
you don't do this it's like they don't

01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:02.339
do it a couple days you've afford it to

01:03:02.339 --> 01:03:03.749
someone else and I'm sure like there

01:03:03.749 --> 01:03:04.829
would be like biters that would like

01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:07.319
splinter off their own drill bit

01:03:07.319 --> 01:03:08.670
download one and do a room but there'd

01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:12.569
be like the main message they can start

01:03:12.569 --> 01:03:24.150
an open source by rejecting you know

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:26.670
attention loiter and impenitent lawyers

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:29.930
I call trademark now

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.290
to 53 71 2019 I'll split it with you for

01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:35.960
sure oh for sure that's a that's the way

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.870
this business goes Wow dan open-source

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:40.820
podcast but it's only word-of-mouth the

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.410
people you think are sweet as [ __ ]

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:45.380
oh yeah well like I said you ever get it

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:48.490
you get one person is everyone gets one

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:51.350
people know that no missing settings on

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:53.030
a trap what do you say everyone gets one

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:57.920
pick and no repeats yeah so like I said

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.410
there will be one core chain of a trail

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:02.180
of phone calls and they'll put it in the

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.380
Library of Congress or something because

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:06.230
it's boring and impactful because that's

01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:07.430
the thing too like if you had it you

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:08.780
could put it out it could go like to

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:09.860
another country before it even comes

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.220
thank you have to start it with like

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:25.580
instantly go some more billion people to

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:47.110
do this no Pig I think you are very cool

01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:51.910
[Laughter]

01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:54.500
these ideas very good where you'd have

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.540
to have like a pre-ordered chain of at

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.130
least like seven people so I understood

01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:00.230
what it was and then just go push it out

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:02.000
into the [ __ ] into the way like the

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.920
last print so no before we hand it off

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.450
right I have like a bunch of picture

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:10.660
have it that shame to the world yeah

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:12.550
[Music]

01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:13.790
yeah

01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:16.550
that's a great idea damn so you release

01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:18.530
someone one per week right and after the

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:20.150
seventh week were like BAM this person's

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:21.500
gonna pick whoever they were supposed to

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:25.550
set in it out yeah I think that's like

01:05:25.550 --> 01:05:26.780
that's probably how Pharrell felt when

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.810
he wrote happy

01:05:27.810 --> 01:05:30.860
[Music]

01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:35.069
by pharrell that was a nice song

01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:37.569
everyone was so happy we got soft over

01:05:37.569 --> 01:05:40.089
what happened any oh my god yes um about

01:05:40.089 --> 01:05:42.450
how I'm almost positive he got [ __ ]

01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:44.739
crushed on that deal like his label just

01:05:44.739 --> 01:05:46.390
[ __ ] him on it I'm just late hey any

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:48.519

01:05:48.519 --> 01:05:49.869
know I can't even give you the facts but

01:05:49.869 --> 01:05:52.150
I know for because there was a big story

01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:55.809
about how well that became a global

01:05:55.809 --> 01:05:58.450
phenomena yeah that was all over it was

01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:01.420
like the new Macarena yeah I mean it was

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.609
imagine [ __ ] someone out of a deal

01:06:03.609 --> 01:06:05.200
that was a song they wrote about being

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:14.109
happy but he definitely liked no one no

01:06:14.109 --> 01:06:15.819
person ever makes money in any of that

01:06:15.819 --> 01:06:20.890
[ __ ] I mean Soulja Boy made like 150

01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:22.239
million less you start your own way if

01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:23.349
you don't start your own label you kind

01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:24.700
of read this thing about how like

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.739
officially the first men in black movie

01:06:26.739 --> 01:06:29.019
has never made any money and they like

01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:31.450
never paid the writer how that's the

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:34.059
thing obviously but like if you look at

01:06:34.059 --> 01:06:36.069
the records like well you know they

01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:38.529
tally at the end we're negative 100

01:06:38.529 --> 01:06:40.059
million dollars still on men in black

01:06:40.059 --> 01:06:42.339
what yeah I wonder if but it happens all

01:06:42.339 --> 01:06:43.269
the time what are they on right now it

01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:45.400
might be three they're about to do they

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.509
and they gonna do

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:59.600
[Laughter]

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:22.990
[Laughter]

01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:42.170
[Laughter]

01:07:42.170 --> 01:08:17.120
girls bye-bye son that bike right now

01:08:17.509 --> 01:08:19.859
not with that commercial with that

01:08:19.859 --> 01:08:28.440
commercial you're just launching over

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:33.750
the border I personally you'd sell the

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:37.399
MIB 5jo as illegal in a friendly way

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:41.699
[Laughter]

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:57.650
many black southern border wall Steven

01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:00.390
Steven Baldwin and Tim Allen as the old

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.190
part

01:09:02.190 --> 01:09:11.819
I'll give Tommy Lee Jones wall he like

01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:13.430
this is where we separate the children

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:15.299
they have to make it with like three

01:09:15.299 --> 01:09:18.620
hundred and ninety thousand dollars no

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:26.190
thinking about well getting his song

01:09:26.190 --> 01:09:30.089
stolen happened people try to tell me

01:09:30.089 --> 01:09:33.239
that like we're not control we're gonna

01:09:33.239 --> 01:09:35.339
pay you money off of the profits and

01:09:35.339 --> 01:09:37.109
then it never makes a profit because all

01:09:37.109 --> 01:09:38.520
the while we had to pay this guy I mean

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:41.040
the yeah they do that for like hundreds

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.630
and hundreds of millions of dollars yeah

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:49.199
yeah that's why I think he wasn't his

01:09:49.199 --> 01:09:50.819
contract [ __ ] him over of the damn

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:52.469
sign because I don't think he got a

01:09:52.469 --> 01:10:20.190
piece of that it was like you get dude

01:10:20.190 --> 01:10:22.020
yeah well that's what I was thinking

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:23.250
like you like the way [ __ ] like that

01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:24.989
goes down how much that happens and like

01:10:24.989 --> 01:10:26.640
even like if you if you try to interact

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.460
with like a big company any system it's

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:32.550
infuriating how much they like try to

01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:34.560
[ __ ] you yeah I'd like the front lines

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.719
at every level and it's like that's just

01:10:36.719 --> 01:10:38.130
like the way business is operating

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:39.210
people trying to tell me like the whole

01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:40.620
entire government and society doesn't

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:42.360
operate like this this is clearly

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.940
designed of socio if sociopaths are set

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.350
up a business they're like dude this is

01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:47.880
use robots they're cheaper and we'll

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.170
make this thing hardest but it's like

01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:50.730
set up in a way like alright we're gonna

01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:52.770
do insurance we're gonna try to not pay

01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:54.360
out that's the whole business plan where

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.890
it's like a whole point of insurance is

01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:58.380
that the profit comes from not paying

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.390
people money I mean this is fundamental

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:03.180
to social power structures I mean you

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:06.360
have to [ __ ] just crush people every

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.370
step of the way yeah it's all really get

01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:10.110
to the top but like it I always it's

01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:11.489
like kind of it seems like a distant

01:11:11.489 --> 01:11:12.780
thing but then like any company I

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.429
interact with is like trying to [ __ ] me

01:11:14.429 --> 01:11:15.659
as fast as it can

01:11:15.659 --> 01:11:17.670
and it's someone's job to figure out

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:19.080
like why is it taking so long to [ __ ]

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.090
these people why we gotta bring these

01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:23.489
numbers down he was on the phone for

01:11:23.489 --> 01:11:25.800
minutes and he sounded okay when he got

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.090
off what are you guys doing down there I

01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:28.409
have a theory that like when you get if

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:30.330
you go to seek customer service justice

01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:32.670
which I'll like I go I go like full like

01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:33.900
give me your manager give me this person

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.870
I'll go fully ham in a store but I know

01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:38.940
there's a formula where like they send

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:40.830
out a front line that's just a hardened

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:43.500
L and like no it's against policy sorry

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.199
and if you're just like [ __ ] I don't

01:11:46.199 --> 01:11:47.400
believe you let me talk to your manager

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.020
you get to another person I did this

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:50.909
with my unlimited on Verizon they tried

01:11:50.909 --> 01:11:53.040
taking it from me and there's no way we

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.389
can do this and I call them every day

01:11:54.389 --> 01:11:56.159
for like three weeks it was like dude

01:11:56.159 --> 01:12:00.540
it's me give me my own pretty

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.639
complicated mostly goodnight call look

01:12:02.639 --> 01:12:08.400
please like Li's give me my call and

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.449

01:12:09.449 --> 01:12:11.040
manager give me the regional you know if

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.389
you can know the chain of command if you

01:12:12.389 --> 01:12:13.739
know someone is worked in like retail or

01:12:13.739 --> 01:12:16.199
thing you can ask up the chain of

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:17.489
command for some reason if I'm gonna

01:12:17.489 --> 01:12:18.360
threaten to go to the Better Business

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:18.960
Bureau

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.460
they keep connecting you to these like

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:22.440
high up people yeah and if they take

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.880
they won't answer your calls for like

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.800
two weeks and then you know finally

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.120
answer like what do you want you're like

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.860
I want like a that they had my parents

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:34.860
teach Greg get my parents TV for like

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:37.170
two months that was like their TV fix

01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:38.280
I'm like dude what the [ __ ] I went down

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.840
there and I was like this is ridiculous

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.070
like what do you want to do I'm like I

01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:44.010
need like $400 dude they literally gave

01:12:44.010 --> 01:12:50.190
me a $40 gift has that like the double

01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:52.650
sided coin raid where on one side you

01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:54.810
could have somebody who has a craft that

01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:56.460
they work on and then they say how can I

01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:57.840
get this craft out into the world like

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.130
this thing of quality that they produce

01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:01.110
but then the other side you have people

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.969
that can just sit around and say how do

01:13:02.969 --> 01:13:05.639
I just get people to give me money yes

01:13:05.639 --> 01:13:07.500
you know and then there's insurance

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.380
companies which is that this is like so

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.120
that's the other side of capitalism in

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.500
it so you can focus on one or the other

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:17.280
I like the fun part my cool [ __ ] yeah

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.409
but you could also you know go down to a

01:13:19.409 --> 01:13:22.909
bit of a Fabri myself

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:27.400
I mean it's gotta be fun on some little

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.500
to totally dominate everybody around you

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.600
I think it's probably fun on every level

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.100
to dominate I don't know it's robably

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:38.230
really sad actually like okay well

01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:40.630
Jordan peterson says in the short term

01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:42.340
it does provide some sort of like you

01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:43.660
know positive response that but

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.370
long-term it's not sustainable and it'll

01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:48.070
basically ruin here yeah I'm saying I

01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:49.900
don't think guys like Mussolini types to

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:52.750
only die well nothing dies fast and

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:55.000
pretty horribly and usually ruin Gaddafi

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.780
got stabbed in the [ __ ]

01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:01.540
I'm so mad about that yeah I think I was

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.650
looking at around I think having the

01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:06.969
mean that's gotta be true not like

01:14:06.969 --> 01:14:08.650
having the mean do it and not doing it

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:11.770
like that's even better yeah sure buddy

01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:13.330
you know order to have a billion dollars

01:14:13.330 --> 01:14:17.500
you had to have done something that made

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.030
someone be like god there's no clean

01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:22.480
yeah but that was true for a long time

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.520
when most billions were created through

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:27.100
industry like you know like like you

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:29.290
know the pans people's hard work

01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:31.510
man-hours yeah people can become

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:32.860
billionaires overnight because of

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:36.100
technic yeah so it's not that paradigm

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:38.650
or that's not exactly true anymore so

01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:40.120
you can have true

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.770
you can almost have an overnight

01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:44.110
billionaire true but I feel like in

01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:46.239
order to be a billionaire to like be if

01:14:46.239 --> 01:14:48.430
a billion dollars and not just like kind

01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:50.080
of die at your own hands with money you

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.540
have to be a [ __ ] nut dude having a

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:55.120
billion [ __ ] dollars yeah I wouldn't

01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:03.760
stop flying on a plane I would

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.260
definitely get off the ground forever I

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:06.820
would just fly plane to plane and it's

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.850
like do [ __ ] on planes my whole life

01:15:08.850 --> 01:15:14.710
travel I played a plane yeah helicopter

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:21.250
to copter whatever it is that's hard to

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.770
go from any one aircraft to a similar

01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:24.910
aircraft like what balloon to balloon

01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:26.650

these places Satanism yeah that's a

01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:43.940
weird that's weird people get fired up

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:47.120
about immigration it's like you know I'm

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.890
a more the merrier type but it's also if

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.960
you're like yeah but like there's like 3

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.120
billion pork like people who are so poor

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:54.110
they don't know if they're getting food

01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:55.340
like are you sure you can stay right

01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.950
guys don't in like add it in forever

01:18:57.950 --> 01:19:00.680
it's like man I bring that out people

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:01.910
like that's ridiculous it's like dude

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:05.630
I'd love to be wrong but be like is it

01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:07.970
feasible the part of me that's like

01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:09.350
that's sweet I might have said this

01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:10.700
before the part of me that's like that

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:12.410
sweet doesn't is that necessarily the

01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:14.150
part that's usually right yeah like you

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:15.200
know what's sweet you're like yeah but

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.940
here's the deal I'm like a [ __ ] I

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:19.850
like the model of like send over the

01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:21.550
best representative from your family

01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:26.660
yeah so you're saying that they're

01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:29.090
sending some less-than-desirable right

01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:30.980
now and your solutions better no no I

01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:32.810
don't care I don't care I'm saying like

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:34.820
draft a member of your fate like just

01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:37.489
had like huddle yeah yeah I have like a

01:19:37.489 --> 01:19:39.170
little you know the member of your

01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:41.120
family to pick whichever family memory

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.260
care at least about to stay they're

01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:44.750
gonna die yeah I mean listen you gotta

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:46.160
send the person that has the best chance

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.510
to go over and make some money to send

01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:49.670
it back like that's just basically yeah

01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:51.320
what it is I mean cuz it's you can't we

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.880
can't bring the whole thing sometimes

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.340
you get here

01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:58.370
Jesus right yeah yeah yeah he's like am

01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:10.700
i right or like immigration is the

01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.290
weirdest thing where it's like this is

01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:14.450
like um my personal views are like I

01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:15.770
don't even care about maps or countries

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:17.960
or stuff but it's like it doesn't really

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.520
fly but if you were to like just be like

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.840
what people think what they're doing

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:21.920
down there is [ __ ] up and wrong I said

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.930
yeah okay but like can you legitimately

01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:25.550
just be like if we were just like yo

01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:27.230
everyone just come here we got so much

01:20:27.230 --> 01:20:27.680
[ __ ]

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.270
then we're gonna hook you guys up to

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:31.010
intercept you're setting that out to

01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:33.470
like three billion people who are like

01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:35.930
don't have food yeah you know how

01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:37.580
everybody can get here is one thing but

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.830
like that's weird to be like if they say

01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:41.480
anything against again a lot of the

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:42.830
stuff against it's kind of a lot of

01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:43.940
times kind of weird but it's like if

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.260
you're like well is it even feasible

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:53.450
like no one talks about it okay so then

01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:55.100
Trump immediately pulled their [ __ ]

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.390
card it was like all right cool

01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:57.470
you want these immigrants at like a

01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:59.660
flood yeah I don't know what I don't

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:01.040
know the extent of that I just remember

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.420
when that happened I don't my thing is

01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:04.130
like I don't I don't care I don't wear

01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:07.010
my like you know I mean banks are

01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:10.660
getting noisy how the podcasting game I

01:21:13.690 --> 01:21:16.460
don't I don't personally get give a [ __ ]

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.140
I'm not like sitting here you know one

01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:19.640
way or the other on a but if you're like

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:22.970
dude like there's so many people who are

01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:24.980
so [ __ ] the majority people are super

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.450
[ __ ] poor that's not saying my

01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:29.030
solution is sick Drive the best person

01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:30.470
your family send them over the most

01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:33.890
loyal person so dumb well hold on they

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:35.570
don't get completely dumb because they

01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:41.000
get the ball out so what point you know

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.550
there's got to be okay so this they they

01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:45.380
ball out for a while make sure you know

01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:48.250
the family gets money cuz you know yeah

01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:51.830
and then our economy becomes stronger

01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:53.270
because we have people over here

01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:54.500
producing like a [ __ ] because

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:56.570
they have to send trails off that right

01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:58.340
show and they also want to ball out in

01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:00.680
America because I got here yeah so they

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.360
you know they want a Segway or something

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:03.770
you know what I mean yeah enjoy enjoy

01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:05.300
the fruits of your labor right and we're

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:07.369
paying them right

01:22:07.369 --> 01:22:09.409
they're earning their earning every

01:22:09.409 --> 01:22:11.239
dollar they get you know get you know

01:22:11.239 --> 01:22:13.460
little [ __ ] American dream but it's

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:15.500
like I don't

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:16.820
I'm sure thing out I can personally

01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:30.080
benefit off this it's a little eugenics

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.119
this I get it but we're not responsible

01:22:32.119 --> 01:22:34.489
for like they're deciding who gets it

01:22:34.489 --> 01:22:37.099
like at home the family decides who gets

01:22:37.099 --> 01:22:38.270
to come a bit about presentative

01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:39.560
they're the ones to have to like go

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.000
through the hard decision of like

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.590
finally being honest about their family

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:44.090
members wow that was a draft where the

01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:45.530
numbers are so staggering how's the

01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:48.230
draft process work I mean that's that's

01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:50.599
family dude and a big banquet you bet

01:22:50.599 --> 01:22:52.130
how many how many families like is you

01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:53.719
would have the draft process would be

01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:56.840
like maybe like I guess you could do

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.040
like they said they do like two million

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.949
people come in a year yeah so they could

01:23:00.949 --> 01:23:03.020
do I guess two million out of a couple

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.429
billion that would be a cig trapped

01:23:04.429 --> 01:23:14.630
before the contest be all right here

01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:15.980
you're in this group you're in this

01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:17.480
because they have like a hundred battle

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:22.099
Royales and one point they're like they

01:23:22.099 --> 01:23:23.780
they can hold one group that's like

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.250
walking somewhere like whoa hold on and

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:26.570
they're waiting for like the Colosseum

01:23:26.570 --> 01:23:28.130
that they're walking do to finish their

01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:29.989
current match so they can send one

01:23:29.989 --> 01:23:32.110
person out to go through the border of

01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:51.320
the games riding a bike with your

01:23:51.320 --> 01:24:09.139
pregnant girlfriend I'm trying to design

01:24:09.139 --> 01:24:12.409
a system where we're we're we're out of

01:24:12.409 --> 01:24:16.280
the decision-making process America it's

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:18.469
okay now you're gonna say total [ __ ]

01:24:18.469 --> 01:24:19.710
that's gonna mean murders

01:24:19.710 --> 01:24:23.060
all the more reason to pick the

01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:46.380
beginning of the Holocaust okay i'ma say

01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:50.190
thank goodness no I know what you're

01:24:50.190 --> 01:24:51.480
saying that it's a fair point the pair

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:52.500
that's one that they bring up it's

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.180
called brain drain but they say like we

01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:55.500
pretty much tend to get people's best

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.210
and brightest yeah they're saying like

01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:59.370
these countries is being put is like you

01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:03.420
know they come here and they're like we

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.980
should make more race bikes off of each

01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:13.020
other's houses right they should do that

01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:14.610
like who wants to be a millionaire in a

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:19.560
third-world country super hard oh sorry

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:29.130
yeah really hard to phone a friend what

01:25:29.130 --> 01:25:30.690
is the price is right there just crying

01:25:30.690 --> 01:25:38.730
is like all the phrases are wrong it's a

01:25:38.730 --> 01:26:20.760
gallon of milk they're like 45,000 this

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:26.070
settles down we're like I was probably

01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:29.090
stopped they goes well

01:26:29.239 --> 01:26:31.349
and you're the one that keeps you level

01:26:31.349 --> 01:26:35.189
serious conversation is like I knew if I

01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:36.780
brought the whole idea the idea for this

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:39.570
think tank was to like tackle very very

01:26:39.570 --> 01:26:41.489
like complex world issues would you be

01:26:41.489 --> 01:26:43.260

01:26:46.349 --> 01:26:48.860
high as possible trying to attack like

01:27:05.010 --> 01:27:07.169
my house and be like it's so important

01:27:07.169 --> 01:27:08.699
that I clean the kitchen all the way

01:27:08.699 --> 01:27:09.929
like I would like oh you did that today

01:27:09.929 --> 01:27:12.360
yesterday last night I was high in my

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.159
house and I was like what kind of man am

01:27:14.159 --> 01:27:16.469
I do dishes half in the sink you know

01:27:16.469 --> 01:27:18.149
like grill into like cleaning my house

01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:19.439
up and do all this [ __ ] dude it's so

01:27:19.439 --> 01:27:22.889
[ __ ] funny dude you I I'm the same

01:27:22.889 --> 01:27:24.449
way every single time I get high but

01:27:24.449 --> 01:27:49.469
it's like in a different way just like

01:27:49.469 --> 01:27:52.129
ended up it was the angle and the way

01:27:52.129 --> 01:27:56.429
you 200 milligram lollipop oh you gave

01:27:56.429 --> 01:27:58.409
me a lollipop joint this whole thing I

01:27:58.409 --> 01:27:59.789
misinterpreted it you were like I

01:27:59.789 --> 01:28:01.079
usually suck on these for like two

01:28:01.079 --> 01:28:03.360
minutes and then I was like cool and I

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:03.959
walked away

01:28:03.959 --> 01:28:05.189
because I don't want to suck on

01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:06.809
something in front of everybody what

01:28:06.809 --> 01:28:08.909
else I was walking around like I don't

01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:10.439
know I did the dumbest man that ever in

01:28:10.439 --> 01:28:11.489
my I was like I think it takes me like

01:28:11.489 --> 01:28:13.110
four minutes you know Ollie pop so I'll

01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:15.119
probably eat half of this and I bit half

01:28:15.119 --> 01:28:17.899
of the lollipop

01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:25.260
[Laughter]

01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:36.429
yeah he's feeling good oh that was just

01:28:36.429 --> 01:28:38.170
the angle and the fact that he was right

01:28:38.170 --> 01:28:40.479
under the streetlight looks like he's

01:28:40.479 --> 01:28:48.610
being sent away to Space Camp anyway

01:28:48.610 --> 01:28:52.179
that lollipop got me so high I was yeah

01:28:52.179 --> 01:28:54.369
I got so high that I was questioning

01:28:54.369 --> 01:28:56.349
whether I even deserve to feel so good

01:28:56.349 --> 01:28:58.360
and now when I get high and I feel good

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.010
I'm like I gotta [ __ ] hang this up

01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:04.090
man oh this is really yeah no dude I've

01:29:04.090 --> 01:29:06.999
been going like I watched a video do

01:29:06.999 --> 01:29:09.929
ever watch school of life there youtubes

01:29:09.929 --> 01:29:14.019
no dude I have to I cannot hold the

01:29:14.019 --> 01:29:15.880
speed back you guys oh yeah hang in

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:27.130
there all right guys we were talking

01:29:27.130 --> 01:29:29.409
about before we take a break I thought

01:29:29.409 --> 01:29:35.590
you were recording I think before the

01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:37.300
break you know I'm looking at the other

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:38.380
files like I think we're talking about

01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:41.800
how so you were saying how you'll get

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.179
high and feel good and be like you need

01:29:43.179 --> 01:29:45.489
if you can't feel this good yeah every

01:29:45.489 --> 01:29:48.039
single at one time yeah not me dude I'll

01:29:48.039 --> 01:29:50.590
like while I watch this video on the

01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:53.440
school of life and it's like field it's

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.780
called it's like why you don't have to

01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:58.210
be spectacular okay talked about kids

01:29:58.210 --> 01:30:00.249
who grow up like said like 30 percent or

01:30:00.249 --> 01:30:02.440
you know whatever amount of kids grow up

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.530
where like they sense like a like unease

01:30:05.530 --> 01:30:07.150
extreme unease in their house or like

01:30:07.150 --> 01:30:09.099
severe frustration on inherence end and

01:30:09.099 --> 01:30:11.110
they get this message early on that they

01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:13.269
have to be like this spectacular success

01:30:13.269 --> 01:30:15.309
in order to justify their existence all

01:30:15.309 --> 01:30:16.239
right so I talked about people people

01:30:16.239 --> 01:30:17.769
get old and they wrestle with this weird

01:30:17.769 --> 01:30:19.630
thing of like there's a bunch of people

01:30:19.630 --> 01:30:20.889
were just like mill around and chill and

01:30:20.889 --> 01:30:22.059
are like cool to like do whatever

01:30:22.059 --> 01:30:23.559
there's a lot of times there's people

01:30:23.559 --> 01:30:25.179
who like feel as if they don't become

01:30:25.179 --> 01:30:27.519
like a mega sensation in some regard

01:30:27.519 --> 01:30:28.960
they're just inherently worthless and

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.360
can never fully chill

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:33.519
yeah that's maybe I feel like I have the

01:30:33.519 --> 01:30:35.619
[ __ ] sickness dude oh dude that's a

01:30:35.619 --> 01:30:37.570
dark place it's real dark places dark so

01:30:37.570 --> 01:30:39.159
I started I was watching this video and

01:30:39.159 --> 01:30:40.060
they were talking

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:42.880
about how the immensity of the perceived

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:44.920
immensity of that struggle is just as

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.300
intensive trying to live like a quiet

01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:47.890
normal life and that requires like the

01:30:47.890 --> 01:30:50.350
same exact intensity like there's a same

01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:51.790
exact intense moments but if your whole

01:30:51.790 --> 01:30:53.020
life is like if you're letting be quiet

01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:54.460
and humble enough it's just as intense

01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:56.770
it's on a different way yeah but either

01:30:56.770 --> 01:30:58.060
way I thought that was cool now I get

01:30:58.060 --> 01:30:59.200
high and I just think about how like

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.550
well you're the one that put me on to

01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:03.940
just loading up on like edibles and just

01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:06.490
like facing it um you'd step one so I've

01:31:06.490 --> 01:31:07.810
been I've been doing that I've been

01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:09.400
trying to undo the damage of that

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.740
lollipop with the exposure the [ __ ]

01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:13.300
weed exposure doesn't let the lollipop

01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:14.590
brought you to a bad spot you're saying

01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:16.300
yeah it took me I went too deep and I

01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:17.920
got stuck yeah that'll happen

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.930
so now but then you got the [ __ ]

01:31:19.930 --> 01:31:23.710
marker dozing tea it helps yeah do you

01:31:23.710 --> 01:31:24.970
think the lollipop after you had like

01:31:24.970 --> 01:31:26.470
after effects in terms of just was it

01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:28.750
after just higher or just in like it

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:32.620
happened in general what do you uh here

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:34.330
we get stoned I guess maybe you knew how

01:31:34.330 --> 01:31:35.980
stoned you could get and you're like I

01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:37.120
guess every time you got stoned you're

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:39.340
like oh no I hope I don't get that stuff

01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:42.010
maybe maybe I'm just like I'm afraid of

01:31:42.010 --> 01:31:43.420
getting that high I'm not actually

01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:45.790
feeling the the demons hundred

01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:47.380
milligrams is it [ __ ] that's down

01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:50.590
with the devil dude milligrams is like

01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:52.750
I've done that a couple of times on

01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:55.210
accident and it's always enjoyable

01:31:55.210 --> 01:31:58.300
enjoyable I'll like lay in bed though it

01:31:58.300 --> 01:31:59.500
was actually funny it happened to me

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:01.630
before I just like ate these cinnamon

01:32:01.630 --> 01:32:04.150
buns and laid in bed but we did know

01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:05.080
Matt no I didn't know how to like

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.190
measure it or anything with the middle

01:32:06.190 --> 01:32:08.200
grammage dude it was just all I would

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.970
close my eyes and all it was was Pangea

01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:12.040
like interlocking [ __ ] Pangea that's

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.690
all I could see for like hours and I

01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:16.150
just was like [ __ ] have to lay here

01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:17.530
dude I happened to be another time when

01:32:17.530 --> 01:32:19.840
I was in when I was like nine now about

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:22.420
like 21 I made I'm making like weed oil

01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:23.890
over the stove and I made it into

01:32:23.890 --> 01:32:25.570
brownies but I sat I had my face over

01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:26.620
and I've talked about this before in the

01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:28.480
podcast and I looked my face over of

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:30.280
that of boiling we Doyle and it will

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:32.110
read it all in for like 30 minutes then

01:32:32.110 --> 01:32:41.890
ate the brownies and I was like I ate a

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:43.450
brown I ate the brownie after like I'm

01:32:43.450 --> 01:32:45.550
sitting over at my face over it so my

01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:46.990
ate the brownie five minutes later I was

01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:52.750
super high and I was like I was a big

01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:56.980
I'd always be making it dude I like sat

01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:58.690
there and I was smoking it at the same

01:32:58.690 --> 01:33:02.890
time I sat there with my friend ate all

01:33:02.890 --> 01:33:05.230
the Browns I came to realize I was so

01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:06.910
high I fully realized that I was an

01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:09.040
animal and like fully accepted the fact

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:10.300
and it was the most like uncomfortable

01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:12.940
two weeks of my life

01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:14.770
was the night I laid in bed a whole

01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:16.330
night me and my friends were sitting

01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:17.740
watching TV and I just felt like we were

01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:20.580
like birds on a branch I was just like

01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:23.020
this is what birds do like gonna sit

01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:25.960
here one morning we rode only walk on

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:26.560
all fours

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.710
that was pretty grim it was like a real

01:33:29.710 --> 01:33:31.120
thing I just sit with being an animal

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:33.430
and like fully accepted in fact still

01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:35.200
freaks me out to think about that you're

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:42.910
an animal yeah I'm thinking about some

01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:44.380
of my favorite things about being a

01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:46.720
human no one I'm an animal really yeah

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:48.400
freak me out dude I love thinking about

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:50.620
like like the time period when people

01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:52.600
were basically just barely not animals

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.520
anymore that's funny [ __ ] because that's

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.380
what I always think about like the

01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.270
earliest dumbest human inventing

01:33:58.270 --> 01:34:00.130
something you already mean like you're

01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:02.110

the sky now this is gonna be magnified

01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:20.630

comfortably do it yeah really yeah just

01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:04.910
go back why I would think being around

01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:10.210
kids and being stoned would be fun I

01:40:10.210 --> 01:40:12.650
probably shouldn't do it all the time of

01:40:12.650 --> 01:40:14.210
course not because it's like guys can't

01:40:14.210 --> 01:40:15.230
do anything all the time around your

01:40:15.230 --> 01:40:17.000

01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:40.820
patience and sure I don't I don't think

01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:42.650
there's anything like inherently it's

01:40:42.650 --> 01:40:44.990
probably a good thing to do I've done

01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:48.530
the research it's good yeah exactly

01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:50.810
yeah double-blind over here yeah like a

01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:51.980

humans trying to figure out the world

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.160
yeah right so it makes you really

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:08.450
patient with what they're doing because

01:41:08.450 --> 01:41:10.730
you have to like in in in the forefront

01:41:10.730 --> 01:41:11.690
of your mind especially if you're high

01:41:11.690 --> 01:41:14.180
it's like I definitely went through a

01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:16.090
figuring out process similar to this Wow

01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:18.200
imagine if somebody would have been

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.190
there to just like

01:41:19.190 --> 01:41:22.580

use a normal voice in a supermarket

01:41:50.770 --> 01:41:59.160
[Laughter]

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:02.610
three kids

01:42:05.489 --> 01:42:07.960

with their family as a serial killer

01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:24.010
sure it should be tedious and hard

01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:26.260
because all you're doing is like prop

01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:27.520

01:42:43.090 --> 01:42:45.039
that I mean no but there's also like I

01:42:45.039 --> 01:42:47.110
feel like - we have the kind of kids

01:42:47.110 --> 01:42:49.449
that once they get rolling like

01:42:49.449 --> 01:42:51.670

01:42:51.670 --> 01:42:53.530
I can't like kind of back off a little

01:42:53.530 --> 01:42:54.789
bit when you get off the cruising speed

01:42:54.789 --> 01:42:58.750

my day and somehow before I got back my

01:43:05.829 --> 01:43:07.539
mom would have found out what I did that

01:43:07.539 --> 01:43:10.270

01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:19.000
and my well here's the thing my parents

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.170

just like walk around the neighborhood

01:43:39.250 --> 01:43:42.099
and not be in church that's all the plan

01:43:42.099 --> 01:43:44.710
was I think we like showed up like we

01:43:44.710 --> 01:43:45.880
