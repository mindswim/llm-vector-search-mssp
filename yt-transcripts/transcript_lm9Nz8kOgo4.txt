00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.280
excitement in the entire card that was

little kid game though the bus and the

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.880
button smashing game it's not bad

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.400
information dude

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.080
buttons i'm like i'm analyzing i hear

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.520
that

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.919
that's just lightning fast combos all

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.520
right call it what you want

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.319
you weren't fast enough

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.000
yeah lemaire was definitely testing

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.919
certain aspects of my game but yeah i

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.199
def you know i think i haven't figured

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:29.440
out

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.800
he also again he's playing his level

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.919
boss he's like being goro in the

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.080
original yeah the mayor plays as devorah

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.840
lemaire plays as a girl in a video game

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.440
which is uh perverted

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.960
it is sick matt brought up a very good

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.039
point it's the best move

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:42.960
it's very sick and perverted no it's the

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.319
best move there's always the problem is

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.000
you get like a strong heterosexual like

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.400
me

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.680
i'm checking the girl out the whole yeah

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.520
i can't fight it's not a fair fight

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.479
i'm like i don't want her i'm a

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.599
christian obviously i don't want to hit

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.560
her

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.680
even if it's a bug lady yes

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.280
i'm a christian i'm heterosexual i don't

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.880
want to hit her

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.720
yeah i don't know you can't i never i

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.000
always hated

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.720
if you play as a chick in a game it goes

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.400
against me dude goes against everything

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.120
in my soul

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.680
true why because it's for girls dude

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.280
what do you mean like anybody that plays

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.880
is like you probably plays peach

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.360
and no you definitely play as princess

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.479
peach

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:19.520

tony who tony soprano in today's climate

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.560

because they're like well the mob's cool

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.839
so you guys can be racist

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:17.680

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.200
mob's cool so

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.120

great doctor nick cannon

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:30.560
true us whites neanderthals very pale

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.240
pink boys neanderthals dudes we're

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:32.959
pretty much

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:35.120
the closest thing to animals as nick

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.399
cannon would say

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:38.480
honestly on a podcast what's his new

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.600
yo you know what was really interesting

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.600
now that i'm on this [ __ ] race kick

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.839
yeah it was really fun to see the way uh

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:56.160
all the analysts on espn handled desean

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.519
jackson

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:01.440
quoting hitler versus the way they

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.200
treated drew brees who was like i don't

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.480
know i think he should stand during the

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.680
end

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.600
it's [ __ ] crazy yeah what was the how

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.279
did they play out to sean jackson

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:11.040
were they every analyst was like yo i

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.640
talked to deesh

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.640
he you know he was trying to lift people

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.000
up

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.720
so he was trying to just worded it wrong

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.920
he was just trying to lift people up

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.959
it's like dude he quoted

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:23.360
say check his bibliography bro hitler

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.399
well if you know yeah i guess you had to

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:25.519
quote hitler right

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:27.360
or he should have been like guys i know

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.519
and he he actually misquoted hitler

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:31.200
what he said he attributed a quote to

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.120
hitler that wasn't even

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.680
hitler so everybody was wrong yeah i

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.360
mean he literally posted a paragraph

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.959
that said hitler said

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:40.560
it just turned out it was wrong so

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.000
people were like it wasn't actually

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.600
hitler that's not true

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.920
who was i don't know it was weird he

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.600
thought he was quoting hitler you tried

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.200
to quote hitler in a good way

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.640
yeah he tried to be like hitler was

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.839
right that the jews were trying to

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:54.000
extort america

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.160
but posted that online yeah the quote

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.399
i've seen the quote itself was

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:00.160
about i think like one of the prime

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.320
ministers of israel saying we're going

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.320
to like bleed america dry

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.920
and just toss it to the side when we're

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.600
done with it or something and he was

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.320
like

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.640
it's probably hitler hitler said yeah

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.519
that sounds like

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:14.640
sounds like the big man but it is

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.360
it is really fun to go back and watch uh

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.440
watch how they handle drew brees being

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.640
like

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.399
i like the fight it's like i like

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:24.079
america

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:25.440
they're like piece of [ __ ] get them out

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.959
of the league it's time to retire desean

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:28.880
jackson was like yo hitler

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.560
they had some decent points and they

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.720
were like my man's just misunderstood

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.839
right now

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:36.160
it's like damn all right espn well nick

weirdly enough last week i did

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:46.640
researching in the canon yeah he has

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.160

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:52.560
g's of water dude probably

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.880
having to piss every like five minutes

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.079
he's like yeah you got to see the thing

he uh i believe i could be wrong i

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.200

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.839
uh so nick cannon is kind of the man he

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:14.720
rules like to see

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.399

out no way if you got on there and

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.839

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:33.920
been the best vlog

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.440

eminem basically eminem left the battle

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.920
because there's too much ken the cannon

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.880
was bringing too much heat

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.480
true then he started a black racist

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.040
podcast which is power move

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.519
sick technically we are allied with yes

00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:11.680
we are allies of black conservatives

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.519
and we agree with almost everything they

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:15.519
say except when it comes to the fact

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:18.160
that you and me are some human

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.880
but i'll give them dude i'll fully own

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.200
my

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.120
neanderthal blood dude it is true like

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.240
when he's saying to you like that i do

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.839
have to analyze how i behave

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:27.760
yeah or be like i am coming from a place

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.839
of abundance because of the ice age 15

00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:32.270
000 years ago

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.079
[Laughter]

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:36.720
well dude brett weinstein just had a uh

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.240
like a round table discussion

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.079
with like not all but primarily

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:43.760
black in a like black conservative

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.839
intellectuals from like colleges

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:46.959
it was sick but there was a couple you

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:47.920
know there's a couple people who were

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.600
more like like left center or whatever

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.160
yeah but he uh it was funny because he

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.320
had this podcast where it's just him

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.000
and nothing but like black intellectuals

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.279
and he's like all right guys something

00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:58.639
weird about this let's uh let's talk

00:13:58.639 --> 00:13:58.930
race

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.560
[Laughter]

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.839
you can't throw like two other white

00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:03.440
people in there to not make it look like

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.800
completely bizarre

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.480
but it was funny man it was like good

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.839
for them booking it like a [ __ ]

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:08.720
two-ray show

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.800
yeah yes he had to come out and be like

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.079
what's up white people

00:14:12.079 --> 00:14:13.470
i'm just playing yo

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.870
[Laughter]

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:22.800
daddies and then hosted warm daddies

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.160
it'd be like what the [ __ ] are you doing

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.040
that's true

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.399
and then he you know he started talking

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:28.160
like uh there was one

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.000
one point he was saying something like

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.519
you know like we can't

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:32.720
it was something about like making

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.720
excuses for people who are you he's

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.240
basically saying like crime is just from

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.120
deprivation and

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.800
it's a it's a you know normal response

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.160
and then someone

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.760
he kept alluding to the fact that people

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.959
were it's like the real problem here

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:44.079
it's not racial

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:45.440
it's he's like there is a racial problem

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.880
but the real problem is the fact that

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.920
there is people who are

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.600
hoarding opportunity he was saying rent

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.839
seekers so weinstein was like he was

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:52.320
like there's

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.680
rent seekers which i still want to

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.120
figure out what the [ __ ] that is i just

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.560
thought that was like like a sneaky way

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.360
to say jews

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.800
like definitely i didn't know what that

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.079
was rent secretary he started saying

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:01.519
what rent sneakers i'm like i guess you

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:02.320
can say that

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.399
because weinstein's jewish so he started

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:05.680
saying then people started like bringing

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.480
up stuff like what

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.240
you if you say like you know i don't it

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.440
was just funny they brought up his

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.040
that's his globalist black conservatives

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.000
their achilles heel

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.519
is they kind of all hate jews a little

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:15.360
bit so like they they started going into

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.800
that territory and why she was like no

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.279
no no

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:18.480
jews have been attacked for a thousand

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.320
years it was funny

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.519
yeah i saw uh the jews got on desean a

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:24.560
little bit did they

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.160

he wrote a scathing article about sean

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:35.759
jackson yeah basically again being like

00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:36.399
yo

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.600

in this together yeah he was just well

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.560
actually he was a little aggressive

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.680
about it he was like you want to talk

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.720
oppression

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.240
we've been oppressed since the beginning

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.320
of time

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.560

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.480
it was just kind of awkward it was a

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.480
weird it's a weird dynamic because he

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.079
was like it was just him at the top

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:16.800

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.440
friction here and there

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.360

place

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.720

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.960
besides golf

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.919
like you could be at your friend's

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:48.480

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.960
sport for somebody to sit and watch to

00:24:43.679 --> 00:24:44.799
was the uh

00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:46.000
well that was the issue when i was

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.760
watching the uh the black intellectual

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.279
roundtable featuring brett weinstein

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:53.360
that's so [ __ ] weird but they were

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.720
arguing about structural

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.640
like systemic racism and like all that

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.640
stuff and you know

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.159
i was it's like you know both things but

00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:01.120
you'll bring it up to people and they're

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.400
like oh it's [ __ ] [ __ ] and it's

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.039
like

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:04.799
okay you know you can make the cultural

00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:06.159
arguments but then it's like then

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:06.880
there's like

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.360
night you know as recent as like 1995

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.720
early 2000s

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.400
there was a huge portion of america

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.320
where like say a white trick white chick

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.840
brings home a black boyfriend it's a

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.200
[ __ ] situation

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.080
like that that was a reality that is

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.360
like people don't it's not like a

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.120
serious deal now but like that was a

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.720
serious reality up until like

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.880
maybe like eminem i think eminem might

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.240
have allowed black dudes to go home with

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:28.880
white shakes

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.480
[Laughter]

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.720
yeah i'd say i'd say more recent than

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.840
that i'd say

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.039
depending where you're at now i'm

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:37.039
talking large swaths of america

00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:38.400
that is like and that's like a thing

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.000
anyone can no one can deny that everyone

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.120
can be like well the job number's blah

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.000
blah blah sure

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.840
but if you think that doesn't affect

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.840
like upper management positions where

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.320
it's like

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.520
i wouldn't let you date my daughter but

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.440
god damn it i want you to be the ceo

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.200
yeah they're mutually exclusive but

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.960
they're not like so yeah that was funny

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.080
watching people argue about that where

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:54.880
people will be like

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.480
it's not real there's no it's like

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.159
there's yeah there's a little there's

00:25:58.159 --> 00:25:59.679
there's stuff in there dude of being

00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:00.080
like

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.360
that would have been again that country

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.360
club would have been like you hear his

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.400
daughter's dating black guy they were

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.720
like what everybody said shut the [ __ ]

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.679
up dude i'm doing my backswing

00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:11.039
yeah so that was an argument i took away

00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:12.559
from the black intellectual roundtable

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:14.080
but i was you gotta you gotta include

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:14.960
though

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.799
now i hear you where it separates is

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:19.360
white people are the ones hiring

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.840
the jobs but being a white dude going

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.320
into a black relationship it's equally

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.720
damaging you know what i mean what do

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.520
you mean like like

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.279
if you're the only one who's the parents

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:30.799
thing you're saying yeah future national

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:31.600
coacher

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.679
yes yeah i mean it's i mean it's there

00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:34.640
no matter what

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.559
that's exclusive for sure it's not

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:38.000
exclusive to the honks but what

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.720
is it for sure job market yeah that's

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.080
where things get weird well i mean i

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.840
look i've occupied i've been asked

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.520
i've actually pushed it out a lot you

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.960
know you do that and it's like

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.000
yeah there's just people who aren't

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.520
happy to see you at all you go there and

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.400
they're just like

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.080
[ __ ] man i've gone into black church and

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.159
you can tell they're just kind of like

00:26:54.159 --> 00:26:55.440
like it's like doing stand-up and you

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.960
like see like an old dude come here like

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.600
oh i can't

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.880
i can't talk about this there's an old

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.159
person here they're probably like going

00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:01.279
through their head like well there goes

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:02.799
that there goes that i'm not talking

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:04.240
about that anymore

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.520
but yeah it was just it was just funny

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.919
man it was uh i don't know i i think

00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:09.520
we're struggling right now for

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.840
right now there's like no ideological

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.279
system that really serves

00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:14.240
people in a way that's kind of

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.200
meaningful right now i think we're

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.880
struggling to come up with a new one

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.799
so that's that's the battle yeah like

00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:20.159
systemic this is like

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:21.679
what about the crime statistics in it

00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:23.360
it's just like i found some meaning

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.679
i started betting oh there you go big

00:27:25.679 --> 00:27:26.799
into gambling that's fun

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.640
are you really yeah dude put a lot put a

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.039
ton of money on orlando

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:34.640
versus miami in mls got the w

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.320
did you really big win and then uh

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.559
immediately the interlock squandered it

00:27:38.559 --> 00:27:41.840
over the week so you won game one

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.960
big early and then literally up until

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.679
last night

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:47.919
was just blowing through it i how much

00:27:47.919 --> 00:27:50.159
you win i won like 350

00:27:50.159 --> 00:27:54.559
and then my ufc i can't

00:27:54.559 --> 00:27:57.760
yeah i can't bet i'm one for like nine

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.320
bets in the last two ufc events really

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.279
it's it's

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:03.600
almost impressive how badly i lose and

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.480
loser

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.200
losing the ufc bet [ __ ] blows dude

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:07.840
why

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.000
because your guy just gets the [ __ ] beat

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.039
out of him the whole time

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:13.120
you just watch him beat your 350 out of

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.240
the guy he's like there's 25

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.520
and like just when it's like a

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.279
dominating fight like uh

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:21.760
maz vidal fought usman uzman's this

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.200
nigerian like wrestler

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.200
yeah and he's nasty i mean he's he's

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.279
like the best and mosbital

00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:28.720
i was like hoping he could land like a

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.080
knockout or something he took the fight

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.360
on like one week

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.799
he was just an underdog so i was like

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:34.399
[ __ ] yeah a hundred bucks on mazda

00:28:34.399 --> 00:28:37.279
let's go and he just got like did you

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:38.720
did you watch uh

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.440
khabib versus conor mcgregor i saw parts

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:41.760
of it

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.600
just yeah yeah that's all it was

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.600
gusman just like grabbed him and stomped

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.720
on his foot

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.480
every single round that's just toasty

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.240
fights like my dad he hugged him against

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.279
the cage

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:55.120
yeah to my dad exactly so he [ __ ]

right now to

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.519
legalize growing so you know they do the

00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:44.000
medical

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.159
thing in pennsylvania right now so it's

00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:47.360
like basically you need i think i said

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.720
this you need 250 000

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.919
just to apply and then you need to have

00:31:49.919 --> 00:31:52.000
like an indoor warehouse all this stuff

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.840
what i'm trying to do and i think this

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.760
is the time to do it right now

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.919
is start pressuring local people and

00:31:57.919 --> 00:31:58.960
saying like look

00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.919
so right now we're gonna have an

00:31:59.919 --> 00:32:01.120
economic downturn they always do this

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.480
they're like oh the state needs money

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.000
the state needs money so we're gonna

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.880
just do this

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.960
let five people do it tax them and let

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.320
five people get rich it's like

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.399
why not do micro permits let like

00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:12.080
everyone grow 20 to 50 plants who can

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.440
apply for like a couple hundred dollar

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.000
permit

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.360
and then you go to the dispensary and

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.360
now there's like hundreds of brands that

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.799
are in kind of limited supply so it's

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:20.240
like you know i'd have a brand obviously

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.919
matt and shane's secret podcast coach

00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:23.279
that would be out in the dispensary you

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:24.880
could have a secret podcast secret

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.399
podcast then you could have like

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:27.600
so you have a bunch of people where like

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.760
the dispensary now is going right to the

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.240
money

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.760
right going to like you know smaller

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.440
kind of businesses rather than five big

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.880
companies that are already established

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.159
in colorado who are like

00:32:36.159 --> 00:32:37.360
well we have the money we'll just come

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.799
over to pennsylvania monopolize the

00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:39.679
whole weed market

00:32:39.679 --> 00:32:41.120
then the state gets paid off of it but

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.720
it's like you could let the people who

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.159
live here get paid off of it

00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:46.000
tax their money the state would still

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.440
get it cut and then all the citizens

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:47.760
here

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.120
would be getting a ton of money off the

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.039
weed profit i don't see why

00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:52.799
it's [ __ ] [ __ ] i don't see how

00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:53.600
they don't do it so i'm gonna start

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.559
pressuring local

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:55.840
representatives and so i'm gonna start

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.039
doing my thing i was doing when i do the

00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:58.159
journalist thing where i call them like

00:32:58.159 --> 00:32:59.120
just let you know those calls being

00:32:59.120 --> 00:32:59.919
recorded

00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:02.080
and to start talking right and just just

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.919
absolutely clobber them

00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:04.960
like there's no reason why they

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:05.919
shouldn't do this and they're like what

00:33:05.919 --> 00:33:07.200
about the black market it's like well it

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.399
eliminates a black market

00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:09.840
do you let everyone participate in

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.360
growing and selling marijuana the black

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.799
market [ __ ] goes away

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:13.840
it's like why would you take the risk

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.760
when you can just do that legally you

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.080
know

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.840
you tell me dude i'm telling you dude

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.960
i'm gonna i might get into local

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.480
politics just be warned

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.840
just be warned i hope you get

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.880
assassinated

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.760
i hope you're running for like alderman

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.840
and get shot in the head

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.519
i'm gonna get assassinated by cresco

00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:33.440
labs they might hot shot me

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.960
they might send they might give me some

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.880
sort of like i don't know maybe some

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.080
like tangio g

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.840
it's [ __ ] dusted with fentanyl and i

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.080
[ __ ] go down i could it's possible

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.320
i i hope fresco or terrapin could take

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.840
me down

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.760
are those the weed are those the big is

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.840
that big wheat fresco ailera

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.360
standard farms i kind of like them

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.880
terrapin not bad either

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.720
good i've talked to them before i call

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.320
them i kind of i call these companies

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.679
and bug them i'm like what do you put on

00:33:57.679 --> 00:33:58.799
this you actually watch this do you do

00:33:58.799 --> 00:33:59.679
this

00:33:59.679 --> 00:34:01.600
why i mean i just kind of i think it's

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.640
[ __ ] that there's only five

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.080
companies it's like so

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.000
in order to grow weed now you have to

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.720
it's it's illegal unless you're

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.399
incredibly wealthy then it's just like

00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:12.159
all the people who are in jail for it

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:13.359
they're still in jail but if you have a

00:34:13.359 --> 00:34:15.440
ton of money you're allowed to do it and

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.399
the uh yeah so just [ __ ] and they

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:19.760
like so it's like i could sit here and

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.960
use they're like well you need all this

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.159
capital to start up it's like yeah

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.760
because you guys only do indoor growth

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.040
so it's like

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.440
i have the sun i can grow weed i can put

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.119
this in dirt and it'll literally just

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:30.480
sprout up you know you do a little bit

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.520
of work but

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.879

00:46:47.599 --> 00:46:50.240
on um well we've been having a classic

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.920
power struggle which is it's been going

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:52.720
pretty well

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.160
dude i've gotten really good at um

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.680
somewhere right now i've been working on

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.440
this whole idea of just like

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.599
combating non-biological fear and just

00:47:01.599 --> 00:47:03.280
like not giving things that aren't

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.640
biologically based any sort of

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.839
biological attention

00:47:05.839 --> 00:47:08.079
so like base like if something like if

00:47:08.079 --> 00:47:09.119
like someone

00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:10.720
sent you a split dog someone's only

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.319
split that's that that would trigger

00:47:12.319 --> 00:47:14.000
your biological systems i'm talking more

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.680
about like uh i mean but yeah it's not a

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:15.920
bi

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.520
it's not a real biological threat so

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.960
it's like i i whenever something happens

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.319
that disturbs me

00:47:20.319 --> 00:47:22.800
i tr i try it's really blowing his nose

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.160
really loud damn i tried

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.520
more modes down on the bullpen they're

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.800

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:27.280
to go

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.720
i always try to think i'm like is this

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.400
an actual biological threat if it's not

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.920
a biological threat it doesn't require a

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.599
biological response on my part

00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:35.280
so when basement she'll start hitting me

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.800
like dude we've been

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.559
she i mean it's a classic conundrum that

00:47:38.559 --> 00:47:39.839
whole toilet seat thing

00:47:39.839 --> 00:47:41.359
where it's like it's just in theory it

00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:42.559
just doesn't check out it's like all

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:42.880
right

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.640
i'm going to lift it up so i don't pee

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:45.920
all over it for you and

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.200
for you and then it's going to be clean

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.359
enough for you to just simply lower it

00:47:49.359 --> 00:47:50.960
i think i have a theory this is kind of

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.880
freudian but i think when women have to

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.000
lower the seat

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.240
you're triggering like freud like tina's

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.640
envy i think they're being like

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.079
i can't just i even have an extra

00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:02.160
contraption because of my sub

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.160
you know my my inferior i'm laughing

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.240
yeah i'm lacking my body sucks yeah

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.440
i'm lacking so i think because i was

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.599
like look it's i'm lifting it up

00:48:09.599 --> 00:48:11.280
and you know in definition if i remember

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.880
to put it down i will but you can't

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.960
freak out if it's up because it's like i

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.319
moved it up so there's no p

00:48:16.319 --> 00:48:18.640
on it for sure all you have to do is

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.480
just simply drop it dude she'll

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.839
i'll hear it from the basement it'll

00:48:21.839 --> 00:48:24.400
just slam down and it's just like

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.920
what is the what's the base what's the

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.839
rationale and then i'm sorry we'll be

00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:28.480
talking

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.920
we'll be talking and then it'll be like

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.680
you know she's like well you know i had

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.640
the kid more it's like

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.079
dude i hear you you know i'm working

00:48:34.079 --> 00:48:35.839
full time and

00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:37.760
she needs your boobs to eat i i can't

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.599
feed i don't have i don't produce milk

00:48:39.599 --> 00:48:40.880
that's [ __ ] just because i'm a woman

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.000
it's like look if you wanna you want

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.440
that all the way

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.040
don't be slamming that it's such

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.880
[ __ ] stuff but it's like there's no

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.319
reason that that should be a thing that

00:48:48.319 --> 00:48:49.680
all women are just like

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.599
yeah like you we that's ridiculous you

00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:53.760
don't think women should nitpick

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.200
yeah i don't understand what the sea

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.480
thing is i can't even imagine why they

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:56.800
would

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.960
pick something so that's what i'm saying

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.319
insignificant to try to fight

00:49:00.319 --> 00:49:02.559
2020 in this political climate i mean as

00:49:02.559 --> 00:49:04.319
powerful and kick-ass as women are a

00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:06.160
toilet seat pretty much tends to always

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:06.880
defeat them

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:07.920
i don't know you don't understand

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.680
they're usually so unstoppable and kick

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.480
ass

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.440
dude i mean they're [ __ ] they're

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.480
hitting it they're going they're all the

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.400
power and the toilet seats left up and

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.440
they're like oh my day is ruined

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.760
i i can't understand dude i dump in

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.960
truck stops

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.280
damn consistently sure i don't want to

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.200
hear it about one toilet seat being left

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.160
up that's what i'm saying

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.440
it's like have you guys ever been in him

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.319

what is this hang up here there's no pee

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.160

you gotta you have no problem lifting

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.680

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.040
where i just like i leave it up all the

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:45.839
time because i'll do it

00:49:45.839 --> 00:49:46.800
i'm like i'm not using this one i'm

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.599

no problem and it's like

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.640
what what is this what is this symbolic

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.160
battle we're having it's like you know

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:54.559
so

00:49:54.559 --> 00:49:56.319
we the power struggle has been nice but

00:49:56.319 --> 00:49:57.680
the whole moral of the story is i've

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.720
gotten really good at when i get

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.079

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.079
i'm gonna start telling people we'll be

00:53:18.079 --> 00:53:19.520
like dude he's so crazy things we all

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.400
want to [ __ ] our dad

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.839
or moms and people like yeah i know like

00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:23.599
i always wanted to [ __ ] my dad i was one

00:53:23.599 --> 00:53:24.319
of my dad

00:53:24.319 --> 00:53:26.559
i sort of bone my dad well that is

00:53:26.559 --> 00:53:28.000
that's the uh that's the theory

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.440
that you want to bone your mom but the

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.960
price you pay if you're going to try to

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.240
bone your mom your dad's going to catch

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.359
you and cut your dog off

00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:36.559
yeah i don't know worth it i mean

00:53:36.559 --> 00:53:40.839
yeah would you risk it if six-year-old

00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:42.400
you

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.680
that's a sick theory that the fact that

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.040
a bunch of scientists in vienna in like

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.119
1907 were like

00:53:47.119 --> 00:53:48.880
it chuck's out yeah pretty good damn

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.880
freud must have been like a bully

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.640
yeah he had everybody in the room be

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.559
like he's like you want to [ __ ] your mom

00:53:54.559 --> 00:53:55.359
right and were like

00:53:55.359 --> 00:53:58.640
yes dr freud yes doctor he was he was a

00:53:58.640 --> 00:53:59.280
bully

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:01.280
he had to be bullied if you if you

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.119
convinced a room full of grown men to be

00:54:03.119 --> 00:54:03.760
like

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:05.440
i believe the theory that we all want to

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.960
[ __ ] our moms and we're afraid our dad's

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.240
going to cut our dick off

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.920
that's that's his classic critique that

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.280
people were like i don't like

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.440
his he had young he had he had a bunch

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.400
of these dudes who were like at his

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.760
disposal he's like you guys are going to

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.839
carry my legacy and they were like

00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:18.880
i don't think this is all about like

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.240
coming near our mom and he's like

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.839
nonsense and he'd pass out

00:54:21.839 --> 00:54:24.960
he used to faint a lot good yeah i'm not

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.319
a fan dude a freud

00:54:26.319 --> 00:54:27.680
i don't like that that's it it was

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.640
interesting it's just a wrong theory

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.079
he got a lot of other stuff right he got

00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:33.760
a lot of stuff like really

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.520
i know he did before he's like the

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.200
father of it yeah pretty much

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.200
um but that was one he wouldn't like

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.440
they were like just let that one go dude

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.880
like [ __ ] it i'm all in so yeah

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.880
i kind of respect that they're like dude

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.240
all of your stuff's revolutionary just

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.000
let this one but when i was a kid i did

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.040
love my mom

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:54.240
really yeah that's the thing too i was a

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.280
little kid i like

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.079
loved my mom yeah your dad noticed he

00:54:58.079 --> 00:54:58.480
probably

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.240
yeah he was probably like strong it's

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.559
like easy if i could give you a

00:55:02.559 --> 00:55:05.920
quick [ __ ] dick like a kindergartner

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.640
[ __ ]

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.160
[ __ ] pervert oh yeah um but now no i

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.839
wouldn't i mean i'd miss

00:55:11.839 --> 00:55:13.599
hand stuff maybe yeah that's where

00:55:13.599 --> 00:55:16.000
you're standing

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.160
but no i wouldn't [ __ ] it up i don't

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.599
think i would shane do people want to

00:55:19.599 --> 00:55:21.440
update on the kleenex situation at your

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:21.920
house

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.640
kleenex situation is unchanged however i

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.040
have

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.559
switched tactics now that it's been

00:55:26.559 --> 00:55:28.160
brought up by so many people and i've

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.359
been critiqued

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:32.640
also my uh my jerking off has

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:36.319
slowed down quite a bit really yeah just

00:55:36.319 --> 00:55:39.040
i wasn't home for like two or three days

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:39.599
so the

00:55:39.599 --> 00:55:41.119
it's been a week since we discussed it

00:55:41.119 --> 00:55:43.520
tissues the tissues haven't been touched

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.000
since my secret mission to throw five

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.440
tissues in an old box

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.119
tissues have not been used once you've

00:55:51.119 --> 00:55:52.559
been easy on them i've been taking it

00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:53.119
easy on

00:55:53.119 --> 00:55:54.480
nice yeah i've been giving the kleenex a

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.880
little break is that it where are we at

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.359

are you are you familiar with the

00:56:19.359 --> 00:56:20.720
anti-pet movement

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.880
anti-pet movement yeah i was just

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.400
thinking about it the other day

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.799

dog

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.359
yeah they're that's too many pets that's

00:56:31.359 --> 00:56:32.880
something you can out that's like the

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.480
the new wave of woke you can get on if

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.160
you want to be on like the early early

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.200
train where like you can

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.200
tell people that like owning a pet is

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.119
[ __ ] up and that like you're like

00:56:41.119 --> 00:56:42.319
you know you're telling it when they can

00:56:42.319 --> 00:56:44.160
eat tell anyone i can go outside and in

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.440
reality this is what this one i was

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.559
reading this one dude's blog he's a

00:56:46.559 --> 00:56:47.520
vegan as well

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.720
he was saying that like he's like you

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.559
know i have a couple rescue animals but

00:56:50.559 --> 00:56:51.760
at the end of the day if there was two

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.440
dogs left in the universe

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.880
i wouldn't you know i wouldn't i'd let

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.799
dogs get be extinct before i kept them

00:56:56.799 --> 00:56:57.520
as pets

00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.200
he's like that's how strongly i feel so

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.319
there's there's a movement called you

00:57:00.319 --> 00:57:01.599
can start calling people out like it's

00:57:01.599 --> 00:57:03.760
kind of [ __ ] up you own an animal but

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.079
pretty tight i might get on that that's

00:57:06.079 --> 00:57:07.680
good it's kind of [ __ ] up i like that

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.599
i like that you jump to

00:57:09.599 --> 00:57:11.040
like the mo like instead of just like

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.640
going vegan

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.160
being like i think you know factory

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.359
farming's [ __ ] up you're just like

00:57:15.359 --> 00:57:15.760
dude

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.160
pet having a pet is slavery literally

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.440
that's kind of [ __ ] up that's kind of

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.559
what they're saying they're like we are

00:57:20.559 --> 00:57:22.240
just in like a dark age where we don't

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.440
realize what we're doing but like the

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.640
fact that

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.599
we're just like like having and housing

00:57:27.599 --> 00:57:28.000
dogs

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.400
like we you it like destroys them as

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.280
animals and

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.559
there is science behind like

00:57:32.559 --> 00:57:33.920
domestication like what does that

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.160
absolutely destroys animals like it

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.520
had this thought yesterday did you

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.440
really i was i went over to

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:42.960
uh fart maguire's to do peloton perfect

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.880
and uh when i got done i was just

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.960
sitting there looking at riggins

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.119
he's a big dog just he just sits in the

00:57:49.119 --> 00:57:50.079
living room all day

00:57:50.079 --> 00:57:53.599
yeah he just sits there he breathes hard

00:57:53.599 --> 00:57:54.400
constantly

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.760
he just said i was like damn dude this

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.480
is his but he's a dog

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.480
it's a good life dude that's the thing

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.520
too like if there were

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.200
two dogs in an air-conditioned living

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.559
room

00:58:04.559 --> 00:58:05.920
and then occasionally someone throws

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.599
tennis balls

00:58:07.599 --> 00:58:09.520
he's chilling that's what that's a dog's

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.200
he's happy yeah i don't think yeah he

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.960
doesn't want to be on the woods foraging

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.640
it's kind of a non-starter yeah i mean

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:15.839
it is glorious for them to be able to

00:58:15.839 --> 00:58:16.960
run around like that

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.040
yeah he's got a big-ass yard he goes and

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.319
it's a hot take a big look if there's

00:58:20.319 --> 00:58:21.359
two dogs left

00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:23.119
i'm not breeding them it's like you're

00:58:23.119 --> 00:58:25.040
like dogs become extinct

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.720
it's like i'm a vegan bro what do you

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.079
want me to do

00:58:28.079 --> 00:58:30.720
but they're just such a weird flame but

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:31.440
they're uh

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:33.119
they've done study produced on studies

00:58:33.119 --> 00:58:34.480
on chickens because they're trying to

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.680
figure out how they chickens are having

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.000
a rough

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.680
time chickens are having a having a

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.359
negative experience well so this is what

00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:40.880
they try to figure out they're like look

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:41.920
because they're they were trying to like

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:42.960
you know this comes from like they're

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.200
not being enough food but they're like

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.799
well if we you know eventually they

00:58:46.799 --> 00:58:47.920
started making tons of profit but

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.119
they're like

00:58:49.119 --> 00:58:50.640
we can take so you study chickens you

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:51.920
track how many eggs they lay so you're

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.359
like you would think in theory

00:58:53.359 --> 00:58:55.920
if you take all the top layers like all

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.520
the hens that lay the most and put them

00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.119
together like a little like box they put

00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:01.040
them in they would then

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:04.000
put a tent in the box if you put them

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:04.960
all in a box

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.640
you would think if you screened out the

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.480
top layers and just let the other like

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:10.160
oddballs that just lay like one egg a

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.599
day or like one every three days those

00:59:11.599 --> 00:59:12.079
losers

00:59:12.079 --> 00:59:14.240
all those losers die off then like you

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.920
would do so they did an experiment where

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.720
they'd have like

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.119
top layer medium layer for the eggs and

00:59:19.119 --> 00:59:20.799
like just like a total oddball like some

00:59:20.799 --> 00:59:21.920
of them didn't even lay eggs they were

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:23.280
just kind of like just be there freaks

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.680
[ __ ] weirdos losers and then you do

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.200
nothing but top producers

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.319
the ones with the like differing like

00:59:30.319 --> 00:59:32.240
layers of hens actually still let's

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.359
somehow produce more

00:59:33.359 --> 00:59:35.440
eggs than like just nothing but top dog

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.440
hens who lay more a day

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.559
so there's something there's some

00:59:38.559 --> 00:59:40.960
function of a hen who doesn't lay any

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.720
eggs plays a weird function in chicken

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:43.359
world

00:59:43.359 --> 00:59:44.960
so when you try to like mechanize nature

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.000
too much they're saying like it actually

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:46.559
works yeah

00:59:46.559 --> 00:59:47.760
so they have to like let lose their

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.839
hands live in like their little three by

00:59:49.839 --> 00:59:51.440
five sales which is pretty [ __ ] funny

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.640
dude

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.760
i i the first night in the poconos they

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.520
ordered wings

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.720
i had 25 wings yeah

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.599
probably roughly it's like 12 chickens

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:05.440
it's crazy

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.079
it's crazy every time i every time i eat

01:00:08.079 --> 01:00:09.359
a plate of wings i'm just

01:00:09.359 --> 01:00:10.559
every once while i'll have the thought

01:00:10.559 --> 01:00:13.040
of like this is seriously

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.760
entire chicken coop yeah dude it's a

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.240
family

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.880
like an entire generation of chickens

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.160
and i'm like oh this one's soft

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.240
do you like pc on yours this is do you

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.079
like one boners or two brothers think

01:00:28.079 --> 01:00:29.200
you get the one that like

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.559
there's like the drumstick shaped ones

01:00:30.559 --> 01:00:32.480
and the weird like yeah ones that are

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.599
shaped like a i don't even know what

01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:34.880
that would even look like but like the

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:35.920
you know the ones you have to like split

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.400
apart

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.680
two bonus two bone that's what it's all

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.680
about is the correct term flat yeah it's

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.559
like i guess

01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:43.040
what a [ __ ]

01:00:51.599 --> 01:00:53.040
so you can do that yeah which is a mess

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.240
i got to bring my other hand into it

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.599
like i can be doing something i can eat

01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:57.440
regular wings with one hand yeah

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.040
genetically modified chickens to turn

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.119
that part of their body just into like

01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:02.880
rather than having a hundred percent

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.240
that would be oh absolutely

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.319
or chicken that just had two like way

01:01:06.319 --> 01:01:07.680

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.079
i start like

01:01:16.079 --> 01:01:17.920
