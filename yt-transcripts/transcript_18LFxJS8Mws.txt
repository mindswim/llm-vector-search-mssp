space right you don't share it or

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.430
knowing the windows are pretty good

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.399
where no one can see into them now

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.050
you're making me kind of nervous about

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.160
what you're gonna be doing on the inside

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.649
but why I just just want to know for my

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.140
privacy I'm yeah I just it's my first

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.670
place by myself I was with my mom before

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.989
and you know we didn't see eye to eye on

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.850
some things so I just want to make it a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.670
private space yeah it's your own

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.110
apartment you can put whatever you want

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.940
on the windows to keep people from

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.670
looking in okay cuz yeah I got to get

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.870
out of here right now me my mom where

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.589
c9i okay I don't not really a fan of

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.540
BDSM and I've really got into it the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.520
last couple months so obviously when I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.320
have some BDSM parties and you know

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.110
she's really not very sex positive and I

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.270
don't know I'm sure I just don't feel

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.580
like she respects me or my gear and all

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.409
the stuff needed to do like host a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.650
successful BDSM party so I have my own

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.900
place and parties if that's what you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.640
need to get by in life I think there's a

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.200

you're really keeping it alive it's a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.920
dying trade right now and if you're into

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.120
increasing your penis size by putting a

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.130
loop on it and just squeezing it really

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.480
hard sort of God that's ancient so

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.700

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.960

oh yeah dark we touched on it last week

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.279
we did we took something like that Matt

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:50.680
uh dissected a frog and ripped its heart

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.959
out yes and now after that we have nice

00:12:55.959 --> 00:12:58.089
conversations have come to light is some

00:12:58.089 --> 00:12:59.620
more you know

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.899
stunning [ __ ] news has come forward

00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:06.579
its I'll explain a little bit of it but

00:13:06.579 --> 00:13:07.870
I think there should be the one to be

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.269
you should paint a picture I'll tell

00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:11.410
them what happened and then we'll hear

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.019
their side of the story so Matt in fifth

00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:17.110
grade was playing what he called

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.629
earthquake with the with a young hamster

00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:22.899
the class hamster Cup so he was just

00:13:22.899 --> 00:13:24.639
rattling his cage every day a little bit

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:27.730
and then it bit him one time yeah and

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.459
because of that he killed the hamster

00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:32.680
and he killed the class hamster in fifth

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.059
grade now this is what's troubling about

00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:36.670
it it wasn't a crime of passion yes it

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.220
was it wasn't it just so much bad kid

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.930
you have too much like Salinas manager

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.079
so he [ __ ] bit him and then how many

00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:49.209
days later did you kill it that day if

00:13:49.209 --> 00:13:51.309
it you have bleach on you so it was in

00:13:51.309 --> 00:13:53.050
the school it was like the school

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.279
cleaning supply okay

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:55.990
so class it him it was that school was

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.149
the hamster was at school school prep

00:13:58.149 --> 00:13:59.769
school raisers the 5th grade is the

00:13:59.769 --> 00:14:01.629
class answer it's in the classroom yes

00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:02.920
Matt left the classroom

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.600
whenever know there was cleaning

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.589
supplies in the school out of the

00:14:05.589 --> 00:14:07.420
classroom ok so yeah that got some of

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.589
the cleaning supplies nice to Huff the

00:14:08.589 --> 00:14:12.040
chalkboard clean really Jesus Christ

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.720
so he took bleach from the school

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.839
janitor and then put it in the hamsters

00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:20.949
water a little bit

00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:22.779
boys endure a little bit I inadvertently

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.399
I didn't think I was here your side of

00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:26.410
this okay guys I settled it and that's

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.300
crazy you hit some of the facts yes I

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.519
was playing earthquake and I I would say

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:31.660
I gave it about like a four point three

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.000
Richter wasn't that bad and I pulled the

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.189
hamster out to [ __ ] coddle it after

00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:38.230
you know it didn't like this little

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.209
earthquake I had given it and if I can

00:14:40.209 --> 00:14:42.929
bit me bit my finger drew first blood

00:14:42.929 --> 00:14:45.069
important factor the story [ __ ]

00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:49.300
holding hamsters accountable I had a

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.449
[ __ ] German true first blood so I

00:14:52.449 --> 00:14:54.579
decided that I would teach it a lesson

00:14:54.579 --> 00:14:57.879
as a ten-year-old boy put a little bit

00:14:57.879 --> 00:15:00.160
of bleach in his water and I come back

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.640
to school the next what else did you do

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.320
then I took there was so in its food I

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.050
found an elbow macaroni somewhere and I

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.420
put glue in it maybe a bite this glue

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.640
filled elbow macaroni so that I you know

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.800
I went home that night who [ __ ] ate a

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.120
bunch of Bagel Bites came back to school

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.600
and it was gone it was dead the hamster

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.579
cage was empty I showed up to school and

00:15:19.579 --> 00:15:20.870
I was like oh my god mrs. McKinley what

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.670
happened she was like a hamster choked

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.529
or something and my cousin told on me

00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:27.920

not real like my mouths not getting an

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.140
exterminator got sticky traps so I

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.760
started showing I open the store so I'd

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.950
show up and they were just before mice

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.410
just like crippled in these sticky traps

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.390

summertime I didn't want to throw these

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:53.600
things out to slowly bacon the Sun yeah

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.590

that's all but that but yeah but then I

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.049
felt bad doing that every morning

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:05.809
imagine going into your job stoned as I

00:18:05.809 --> 00:18:08.330

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.740

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.200
drowning them in like a cup of water and

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.400
then I started giving them cherry coke

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.929
cup of water you would just hold a mouse

00:18:26.929 --> 00:18:28.820
in a cup of one yeah and drown it that

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.950

just a glass of cherry coke and you just

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.580
hold a mouse by his tail yeah and hold

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.960
him in his hold him in or if they're

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.520
stuck to the trap that was easier they

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.960
[ __ ] resist would they start like

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.700
squirming in there dude they couldn't

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.080

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:56.850
think men should express their sexuality

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.680
