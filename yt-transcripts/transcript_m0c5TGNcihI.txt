yeah true i mean all you have do you

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.039
think about being like a defector or

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:09.199
some sort like i if you were to be like

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:11.360
an anti say like we became under like an

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.440
all-women dictatorship which i think

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.759
it's [ __ ] going that way no it's not

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:18.319
it is dude every powerful man now dude

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.479
every powerful man now is getting ousted

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:22.479
yeah but everyone's got so many it's

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:24.240
like

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.120
now it's like 42 since harvey wein

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.639
sure it's going to trickle down that's

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.160
an exponential thing there's going to be

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
some reaganomics on this sexual assault

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.280
thing but

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.639
also it's going to get to the point

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:37.840
where it's like like even with louie

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.479
everyone's like

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.960
like if they keep calling everyone out

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.720
yeah it's like

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.919
we're gonna be like all right well which

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:48.240
one did he actually rape someone or was

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.919

million times now who cares let him go

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.280
that was a whole movie waiting

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.160
it was just restaurants show

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.360
after i saw that movie i was showing

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.240
people my nuts constantly i mean guys

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.240
but still hey someone like a girl might

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.520
have caught some of the crossfire dude i

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.879
think i think a bunch of girls did see

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:08.560
me do the lights game yeah definitely at

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.360
elon university i moved a girl on my bus

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.120
and got in trouble really yeah my

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.919
husband pack got kicked off the bus

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:17.440
i think he did full red eye he like

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.080
pulled his butthole

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:23.599
i should have doxxed my cousin

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.199
i was just like rolled right off my

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:27.840
tongue

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:31.039
yeah when the women control

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:33.360
i think hillary clinton's gonna die and

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.440
all her like all her space magic you

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.880
were talking about is gonna go into the

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.479
earth and just get replenished

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:40.240
retrograded mercury yeah dude that's

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.839
going to go into the earth and just be

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:42.719
absorbed what do you think she's

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:44.480
probably a [ __ ]

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.640
aries oh she's definitely on the cusp of

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.160
like three different signs dude she's

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.080
got to be so powerful apparently she

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.839
broke her ankle and like she hurt her

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.600
ankle and uh

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.959
there's a big conspiracy there's a lot

00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:56.480
of conspiracy theories around her

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.480
injuries like she'll limp and everyone's

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.800
like she's got aids she's dying

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.959
basically she gets imdb to every [ __ ]

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.680
yeah i don't know what's that

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.600
every single [ __ ] like if she sneezes

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.640
everyone's like brain cancer

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.040
but yeah i think when women eventually

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.120
take over control of the government

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.800
it'll be if you're like resisting them

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.240
or trying to like splinter them it'll be

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.760
so easy to just be like yo you know

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.040
who's [ __ ] really hot and they'll

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.399
just be like

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:24.800
yeah if spanish in congress is just like

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.760

goo lag

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.519

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:43.040

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.560

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.440
and they were like

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.200
place like they were like your podcast

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.079

funny but i don't listen to it because

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:57.360
obviously like i said she's yeah she's a

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.440
broad that has some broad ideas truth

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.959

trump just said that the capital of

israel should be jerusalem

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.240

[ __ ] idiots that voted for trump are

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:49.360
i was like uh how about obama

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.079
pretty sure he he was pretty pro-israel

00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:53.279
what are you talking about how about

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:55.120
every president ever what'd she say and

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.480
she was like

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.120
oh dude you hit her with saint obama

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.959
i hit her with the [ __ ]

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:02.880
that's my [ __ ] dude i have my [ __ ]

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.639
facts to back that up well that's yeah

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.760
they're like they've been there for

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.680
thousands of years before the israeli

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.680
[ __ ] settlement and it's like they

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.240
weren't even a country ever yeah so shut

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.000
the [ __ ] up palestine where were they

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.839
like clowns ottoman empire before world

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:17.600
war one okay they were british

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.240
controlled pre-world war two

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.920
and then post world war ii was israel

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.360
and palestine

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.959
okay

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:26.399
so what were they so they were just a

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:27.680
bunch of people living there i mean they

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.440
were palestinians but they i don't think

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.720
they were at a country it was within the

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.560
ottoman empire yeah so there were clans

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.040
living in like uh no man's land yeah

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.720
well i mean it wasn't a no man's land

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.680
it's like the kurds that live in like

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.240
iraq and syria now okay that's kurdistan

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.160
but it's not a country yeah yeah i got

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.839
you you know what i mean yeah it's like

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:47.440
it's like we live in manchu but it's

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.360
like no one calls it manchester unless

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.279
you live here true there's no there's no

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:52.720
real punchline to this story it's just

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.079
funny to me that

00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:57.519
liberal cause is now pro-palestine

00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:59.519
yeah it's weird i could i could see how

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:00.480
that would happen though because i've

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.000
read about that well i when i used to

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.120
like

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.560
and again this is when i used to smoke

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.920
copious amounts of weed i remember

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.279
thinking like

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:08.240
well

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.920
why would those guys just fly planes in

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.360
the building we definitely did we

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.880
definitely did [ __ ] up stuff sure and

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.000
then i read

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.760
half of confessions of an economic hit

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.959
man and stopped because it was boring

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:18.959
and it was like i knew it

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.199
i knew we were wrong well i mean of

00:15:21.199 --> 00:15:23.120
course there were some wrong yeah for

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.120
sure i mean of course and just like

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.320
israel and that's what i said to her i

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.440
wasn't like

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.199
oh i'm definitely pro-israel i was just

00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:31.199
like it's weird to take his side in this

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:32.720
yeah like it's weird it's exactly that's

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.560
what's bizarre it's weird to be like

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.720
like i i mean of course i'm

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.279
i'm not gonna say i'm pro-israel like

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:40.959
that yeah exactly

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.959
but i'm not gonna be like get them the

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:45.279
[ __ ] out of there like i'm i'm just like

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:46.720
i'm out of that i don't give a [ __ ]

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.639
exactly and it's weird to be a feminist

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:50.639
and love dude i know people will give

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:52.560
you [ __ ] forever and it's like like the

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.759
one time i'll start with the hand made

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:55.440
in style how like that book purchase

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.720
went up and you literally said you're

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.120
like you mean like [ __ ]

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.519
sharia law it's like the same that's

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:04.399
sale yeah and for them to be like so

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:05.920
everyone who's such an atheist to be

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.519
like well islam such a beautiful it's

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:08.959
like dude if you're going to pick one

00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:11.360
religion why yeah [ __ ] deal why are

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.040
we picking the worst one why and they're

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.639
like well the bible has bad stuff it's

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:16.560
like yeah it is but like the

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.560
priest the fundamentalists

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.680
christians

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.680
who go and kill people

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.120
are

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.120
punished by the law yeah and if you are

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.040
a fundamentalist islam living in an

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.519
islamic country that goes on sri law

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:31.519
they're like yeah nice yeah way to bomb

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:32.880
a bunch of people we're in full support

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.519
of you like hamas in palestine yeah

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:37.120
and it's funny because then i watched

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.560
this thing and it's cool it's called

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.720
crash course history it's on youtube

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.920
it's pretty sick the guy's a [ __ ]

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.079
huge tool yeah who makes them but he

00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:45.440
does like

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.000
like 10 15 minute videos about certain

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.360
topics so i watched the

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.279
israeli-palestine one

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:53.680
and it's good except he's he's liberal

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.759
enough that he glosses over

00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:58.240
he glosses over terrorism

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.320
he's like and then in i think it was

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.480
like 2007 or 2008

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.839
when hamas gained control of palestine

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.679
he was like

00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:09.520
hamas which is considered a terrorist

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.880
organization because they target

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.640
civilians with suicide bombings but

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.000
they're also they gained a lot of

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.360
traction for all the

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.199
the the works they've done with the

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:19.600
people like schools and hospitals it's

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.959
like

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:23.120
yeah i mean same with [ __ ] al qaeda

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.199
yeah and the taliban i mean they built

00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:27.280
some schools but they also you know well

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.720
dude what goes on in those [ __ ]

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.480
schools too it's like they build schools

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.679
where you're indoctrinated to like

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:33.600
literally we should kill all the jews

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.360
wipe out westerners so it's like yeah

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.200
they they [ __ ] build schools dude

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.559
yeah if i was building like white

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:40.000
nationalist schools

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.520
i can't be like yeah well [ __ ] dude come

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.360
on yeah this might go to school

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.960
so yeah there's no time stables and [ __ ]

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.200
but those schools aren't [ __ ] like

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.520
people learning how to swim times tables

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.360
science it's like

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.360
ala created the universe kill all the

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.320
jews

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.400
five times six is thirty if you're a

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.640
woman uh get the [ __ ] out of this class

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.200
it's like that's insane to do that

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.440
also it was funny take a look at israeli

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.799
history it's pretty funny to watch how

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:07.039
much they just [ __ ] up the middle east

00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:08.720
really like the middle east any country

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.880
will like try to get after them and they

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.200
just bury them there's like six days

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.679
wars where they just defeat like egypt

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.919
[ __ ] everybody i wouldn't i wouldn't

00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:19.360
want to battle the jews

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.840
i would not want if i was the country if

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.640
like

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.919
i was in charge of a country and the

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:25.200
jews were like you guys want to fight

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.840
i'd be like nope no

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.080
no first off the jews got america on

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.240

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.960
the united states

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.720

easily we're in control of all the

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.240
newspapers we're going to write some

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.840
[ __ ] and get all those hillbillies fired

that's the best dude you're like [ __ ]

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.360
such a power move exactly

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.720
we got all of our hunting they're like

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.320

your dad's got it on his truck

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:02.420
[Music]

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.400
[Laughter]

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.280
yeah

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.880
they're crafty that's a funny thing to

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.120
do is to like the united just envision

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.679
the united states is this like pit bull

00:19:11.679 --> 00:19:13.120
and anytime someone [ __ ] with israel

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.720
they just rattle our cage a little bit

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.440

yeah so it's uh

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.520
that's a double bind though for people

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.880
who are like like serious white

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.799

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.600
liberal version of

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.600
when a white guy

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.880

conservatives version is like

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.880

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.720
brutal series of open mics it's like

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.279

army navy game was this weekend what

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.360
happened but i talked about that before

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.960
by the time i ran into my old squad

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.200

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.799
i mean it makes sense no i can see that

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:35.679
but like

00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:37.279

dude and then people should be enlisted

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.360

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.200
like oh man i i tried to get in i

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.440

oh they're trying to hit you with that

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.399

00:32:04.399 --> 00:32:06.080
it's like she sucks you couldn't get in

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.360

the bible about this i'm dude i'm seeing

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:20.640
no

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.800

before they go see what they're working

00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:25.680
with if they have a big dick like we

coming soon i think this is it

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.839
it's so funny we're going to be

00:47:03.839 --> 00:47:05.119
oppressed it's like us and we're just

00:47:05.119 --> 00:47:06.319
sitting there and it's like you know

00:47:06.319 --> 00:47:07.760
they walked around in little nuns

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.800
outfits

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.280
it's it's also it's funny to say like

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.040
because if you say that a woman's gonna

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.880
be like oh you mean like we are right

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.760
now yeah how we've always been oppressed

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.760
yeah it's like yeah exactly we don't

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.760
want that yes

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.040
[Laughter]

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.640
we've been we've we're the best so we

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.319
don't want to be the worst now yeah

00:47:26.319 --> 00:47:28.400
exactly there's only two spots

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.240
well it's it's also yeah and it's also

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.359
like

00:47:31.359 --> 00:47:32.880
the whole thing is a joke the idea of

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.480
thinking like

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.160
our whole our worst case scenario is

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.599
that we have to behave ourselves it's

00:47:37.599 --> 00:47:39.680
like dude this is [ __ ] yeah this is

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.119
ridiculous like you said this is it's

00:47:41.119 --> 00:47:42.480
gonna suck when we can't show our dicks

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.560
to everyone i know can't your dicks

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.240
can't ask co-workers for sex that's the

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.680
other thing too it's like

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.200
think about how many people have like

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.359
made out at all office christmas parties

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:52.800
sure they're gonna have to pull back on

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.720
the alcohol at those things yeah well

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.000
fun time is over

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.839
time for everyone to get to bed dude

00:47:57.839 --> 00:47:59.119
that's the other thing

00:47:59.119 --> 00:48:00.960
what are we working towards

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.920
like working towards a no fun

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.880
dick it's like super chase atheists it's

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.160
like we're reverting into like some

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.920
weird religious fundamentalism with no

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.359
god

00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:14.079
damn whoa yeah isn't that wild you're

00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:15.119
getting wise that's what we're that's

00:48:15.119 --> 00:48:16.079
what we're working towards we're

00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:17.040
becoming

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.760
almost puritan we're re-becoming

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.800
well

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.640
you don't you don't need god to get like

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.559
uh like soviet russia

00:48:24.559 --> 00:48:26.800
yeah it was godless but they also were

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.240
very strict i don't know how they were

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.079
sexual but like

00:48:30.079 --> 00:48:31.760
a lot of rapes i'd imagine

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.680
yeah i bet soviet

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.079
skyrocketing a lot of lifted [ __ ]

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:38.400
ankle-length dresses over there oh i

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.920
would just say i don't imagine them be

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.280
like oh come to bed if i live

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.920
that's good thank you

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.599
but yeah the uh

00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:49.359
us rev yeah i don't know because it's

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.800
weird because at the same time women's

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.559
sexuality is

00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:55.119
glorified mm-hmm now dildos by the

00:48:55.119 --> 00:48:56.640
liberal

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.400
perspective of course like show your

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.480
nipples in public yeah oh my god women

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.200
are

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.960
like the feminists i mean

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.559
movement so it's like men

00:49:04.559 --> 00:49:07.119
put your dicks away women tits out yup

00:49:07.119 --> 00:49:08.319
nobody has the right to tell you to put

00:49:08.319 --> 00:49:09.680
your tits away ass cheeks out that's a

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.040
good point bring out your ass cheeks

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.319
it's totally yeah why can't i show some

00:49:12.319 --> 00:49:14.079
like balls or something dude

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:16.640
i'm sure you could show your balls

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.000
i think it's when you show your balls at

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.680
someone true

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.040
trill like when you're like dude come

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.480
here look at this let's get my [ __ ]

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.400
dick then it gets weird but if you i bet

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.839
if you just walk you can walk into your

00:49:25.839 --> 00:49:27.599
place of work with your dick out they

00:49:27.599 --> 00:49:30.400
can't take it

00:49:31.359 --> 00:49:32.319
if you

00:49:32.319 --> 00:49:34.160
walk in with your balls and dick out

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.000
well if you if you were directing anyone

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.520
not directing it nothing sexual i think

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.800
what you'd have to do is hold one of

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.880
those like 1950s housewives tanning

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.480
things you know like reflect on their

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.839
face just hold one of those and have

00:49:43.839 --> 00:49:45.599
your bird exposed but like block it from

00:49:45.599 --> 00:49:47.359
everyone sure or you could hold your

00:49:47.359 --> 00:49:48.800
bird on top of it you could lay it

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.880
underneath it like a plate

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.480
just if you walk around presenting your

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.960
dick naturally

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.520
there's nothing there

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.359
this is [ __ ] dude it's not fair

00:50:01.359 --> 00:50:03.599
life sucks now life's [ __ ] gay can't

00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:05.200
ask for head

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.480
i don't know who's getting ahead without

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.079
asking dude

00:50:08.079 --> 00:50:09.920
what no one's getting hit without asking

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.760
for it true you don't find bugs unless

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.440
you lift up a rock dude exactly right

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:14.480
you're not just walking around like i

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.599

00:50:15.599 --> 00:50:17.040
eventually die and be like oh no you're

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:17.920
good

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.760
yeah and even when you do get head it's

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.599
always such a corny reason now if you're

00:50:21.599 --> 00:50:23.359
in a long-term it's always like it's

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:25.920
valentine's day

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.680

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.000
from like you're wearing some [ __ ]

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.119
business casual you don't want head

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:40.319
you're dick's sticking out a dress

00:50:40.319 --> 00:50:41.520
that's right that's what i responded

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.640
because at one point you were talking

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.920
about uh

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.440
people who got like bullied or shitty in

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.480
high school

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.079
and now like there was this there's a

00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:49.599
show on netflix

00:50:49.599 --> 00:50:51.839
it's like uh power up or something like

00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:53.839
girls wanted power i forget what it is

00:50:53.839 --> 00:50:56.079
but it's about like sexuality in america

00:50:56.079 --> 00:50:58.160
and like with modern technology it's not

00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.760
a show it's like a documentary style

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.839
sketch episodes something different but

00:51:01.839 --> 00:51:03.920
the one episode is this guy

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.880
who's like

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.800
over 40 he lives in las vegas and he

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.200
just uses tinder and he [ __ ]

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.720
constantly yeah he's just always [ __ ]

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.599
chicks he was on the show big brother

00:51:15.599 --> 00:51:17.280
so his tenor accounts that's all it

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.280
takes to crush him and he just [ __ ]

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.599
every day he ghosts everyone

00:51:21.599 --> 00:51:24.000
and but dude you gotta watch it there's

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.200
not a there's

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.400
he's one of the biggest douches i've

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.599
ever seen of course yeah and then he was

00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:28.720
like well

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.640

from girls i didn't lose my virginity

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:36.880

00:51:45.839 --> 00:51:48.079
like i'm all about getting [ __ ] and i

00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:48.960

00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:08.160
blatantly trying to trick them ugh yeah

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.079
it's just a weird [ __ ] dynamic the

00:52:10.079 --> 00:52:11.680
whole pickup artist cultures pick-up

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.760

00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:23.040
and being like yes i'm gonna do it that

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.319

the pickup party that's again yes that

00:52:39.599 --> 00:52:41.119

complete retards or are they are you

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.200

00:53:25.599 --> 00:53:27.359

it's happened to me twice

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:31.040
women have grabbed my dick but when i

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.960

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.880
for example the girls in this show on

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:43.520
netflix like love this guy

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.520

jagger

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:48.240

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.400
like

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.920

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.160
world

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:05.160
[ __ ]

literally now it's like it's actually

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:13.839
kind of crazy because if you're like a

00:59:13.839 --> 00:59:16.079
mid-level manager and you don't like a

00:59:16.079 --> 00:59:18.079

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.640
horrible

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.000
you can get a lot of [ __ ] and you're

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.240
willing to trick women exactly you're

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.480
willing to go online and be like

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.520
one day

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.000
crazy dude you just ran me over on our

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
date i didn't have anything to say back

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.839
that guy was a classic chess that was

00:59:33.839 --> 00:59:35.520
the revenge of a chest

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:36.960
and the thing the guy talks about how

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.480
all his friends in high school were

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.839
girls and they kept being like you're

00:59:39.839 --> 00:59:42.079
just like my brother yeah so instead of

00:59:42.079 --> 00:59:44.160
like he was like well [ __ ] this then i'm

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.760
gonna [ __ ] these girls and be like a

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:47.520
wild man that's like

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.599
the thing too that'll crush that guy if

00:59:49.599 --> 00:59:51.440
he ever was to be in like a relationship

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.799
and he was like on a double date type

00:59:52.799 --> 00:59:54.799
thing as soon as he came across a real

00:59:54.799 --> 00:59:57.359
wild man dude his whole [ __ ] jigs up

00:59:57.359 --> 00:59:59.200
yeah yeah yeah somebody who's actually

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.359
cool exactly because he cause like you

01:00:01.359 --> 01:00:02.640
were saying i mean he's like a [ __ ]

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.720
chameleon he's a [ __ ] lizard that

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.160
like he just

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.400
he just acts however he wants like he

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.880
knows what to say to these women yeah

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.400
to dumb 22 year old girls he's 43. dude

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.720
his exactly it's disgusting

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.160
it's really nice it's like playing

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.000
madden on [ __ ] rookie it's just like

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.079
oh wow there's three plays that work so

01:00:22.079 --> 01:00:23.280
i knew i got the super bowl it's like

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.280
you played on rocky yeah i sent antonio

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.359
bryant on a hot route fly touchdown

01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:29.040
every time and that's then the argument

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.160
is like well those chicks are so hot

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.599
they're like yeah dude

01:00:31.599 --> 01:00:34.799
they're 24 they're [ __ ] blazing hot

01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:36.079
but

01:00:36.079 --> 01:00:38.000
it's like of course easy

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.680
it's hunting prairie dogs dude it's

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.520
frustrating to watch it is that is

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.200
annoying to watch sucks

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.839
he acts like he's he's got a like but

01:00:45.839 --> 01:00:47.359
that's uh the whole other thing though

01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:48.720
is like so it's like yeah you're [ __ ]

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.400
these chicks but like how are you

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.240
[ __ ] these chicks yeah he's putting

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.480
on [ __ ] trojan skins or whatever he's

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.400
probably just like calf can't feel his

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.160
dick he's definitely a porn addict

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.319
that's the behavior of a porn addict

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:01.760
so he's probably like half limp and

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.680
drunk chucking in like a noodle in these

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.760
24 year olds and then he's like

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.079

01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:09.599

01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:15.680
cries and he's just like special time

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.280
he probably touches her [ __ ] and cries

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.799
and is like [ __ ] you i'll never talk to

01:01:18.799 --> 01:01:20.480

01:02:08.319 --> 01:02:09.520
like cause i remember i discovered that

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.960
as a young man because like when you're

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.799
dating as a young man your threat the

01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:14.160
constant thing is like well if someone

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.520
[ __ ] my girlfriend they're really good

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.480
at it

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.920
they'll always they'll be someone in

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.960
their head that's better than me and

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.640
then like the just like a realization at

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.960
like 24 like you don't feel the best of

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.839
sex

01:02:23.839 --> 01:02:25.040
you don't even have to be good at it it

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.400
doesn't matter it literally doesn't

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.079
matter at all like no one's keeping

01:02:28.079 --> 01:02:29.119
halls

01:02:29.119 --> 01:02:30.880
10 minutes of uh

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.040
your relationship once a week it's like

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.480
you really don't have to be that great

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.960
at it well it's that too and it's like

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.720
i can't remember everyone who ever had

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.079
sex was like who was the best i'm like

01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:41.520
whoever i'm having sex with is the best

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.480
dude

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.480
literally like it's just the best yeah

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.599
but

01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:48.799
like that guy just that's the thing that

01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:50.319
bothers me about

01:02:50.319 --> 01:02:52.400
like thinking of somebody else dating my

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.799
girlfriend yeah or an ex-girlfriend or

01:02:54.799 --> 01:02:56.640
anything like that it's like

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.799
i might if it's a normal guy but if it's

01:02:58.799 --> 01:03:01.119
a guy that's like tricking them

01:03:01.119 --> 01:03:03.680
if it's a corny [ __ ] douche it's like

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:06.400
chivalry's not dead babe i hold the door

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.400

doing behind locked doors too what's

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.520
that he's like not like he's probably

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.200
destroying butts and stuff he's probably

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.440

you yeah just

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.440
if i just don't want to see girls get

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.079
tricked yeah it's so [ __ ] annoying

01:03:32.079 --> 01:03:33.599
yeah it is

01:03:33.599 --> 01:03:35.760
like corny douches now if marshall faulk

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.760
comes in and takes his dick out that's

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.680
sick he deserves it yeah

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.480
that's true he rushed for 10 000 yards

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.000
can he take his dick out he should get

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.680
one it should be about ten thousand

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.359
yards he's like one day he's probably

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.360
you to apostate is they put a picture of

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.560
jesus on the ground you're supposed to

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.320

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.560
dramatic moment and he's like

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.920

you've been holding in the fact that you

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:46.880
come on your laptop that's the move i

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.080
thought you stand up from your computer

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.400
chair and [ __ ] rip it

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.920

have a 55 inch tv now i could get you

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.920
just some condoms you ever not into a

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.679
condom when you're jerking oh that's

01:20:59.679 --> 01:21:01.600
that was that was my shower go-to it's a

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.960
great move but that's a whole other

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.000
thing where i'm like pretending i'm

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.120
having sex with a hooker and i have a

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.480
condom on so that's like not like a

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.630
[ __ ] good move either

01:21:07.630 --> 01:21:09.679
[Laughter]

01:21:09.679 --> 01:21:11.679
i've never equated that wearing condoms

01:21:11.679 --> 01:21:13.920
to hookers

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.360
i usually jerk off with condoms in the

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.199
shower and be like hooker's jerking me

01:21:17.199 --> 01:21:19.679
off i'm jerking i'm with the hooker

01:21:19.679 --> 01:21:20.960
so i don't check off the condoms that's

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.159
another form of sand dude you gotta

01:21:22.159 --> 01:21:23.760
stand up and you gotta stand to deliver

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.199
dude

01:21:25.199 --> 01:21:26.560

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.520
someone's giving me a hand job from

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.840

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.800
rant at the beginning they made it they

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.719
found gold at the end of this dude it

01:21:44.719 --> 01:21:46.400
wasn't islamophobic that was just

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.040
pro-israel pro-women and very pro-women

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.880
