everything right oh yes all we can do

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.410

got [ __ ] but what the coat what's the

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.790
coach's message we didn't get it what's

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:18.630
his name again taking me when you watch

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.820
the YouTube videos I got they give a

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:25.440
whistle yeah he's a coach how much is it

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.030
fair to ask him how much [ __ ] he gets

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.540
uh I mean I think he would probably do

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.540
all right it's just but I don't know

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.460
that's not pressure for a girl if you're

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.590
like what do you do I teach guys how to

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.720
get [ __ ] right I'd be kind of hesitant

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.900
and enter in that relationship teach

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.590
guys the tricks to get [ __ ] well it's

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.390
not about tricking what's it about well

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.720
it's just about being in your masculine

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.110
center okay Oh a big dick so he's like

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.670
all rights guy has a big dick right

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:01.140
don't know so he's all right I don't

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.580
believe you should [ __ ] Western

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.030
chauvinist for sure he does so he's like

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.010
this America yeah that makes sense so

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.220
this guy's he's

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.070
he's saying like be mask is possible

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.530
right to these to these hoes if you're a

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.360
coach you love America that's true

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.340
coach of anything well know so it's

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.100
funny saying be mask it's like so I give

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:21.910
you an example

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.550
there's what he would call the illusion

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:29.580
of action which is like if a girl starts

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.970
coach Cory Wayne dude ha if a girl

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.000
starts pulling away physically when your

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.280
first date he's got a boat Dan that's

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.150
way that's when he's captain Cory Wayne

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:48.100
so she physically pulls away from women

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.980
you should avoid by coach Cory Wayne so

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.440
he says if you woman is pulling away in

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.850
the dating relationship

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.160
what do you push the gas or do you chill

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.260
back no you have to hang back of course

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.100
and this but the the way I you put the

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.220
[ __ ] on ice yeah sure yeah ok I think

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.570
that's intuitive for a lot of guys and

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.790
not for others like myself who it's like

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.530
if she starts to back away then you go

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.630
oh I got to do something and it said

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.120
like a funny text or a thing but that

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.280
just exacerbates the problem so you like

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.870
if she's not if she's ignoring you you

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.530
hit her with a [ __ ] good joke right

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.240
that's terrible oh you do now you're

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.650
just going tick-tock and like wrap a

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.660
little bit and let her see it you're

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.880
gonna learn something tick-tock yes we

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.370
gotta get you into being a fairy they

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.340
cross cheese you go as a mouse good

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.710
[ __ ] Chuck E Cheese costume so this

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.000
was this how long you been working with

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.790
the coach no I feel bad I feel bad you

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.320
feel bad like spiritually emotionally

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.300
physically it's just tough to be like

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.350
true don't worry about it I feel like

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.830
you're doing great

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.920
no so it's just about exactly like what

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.540
Shane said like I would just do the

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.450
wrong thing so I was like simple things

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.120
like if you're I find if I was on the

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.410
date I would try and set up the next

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.690
date for sure which is like don't do

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:14.310
that you leave prepare your boxers there

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.950
no no but it's things like that and then

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.470
if your job is the guy is to set up the

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.629
date so it's like you

00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:24.040
especially in the beginning it's like

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.360
you're only calling to set up the date

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.269
and then if she contacts you that's her

00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:29.800
reaching out and you set up a date but

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.959
then you don't you don't keep texting

00:15:31.959 --> 00:15:34.420
because like that's not you're busy yeah

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.699
you can't and and then again if she

00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:38.499
pulls back you have to give her space

00:15:38.499 --> 00:15:40.870
and and then the more you try and fix

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.269
that it's just like you're done or you

00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:46.300
go kidnap her right true there's two

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.249
ways of doing this you either all in or

00:15:48.249 --> 00:15:50.589
not there's no there's no tiptoeing you

00:15:50.589 --> 00:15:52.540
gotta go full sharia if she if she wants

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.920
space yeah we have a little chat show up

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.569

00:15:58.569 --> 00:16:00.220
feel about is going on to it tinder and

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.509
it's swiping every single person just

00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:06.730
like what to do if you're on a date or

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.670
or in dating we're in a relationship

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:18.699
so you give sex advice right to the

00:16:18.699 --> 00:16:24.519
[ __ ] oil driller on the couch and

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:25.959
then you tip her over so we're heads on

00:16:25.959 --> 00:16:28.149
the floor and now you [ __ ] drop down

00:16:28.149 --> 00:16:30.579

start dating somebody he's like men can

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.050
fall in love quick women fall in love

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.000
slow so like if a guy finds a chick

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.410
attractive it's like then we'll just

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.600
find reasons to like her yeah along the

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:05.720
way but a woman needs time but for so

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.820
then you just immediately kind of want

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.770
to know where you stand but if she's an

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.060
attractive girl she's got tons of

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:11.900
options

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.310
sure so she's on the lookout for

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.130
neediness and so the moment you show

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.510
that you can't be patient and like

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.760
congruent with what you say so to be

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.190
like what did he like stick his head

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:27.080
inside of a [ __ ] and learn sorry that's

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.780
what I imagine and I certainly I think

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.280
imagine coach Corey when downloading the

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.010
information is the [ __ ] tomato says

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:35.240
if so what you saying that you're on the

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.950
lookout for neediness yes you have to

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.080
basically play it cool yeah yeah yeah

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.520

to all caps to go to Twitter and just

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.180
watered down and it was unbelievable

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.830
the fact where I was like I was really

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.300
wondering if people really believe that

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.030
like are people like kind of like do

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.500
people really believe this no I don't

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.850
know what's worse or what you know if

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.790
they don't get it it's like Jesus Christ

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:39.260
and like you could you could reach out

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.550
to Jay like big Jay is a nice sure guy

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.350
like if you told him that he'd be like

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.070
okay whatever

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.780
yeah that would be it that look you're

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.309
gonna get a bunch of [ __ ] for having my

00:33:49.309 --> 00:33:51.110
Louis I don't even know what he's ever

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.730
said or like what his problem is that's

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.080
another thing if you look into it it's

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.309
like yeah he's said a bunch of dumb [ __ ]

00:33:55.309 --> 00:33:58.970
yeah he's a [ __ ] weirdo sure and it's

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.309
it you have him on and [ __ ] around with

00:34:01.309 --> 00:34:02.870
him on a pot you're gonna set you're

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.820
gonna start telling people who they can

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.500
and cannot have on dude it's like you

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.149
just you don't have that authority it's

00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:09.320
so weird

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.600
yeah if someone had like a lame guess on

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.280
or even someone like I downright hated

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:22.440

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.860
comments were I was shocked about from

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.450
all those other comics who are just kind

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:41.270
of like and acted like I just cannot

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:45.380
clear the opportunity ISM was so obvious

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.210
and transparent to be like this is my

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:47.870
moment

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:49.400
there's gonna be a million blogs but

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.590
like why I reacted to blah blah blah

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:53.420
it's like dude nobody gives a [ __ ] yeah

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.210
man no it's like look at what Milo was

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.850
just on he's on like HBO he's on like

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:01.130
he's done a ton of [ __ ] he was on Rogen

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.410
yeah it's like Rogen Rogen [ __ ]

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.440
destroyed him dude Rogen [ __ ]

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.580
destroys Milo it's like you do I mean

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.960
like you don't love Jesus and Milo's

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.750
like yes I do know is that what they

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.300
talked about I like red you know who

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.580
doesn't love Jesus he'll Kirby's you're

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:22.250
an atheist you know that about me he

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.680
hates religion atheism is a religion no

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.570
it's not yes it is dude it's a logical

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.880
leap of faith people take notes it's a

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.050
religion sure is it's rigid it's a

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:38.120
rejection of claims sure about certain

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.140
there is no God

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.540
right claim on the truth I would I don't

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.370
claim that there certainly is not

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.610
alright so you're not an atheist yeah

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:47.930
that's a theist would consider

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.940
themselves you'd say well I cuz you

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.010
can't probably to quantify that I don't

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:53.660
I don't think because that's not what

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.940
you do you go I don't know is a God and

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.920
he I don't know that there's a God I

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.900
wouldn't call myself an atheist you're a

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.270
theist is a logical belief agnostic is

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:06.260
the word yeah it's not like oh I think

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.300
that this could be a guy there could not

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.740
be okay so then you believe there

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.620
absolutely is not no okay so then could

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.140
be a god or could not be is agnostic but

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.910
there also could be like other

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:21.170
ridiculous simulation sure it's pretty

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:22.960
you know it could happen

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.510
so you're an atheist yeah yeah

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:32.950
don't think there's a religion atheist J

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.730
like most Catholics yeah yeah but no III

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.520

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.270
getting into that stuff yeah Dolan's

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.190
taking it back way I'm thinking it way

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:53.760
way back Oh Catholic dude no well I was

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.000
reading about the horrors or Islam

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.200
Islam's the [ __ ] they're dead they're

00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.790
dead they were they were necessary

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.580
stepping stones for like again the stuff

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.960
that I'm into when people legitimately

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.150
were like yeah we're basically just

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:07.260
animals and we live out here and

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.820
sacrifice each other and Catholics came

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.800
by really no no you guys are gods you're

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.570
defined no Catholics came around like

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:14.640
stop [ __ ] killing each other and get

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.950
inside it's not exactly but it's not it

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:18.900
wasn't as diabolical everyone's like

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.340
they're like they saw people tripping

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.110
and having fun and we're like knock it

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.430
off yeah yeah there's more like they

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:24.960
were like sacrifice magic if you were

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.850
like came down an island you saw some

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:29.270
lady get her head cut off and was like

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:33.390
hey I got a book you guys yeah and it

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.430
was such an easy pitch like cuz like you

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:37.560
just give someone like salt and they're

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.170
like what the [ __ ] is that

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:42.030
I like slip outside I'm like if someone

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:43.560
came up to me it was like hit it hit

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.670
this little Hut up and it was like kind

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.500
of warm I'd been like someone had like

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:51.480
12 buffalo wings yeah alright so what

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.710
you're telling me I'm not an animal I'm

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.930
a

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:55.630
God and now can have salt I'm like

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:58.030
alright done so in my head I was like it

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.950
was a necessary step but I think it's

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:02.170
like it's run its course well that's now

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:04.450
you sound like O'Connor and Gary B's now

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.480
they think religion was a necessary evil

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.530
okay I don't think it's an evil and not

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:10.230
necessarily an evil but it wasn't it was

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.640
necessary to get us now every minute

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.099
that's and they the new Elon Musk space

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:17.260
that's where I detach because that

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.510
trying to get to Mars dude I do that's

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.130
where I detach because that's just the

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:23.230
transfer of religious ideology into

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:24.550
another space where they're like

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.650
religions dumb I believe in us travel in

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.480
a space and one day we'll live forever

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.579
in computers it's like okay that's a

00:42:30.579 --> 00:42:32.800
whole other religion but yeah I religion

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.780
is you're just reverting back I'm into

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.460
the archetypes they're people need to

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.170
have some sort of religious belief

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:40.089
structure something on some level where

00:42:40.089 --> 00:42:41.800
they interface with the mystic because

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.140
we lost that dude yeah we've lost it no

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.599
I think Scott fais you interface to the

00:42:46.599 --> 00:42:48.849
mystic I believe the mystic you're like

00:42:48.849 --> 00:42:51.520
you're like a um like a drunken Shaolin

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:57.990
monk dude drunken [ __ ] retards lately

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:01.390
people are so [ __ ] it's it's like it's

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:06.099
just weird thing about how miserable

00:43:06.099 --> 00:43:07.750
everybody it'd be most people are

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:09.280
slightly kind of [ __ ] up and miserable

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.599
for some reason if you're like why don't

00:43:10.599 --> 00:43:12.880
like I don't know I'm just [ __ ] up

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.760
right now maybe they always have been

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.650
that's what drives us yeah but I don't

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:20.040
need that good depression anxiety to

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.510
[ __ ] go oh yeah we talked about this

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:23.799
last week what that's what I [ __ ]

00:43:23.799 --> 00:43:24.819
live off of

00:43:24.819 --> 00:43:26.260
oh you're fueled by all that is fueled

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.930
entirely by [ __ ] itself hate no I

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.670
don't know I'm gonna think now where I'm

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:33.540
trying to come up with a palatable

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:37.299
mystical belief structure so that's why

00:43:37.299 --> 00:43:38.619
I eat mushrooms to sit on myself and my

00:43:38.619 --> 00:43:44.380
little deck finding god dude I [ __ ] man

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.950
I had do you think Kirby's is dead he's

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.079
laying he's like an old sick dog you

00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:55.450
went under the porch I've been I've been

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.460
Slyke every week I come here I talk

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.839
about the same [ __ ] dude I just been

00:43:58.839 --> 00:44:00.819
climbing that stairway to heaven I just

00:44:00.819 --> 00:44:02.799
keep giving myself like bigger and

00:44:02.799 --> 00:44:04.059
bigger weed edibles and just I've been

00:44:04.059 --> 00:44:06.760
trying to champ them as my best ability

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.650
I will say if anyone wants to do this

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:11.500
there's that it's the [ __ ] what's it

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:11.859
called

00:44:11.859 --> 00:44:15.010
it's that Paul Stamets my co defense or

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:17.650
host defense if you google host defense

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:18.940
brain supplement that's the one I'm

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:20.380
talking about it has a go-to cola and

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.240
the other stuff in there I need to see

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.740
if this is just me but I swear to God

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.109
when you take that stuff it intensifies

00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:27.540
edibles to the point where they're like

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.500
hallucinatory it's insane

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.240
really well that link you know I'm not

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.040
like exceed like ghosts and [ __ ] yeah

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:36.220
but like my last week I did my little

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:37.570
micro dose thing and I'm like alright

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:39.369
yes easy you just like it's really you

00:44:39.369 --> 00:44:40.540
know that's pretty easy to do and I'm

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.100
slowly ramping that up so I'm trying to

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.050
get back to just like tripping as hard

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:45.400
as possible and I could just eat a bunch

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.170
and rip my balls off but I'm trying to

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:48.730
completely master it right here

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.410
I mean I'm developing a program for

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:51.460
people that's what I'm doing with Bud

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:51.880
Light

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.170
are you really I'm just working my

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:56.560
tolerance so like if I'm just hanging

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.030
out I'm micro dose I'll have like a six

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:01.780
pack a micro dose Bud Light and then

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:06.580
I'll [ __ ] go out see how [ __ ] up I

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.590
can get and my every once while I mean

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:11.350
like every other day like I push this

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:12.430
thing in the limit see how much alcohol

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.170
I can do come I'm coming up with a field

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:15.670
guide for and it's it's not for again

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:17.230
hope people like organ you like six

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.850
tubes have acid and go to food shop and

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:20.350
it's like alright well clearly this is

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:23.200
not for you and it's like I mean I look

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.640
this probably me just being jealous but

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.190
it's like to be able to champ acid like

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.530
that I don't know how does I don't

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:30.550
understand how your brain works so

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:31.900
you're not completely overwhelmed I mean

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.340
that again it's like it's slightly I

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.380
deal with one hit that's what I'm saying

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.390
from a [ __ ] joint and I'm just like I

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.670
got to go home everyone here hates me I

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.470
think there's a lot that my thing is is

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:43.359
it's a there's a lot to be had to like

00:45:43.359 --> 00:45:47.859
navigating that yet but you you wanna

00:45:47.859 --> 00:45:50.490
talk about navigating I get it good

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:53.530
twenty Bud Lights try to navigate that

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:55.900
dude that's your problem dude yeah it's

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.240
a wild realm it's just you versus your

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.369
ego just he goes like tell him he's gay

00:46:00.369 --> 00:46:02.170
well that's home you're the best that's

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:05.670
where the assaulter

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.619
theorized that that came about for all

00:46:08.619 --> 00:46:09.880
like the mushroom cults they started

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.820
storing mushrooms in honey and then from

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.500
holding on honey for a long time people

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:15.700
naturally found out about fermentation

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:18.040
that's where the alcohol culture led to

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.859
our mushrooms led to boost mushrooms

00:46:20.859 --> 00:46:24.549
the preservation note yeah yeah you're

00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:26.380
on that Rogan tip where it's like you

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:27.849
know I bet you're glad to booze

00:46:27.849 --> 00:46:30.819
mushrooms led to probably humans Apes

00:46:30.819 --> 00:46:33.249
we're eating mushrooms started you're

00:46:33.249 --> 00:46:35.200
talking stone you're stoned a theory

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.660
what's it what's going on that's such a

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.479
such a rudimentary understanding that's

00:46:39.479 --> 00:46:42.489
[ __ ] that I got one thing what Notre

00:46:42.489 --> 00:46:44.920
Dame football I can't wait

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.440
do you ever cited I don't anything no

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.430
names gonna do this here what's the

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:51.400
record I would say 10 and for 10 and for

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.499
10 wins four losses you actually nail it

00:46:53.499 --> 00:46:56.079
really as far as like with a bowl game

00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:58.299
ten and four yes last time you were like

00:46:58.299 --> 00:47:00.849
South Carolina is gonna go 38 and 12 I

00:47:00.849 --> 00:47:02.769
think I just pictured it like a Madden

00:47:02.769 --> 00:47:05.289
season in my head I was like 14 games I

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:07.900
think close regular 16 yeah 16 you know

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.930
what though so college is only 14 games

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:13.959
college is 12 regular season two bowls

00:47:13.959 --> 00:47:15.819
and then a bowl game some sugar bowls

00:47:15.819 --> 00:47:18.099
you got 12 regular season yeah and then

00:47:18.099 --> 00:47:19.779
a conference championship and their bowl

00:47:19.779 --> 00:47:22.690
game so Notre Dame could knock out ten

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:24.309
oh well with the playoffs

00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:25.569
but they wouldn't make the playoffs at

00:47:25.569 --> 00:47:27.339
10:04 we're getting wild man now we're

00:47:27.339 --> 00:47:31.869
talking about theory then we're talking

00:47:31.869 --> 00:47:34.660
theories that just dude so I you know

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.609
what that's my whole thing is get that

00:47:36.609 --> 00:47:38.199
supplement and take it tell me if I'm

00:47:38.199 --> 00:47:39.819
wrong cuz dude I like what's the name of

00:47:39.819 --> 00:47:42.339
something it's called a Mike it's a host

00:47:42.339 --> 00:47:43.779
offense and it's just you just type in

00:47:43.779 --> 00:47:45.609
host offense brain it's the one that has

00:47:45.609 --> 00:47:48.190
like lion's mane go do Cola all this

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:48.819
other stuff

00:47:48.819 --> 00:47:50.259
who's I want to see if it's just me cuz

00:47:50.259 --> 00:47:51.819
I definitely could probably let you just

00:47:51.819 --> 00:47:53.410
buy in brain chemicals off the internet

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:54.729
they're mushrooms and herbs they're

00:47:54.729 --> 00:47:56.199
nothing there's something crazy it's not

00:47:56.199 --> 00:47:57.549
like on it where it's like they're like

00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:59.739
where the Chinese making them no all

00:47:59.739 --> 00:48:01.719
made in America by all means this better

00:48:01.719 --> 00:48:03.940
be made America right only by American

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:05.709
when it comes to [ __ ] I'm using for my

00:48:05.709 --> 00:48:07.390
brain I really do only buy [ __ ] from

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.459
America I would never be like oh yeah

00:48:09.459 --> 00:48:11.259
like let me go get even the stuff you

00:48:11.259 --> 00:48:12.369
know watch out for the stuff that's like

00:48:12.369 --> 00:48:14.140
harvested in China that's then bought by

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.479
American company those pesticides and

00:48:16.479 --> 00:48:18.699
[ __ ] whatever the [ __ ] just I mean you

00:48:18.699 --> 00:48:20.650
just don't [ __ ] know yeah who knows

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:22.509
maybe it's the best and you know we're

00:48:22.509 --> 00:48:24.819
just being propagandized but i leave

00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:27.369
maybe try near killing it highly dad but

00:48:27.369 --> 00:48:29.170
there's not too many sad Chiney boys

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:32.170
they're just working lower their head

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:33.290
and keep moving

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:35.600
did your own mentality now you change

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.340
boys I don't know if it's Japan now I

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.810
think there's a pretty decent suicide

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:41.050
rate I hope Japan they'll [ __ ] panel

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:48.170
that's just for honor they like if they

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:51.370
like stub their toe on a date and then

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:54.050
go right to the woods they just walk

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:57.920
straight [ __ ] excuse me just get up from

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:02.990
the table [ __ ] my head I'm like I was

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:04.580
gonna continue doing when I'm in my

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:05.840
kitchen like cleaning up and doing the

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.460

pudding you know you can't hold on to a

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.470
thought you're so high it's like you're

you're like I have no idea what was that

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:20.270

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.630
just trying to like embrace they call it

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:43.640

storyline hooks you in think I see where

01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:38.280
this goes instantly you got a and the

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.080
fact that you just hang out by yourself

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.510

hate myself really yeah it's no surprise

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.630
to me I am my own worst enemy well to be

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.790
fair it's just every now if I go out in

01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:04.080
public that I just kick the living [ __ ]

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:04.800
out of me

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:10.020
do you really but the trade-off is I go

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:18.480
out in public I'm like the but so I

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.280
watch teen wage and I'm like it was like

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.320
like again there's movies acting I'll

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.520
watch it was her and I at least like get

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.470
hooked into it and it's follow them this

01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:29.070
movie was so it was so unbelievably bad

01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:32.369
that I was like their hat like I started

01:05:32.369 --> 01:05:33.540
like researching it while I was watching

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.580
it dude there's a twenty five million

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.830
dollar or known excuse me 2.5 million it

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:40.650
was in 1989 two point five million

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:43.050
dollar budget guess how much it grossed

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:48.839
in the opening weekend $3,500 $3,500 and

01:05:48.839 --> 01:05:51.450
then it I think it made like 37,000 and

01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:52.680
its entire and then it got like

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.359
immediately pull it from the theaters

01:05:54.359 --> 01:05:56.099
then it became like a cult classic it's

01:05:56.099 --> 01:05:58.740
so bad but dude they so they're like

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.480
they're gonna be so bad that it's a cult

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.040
classic yes she was it's like one of

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.300
those movies people watch but she was

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:04.440
just like oh I remember watching this

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.089
and I like this and I was a little too

01:06:06.089 --> 01:06:08.310
yeah so like she put it on and I was

01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:11.490
like this is like next-level like it was

01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:13.020
every single cliche you could possibly

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:16.200
think of yeah put into a movie and like

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.850
you know it's so white people

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:22.240
but the popular kids like how they how

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.850
they show popular kids it's just white

01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:26.200
people rapping but it's like that

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.840
old-school like 80s rap yeah like do

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.590
they do everybody dude it is so homework

01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:35.500
dude it is so [ __ ] funny to watch the

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.630
scenes from that and then like the one

01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:39.700
part they like it's a good you know like

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.440
break-in or like almost semi musical

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.420
numbers at points then at one point I

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.620
think they're rapping and they just have

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.600
like in the car there's just two Mexican

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.820
guys are like cholo buttoned all the top

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.410
and unbuttoned like just like dancing

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:53.740
dude it is [ __ ] crazy it's so bad

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.390
it's like literally all those are bad

01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:57.160
though I'm sure that's exceptionally bad

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.380
that sounds that's another chaos it's

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.570
another level I watched watch The Mighty

01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:02.110
Ducks

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.110
similar thing very true like a bigger

01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:19.750
cooler team yeah like an actual [ __ ]

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:21.910
team and then verse this like co-ed

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:23.770
group of like yeah I wonder where that

01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:27.280

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.780
the running play in fact in the game the

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.940
coach demands excellence I wonder where

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.530
that got brought into like stories of

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:37.450

to win yes come on guys just be friends

01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:41.410
and then come up with a trick play right

01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:42.820
at the end yeah it's like now you're

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.440
gonna crush dude yeah they should have

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.810

yeah exactly

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.670
the balls aren't hanging down at all and

01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:06.340

01:10:08.530 --> 01:10:09.670

01:10:11.949 --> 01:10:14.560

dongs lost in history dude dongs yeah

01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:31.659
that's too [ __ ] funny dude yet but

01:10:31.659 --> 01:10:32.590
you were it was funny what you were

01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:34.389
saying about like sitting by yourself I

01:10:34.389 --> 01:10:37.150
said by myself I was like I was talking

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:38.230
to my therapist and I was explaining

01:10:38.230 --> 01:10:39.760
this was like I get as high as I can

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.770
then I navigate that she like frame

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:42.969
didn't all these crazy ways of like

01:10:42.969 --> 01:10:44.949
you're accessing emotions that you're

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:46.480
not available to you and they all come

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.760
skating she explained in this like wild

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:49.900
way and I was literally just like

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.160
yes exactly what I do for fun

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.750
get your therapist laugh that's that's

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.010
my favorite thing yeah

01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:58.989
so you're tapping into emotions that

01:10:58.989 --> 01:11:00.220
otherwise you would be afraid to

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:03.640
confront no she's like no it's more or

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.090
less like a dissociation thing we're

01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:08.800
like you unconsciously dissociate from

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.330
your emotions that are pretty much a lot

01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:11.500
of dudes do this where you have like

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.270
just I was actually talking to friend

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:15.220
about this you have like like if you try

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.840
to like express your emotions so like

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.520
your girlfriend they're saying they're

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:21.430
like is [ __ ] [ __ ] if you just don't

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:25.360
have the vocabulary Nico Cabriolet to

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.940
express like that picture owners like

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.950
you like I feel a certain way now I'm

01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:34.150
gonna communicate the feeling you're

01:11:34.150 --> 01:11:38.650
like oh oh I don't like sometimes it's

01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:40.180
like I can't never get the words out

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.800
that's like what girls like sit there

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.820
talking about a day you're like oh my

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.920
god like oh my god like when they try to

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.030
tell you about their situation at work

01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:47.560
and you're just like you can see the

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.210
necessarily answer in your head like

01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:51.040
four mile away my qualities do that it's

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.239
like the same thing when you're like

01:11:52.239 --> 01:11:53.500
trying to express her so I was talking

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.130
about that with Andy Nilofer any I was

01:11:57.130 --> 01:12:00.700
talking about my ex would tell me

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:02.680
stories and like start talking to me

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:06.910
like I would try to [ __ ] listen yeah

01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:08.650
and I couldn't I would literally block

01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:10.480
it out like eye contact and everything I

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.239
just feel like come on listen to this

01:12:13.239 --> 01:12:15.610
story you can listen to it couldn't do

01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:16.600
it and I always thought that was like a

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.900
hack like yeah bit about how like men

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.730
never listen mm-hmm it's totally true

01:12:21.730 --> 01:12:24.700
yeah if your [ __ ] BB G goes off on a

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:29.380
story just stuck in this like yeah you

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.920
their navigating a sea of just like

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.840
chaotic emotions all day long and then

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:50.950
you know we're pretty much just like

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:52.989

01:12:52.989 --> 01:12:55.630
pretty much like look I got Kevin Durant

01:12:55.630 --> 01:12:56.300

01:13:03.710 --> 01:13:05.870
navigating this like this [ __ ] realm

01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:07.700
of [ __ ] that like cannot even be you

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.900

road you see just as sn' is laying there

01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:22.040

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.490
it on a highway all the way down the

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:27.710
black dudes cars just that's another

01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:28.850
thing when you're talking I mean it's

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.070
watching these dudes walking down the

01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:51.890
even with DHS it's like maybe you should

01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:54.500
get into eugenics well that was the big

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.420

like [ __ ] crazy seeing that [ __ ] yeah

01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:43.930
yeah

01:23:43.930 --> 01:23:46.570
I couldn't yes ruff I couldn't believe

01:23:46.570 --> 01:23:48.940
it's it's rough to see see the [ __ ]

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:51.460
the crisis in in person when you see the

01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:55.090
[ __ ] opioid crisis yeah it's wild and

01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:56.920
again just [ __ ] people who are poor

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.440
it's like they've been that strain of

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:02.230
people has been around forever and I'm

01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:03.760
sure it changes I'm sure mutates and

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.420
like people

01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:05.800
get out of that and get up and some

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.630
people fall down into it but sure there

01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:09.280
has to be oh gee Poor's who have just

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.860
been always forever poor do they want

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:14.770
Eyre lineage pours for the untouchables

01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:17.610
[Laughter]

01:24:17.610 --> 01:24:20.290
that's uh what I was telling you that

01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:22.420
[ __ ] book dope sick today you know

01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:24.250
every book I have I read the first 30

01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:28.570
pages and what you get I've been reading

01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:30.810
it for three years now

01:24:30.810 --> 01:24:35.290
just more people are dying from the

01:24:35.290 --> 01:24:39.070
opioid crisis then aids in its prime

01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:41.860
yeah that's some like it's like a huge

01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:43.900
[ __ ] epidemic that's something I get

01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:45.489
a lot of pushback from at school or

01:24:45.489 --> 01:24:47.170
they're always like again this is just

01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:49.090
that pretty much very tied in with the

01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:51.130
creaking cave we're like or that whole

01:24:51.130 --> 01:24:52.960
that shift liberal concept they talk

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.400
about oh yeah they talk about the opioid

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.140
crisis and they're like someone always

01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:57.699
has to be like well no it's white people

01:24:57.699 --> 01:25:00.070
now that it's white people problem it's

01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:03.010
a problem that's like okay fair enough

01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:05.050
however this is why I always say I'm

01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:06.520
like I totally get that

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.739
my thing is like the crack epidemic was

01:25:08.739 --> 01:25:10.239
thirty years ago

01:25:10.239 --> 01:25:12.670
we're obviously more advanced in terms

01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:15.280
of stuff definitely white people also it

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.980
was given to people by their doctors

01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:19.449
yeah so again these same people who are

01:25:19.449 --> 01:25:21.520
like just sitting there doing take tox

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.400
not necessarily like investigating side

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.929
effects and [ __ ] is what happens they

01:25:25.929 --> 01:25:28.600
fake hurt their neck at work so they

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:31.570
could make more tick-tocks and the

01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:32.949
doctors like here take this for your

01:25:32.949 --> 01:25:35.710
fake neck the doctor secretly gave them

01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:37.600
heroin that's another thing that doctors

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.670
differ it is different I took my book it

01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:41.020
talks about all the like the

01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:43.000
pharmaceutical reps and like how they

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.890
sold it to shelters and they were like

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:45.750
it's not addictive

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:48.370
oxycottons totally non-addictive like

01:25:48.370 --> 01:25:50.469
rarely addicted like all that yeah yeah

01:25:50.469 --> 01:25:52.870
and then these doctors were just dishing

01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:54.310
it out well they also blame it on them

01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:56.290
what is that Markel family everyone

01:25:56.290 --> 01:25:57.760
blames it on whatever they're called I

01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.410
know hey they all blame it on that one

01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:03.790
it's like Purdue Pharma and the Merkel

01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:05.170
or so there's some family that they

01:26:05.170 --> 01:26:07.060
always say like and these guys with

01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:11.770
antler sackler it is they blow my got

01:26:11.770 --> 01:26:14.140
Merkel from they blame it on Sanders

01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:16.840
with it what is it Angela Merkel

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:19.240
Mangala oh that the German lady [ __ ]

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:23.200
knew she had a [ __ ] that's the name of

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.270
the America we have president German

01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:36.640
Germans have Hitler's that's yeah they

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.110
all like blame that family oh my you're

01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:39.900
telling me these [ __ ] like doctors

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:42.160
pharmaceutical companies no one all the

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.570
research and lab assistants weren't able

01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:45.700
to look at the chemical compound oh they

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:48.910
knew exactly like early they don't they

01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:50.680
all blame it on the Sackler zits like so

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:52.330
these companies have these [ __ ]

01:26:52.330 --> 01:26:53.860
people who know their chemists and they

01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.360
were like looking at the same be like oh

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:57.880
what the [ __ ] is this is like Street

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.550
heroin so it's like or enough to know

01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:02.050
like how they do that was basically like

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.420
um how they do all the weird research

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:06.070
drugs will have like instead of LSD

01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:08.650
it'll be like two three C be all that

01:27:08.650 --> 01:27:10.860
[ __ ] and the same with like you know

01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:14.320
spice and k2 they did that with heroin

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.020
they research chemical basically that

01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:19.450
was very very similar yeah and then gave

01:27:19.450 --> 01:27:21.010
it to people to help you with your pain

01:27:21.010 --> 01:27:23.050
through a doctor and people and it's

01:27:23.050 --> 01:27:25.420
like it's just it is differently I get

01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:27.070
it they they're changing the crime laws

01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:28.990
around and all that stuff but again that

01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:30.550
was thirty years started with like

01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:34.180
morphine and stuff back in and then they

01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:37.000
[ __ ] what was it wasn't morphine but it

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.280
was along that like cocaine [ __ ] the law

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:41.230
did the Laden

01:27:41.230 --> 01:27:43.990
dilaudid it was something where Civil

01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:47.350
War soldiers yeah [ __ ] junkies it was

01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:49.240
it was it was yeah it was morphine like

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.340
veterans [ __ ] there's a word for it to

01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.990
I'm forgetting it now but it was like

01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:54.970
soldiers disease it was basically like

01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:58.180
you're not you're not cuz all the

01:27:58.180 --> 01:27:59.350
veterans were coming back and they

01:27:59.350 --> 01:28:02.980
didn't know what PTSD was just [ __ ]

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:04.540
morphine dude chill what was the other

01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:05.830
stuff there's morphing a lot of southern

01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:08.860
ladies a lot of [ __ ] it affected the

01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:10.600
like middle and upper class cuz women

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.850
lost all their husbands and shed they

01:28:12.850 --> 01:28:14.350
were all sad so they started taking it

01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:15.730
started [ __ ] well apparently it

01:28:15.730 --> 01:28:18.370
wasn't as strong like pre drug war you

01:28:18.370 --> 01:28:19.840
would just get on you get like a real

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.820
weak solution of it once they made once

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:23.740
they made it illegal you want to have a

01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:25.300
stronger stronger so you can so you can

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:27.700
sneak it over basically the morphine

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:28.840
that they were getting

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.320
was yeah it was strong I mean strong but
