00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.160
about watching stuff now

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.000

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.399
make i was watching an audio video i was

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.760
kind of watching youtube on the highway

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.399
i don't admit

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.840
dude is this because your uh your

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.320
seizures you've been having this video

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.920
uh are you doing that now because of

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.680

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.799
watching stuff now

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.760
i didn't want to say that i kind of half

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.600
watched a video while i was driving so i

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.080
was saying

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.680
i mostly listened to it but i kind of

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.600
repeat there's a pathology here

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.040
there could be yeah it's that i'm

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.040
[ __ ] an idiot i don't know if you've

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.720
noticed but we typically have our knives

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.119
out

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.280
um oh my god i don't have them out and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.560
the reason for that is because i heard

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.880
that you have been having seizures so

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.159
i wanted each of us to have a spoon in

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.759
case we need to keep you from swallowing

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.119
your own tongue

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.640
the brazies so tonight we're breaking

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.960

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.119
my boy boy shockley dude did you give me

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.640
two spoons no man with a knife can

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.320

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.240
helmets are shaped the way they are

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.520
because it's not like it's gonna stop it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.960
but it's gonna deflect so every every

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.799

and that was just that wasn't even a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.680
tenth

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.600
of the power i could generate with a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.439
spin and i mean i'm not even

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.200

when i was like 10 we went to we went

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.720
out to breakfast one day it was like we

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.160
hardly ever went out to eat so anytime

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.080
we went out it was a [ __ ] treat

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.560
and this [ __ ] diner had these [ __ ]

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.280

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.200
and uh 1950s no it was on baltimore pike

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.319

diner okay i was on baltimore pike in

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.480

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.680
so i put them all in

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.360
and i played spoon man back to back to

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.720
back to back nice

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.160
and then but you could crank it though

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.519
yeah and i cranked it and i couldn't

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.879

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.000
before

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.360
that's the only one i've done i wanted

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.799
to approach you about one because on the

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.040
ocean city new jersey boardwalk

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.159
there's a place i think it's called

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.239
three brothers pizza there's a gigantic

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.840
[ __ ] pizza and i forget what the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.360
requirements are like

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.280
if you eat it within 60 minutes your

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.120
arms must be this hairy or something

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.200

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.879

but like it's like they have time limits

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.159
and in conjunction with time limits it's

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.640
like

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.000
that's the amount of free pizzas you get

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.120
if you could finish the entire one

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.480
yourself it's like [ __ ]

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.640
within an hour you get 10 free pies

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.959
within 40 minutes you get 20 free pies

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.439
yeah i could eat infinite pizza i feel

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.720
the same way

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.080
how big is it how big of a pie is it

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.159
pretty [ __ ] big um

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.720
i'm not impressed it was eight i could

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.920
tell exactly how it is

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.519
just from your reaction 28 is 28 incher

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.599
i ca i can't imagine 28 inches in my

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.159
brain i can't imagine anything more

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.480
anything more than exactly penis length

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.560
i can't i can't picture it i can't

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.639
conjure it in my brain so that would be

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.840
that would be the diameter

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.400
yeah 28 inches that would be like four

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.759
or four boners

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.120
dude that's in the diameter that's how

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.400
they came up with the pizza hub bookit

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.840

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.360
wang down my leg so it's like

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.639

circle first of all

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.360
which is not even it's not even a real

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.039
number when you do the calculation for

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:13.280
the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.919

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.720
like you're like ugly mind where numbers

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.080
don't add up or just dancing around your

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.479
head

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:31.919
all the members are crashing into each

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.080
other in front of his face

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.240

never be neat or

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.800
sloppy so i would like i would doing my

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.960
work i would lose like

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.560

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.919
can i get some points and you're like

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.840
you got the wrong yeah

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.520
that's a minor mistake you can see where

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.759
i was going with it i was onto something

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.160
dude sometimes maths should not be

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.360
graded by final answers if they're

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.560
making you show your work

inconvenience to me i'm also

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.959
desperately like i need to i need to

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:14.320
spring into action

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.600
and she's refusing so that i can podcast

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.760
i almost like she almost heard a gunshot

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.320
on the phone so

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.320
uh she she

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.079
tried to be brave about it i spent like

00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:31.360
15 minutes on the phone with her

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.200

like as it didn't

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.399

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:40.320
happens you guys are probably both in

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.800
there

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.639

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:43.839
and i can hear

00:12:43.839 --> 00:12:46.000

the wheel my dad drove me out i would

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.480
have grabbed the wheel and swerved it

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.519
into his cruiser

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:06.000

they always get jumped

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.800
always it's always a joke we went to the

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.880
mall and like three d

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.480
they get vaccinated against a fight

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.839
against three people like they have

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:52.560
immunity for

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.079
for the rest of their lives matt i can

00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:56.320
confirm in eighth grade um when i was at

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.120

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.959

ladybugs with rodney

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.959

dimondo just got jumped dude

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.000

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.199
three dudes like push them and get

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:08.079
kicked

00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:09.440
it's the universe trying to shake it out

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.600
of you i think so yeah

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.720

of the highway to get into an ambulance

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.440

me into the ambulance

00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:50.480
and the wigger dude's talking to mary jo

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.280
and she's sitting

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.799
in a on a gurney stretcher gurney

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:56.880
yeah hospital the ambulance bed thing

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.320
yeah and she's like

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.480
hysterical beside herself and i know

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.960
like at least i see that she's like

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.640
convulsing so that she's alive i'm like

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.039
alright i can calm down a little bit

00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:10.000
and uh he starts talking to me about her

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
like she's not there

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.160
like jesus uh well i mean the way like a

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.919
doctor would if you showed up

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:18.000
except if doctors went to school for

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.520
like six weeks and they could take a day

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.400
off every week

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.559
and they only needed a ged on top of

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:23.520
that

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.600
so uh the first thing that was very

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.600
funny was like uh

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.080
he he said that he was gonna keep it

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.720
hunter

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.559
i was keeping i'm just keeping it but

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:33.520
yeah he's like i'm just gonna keep it

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.559
100 like

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:36.720
we could take you to a hospital look i'm

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.000
just keeping it 100

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.080
with you we could take you to a hospital

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.240
but we'd basically just be like an uber

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.960
like i all the tests are good oxygen

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.760
levels are good

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.600
your pulse is you know it's going up

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.520
when you get it and then at this point

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.960
he turns to me and he's like

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.720
she keeps getting really uh excited

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.919
she's having a hard time controlling her

00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:55.760
breathing and she's like

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.960
i guess maybe she wasn't even paying

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.799
attention to him but i'm just like at

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:00.240
one point i was like okay well i'm gonna

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.559
stop saying she like you're not here

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:05.360
and that kind of like made her like and

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:05.760
uh

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.120
he's like yeah so like look for real uh

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.880
look if i'm if i'm your friend if i'm

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.400
your boy i'm saying

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.320
maybe go home see if it gets worse if it

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.760
gets worse go to the hospital

sure yeah kovid was their 911

00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:55.760
yeah they milked it they milked it for

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.880
all as soon as you hit them with that

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.240
one percent

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.559
rate yeah like the hospitals are crowded

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.159
it's like one percent of the right

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:04.240
well so 10 times higher countries where

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.919
obesity is uh

00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:07.760
higher so all right so the first lady we

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.039
ran into was like the the

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:10.480
you give your id and then they tell you

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.600
to wait and then you get you know a

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.720
triage and they're still coming yeah the

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.279
lady yeah

00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:15.600
so we meet her it's not she's not the

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.120
worst person there however the people

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.360
in front of us was a black couple who

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.880
are scratching themselves and talking

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.840
about how they just got

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.559
bed bugs in atlantic city damn there's

00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:26.960
bugs all over this waiting room

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.400
jesus didn't matter that they were black

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.840
couple by the way i was just painting a

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.360
more complete picture

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.559
dude that would be an awesome computer

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:33.840
game like you gotta get away from the

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.279
black couple it's got bed bugs and get

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:36.559
different things around the waiting room

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:40.000
atlantic city bed bugs too oh man yeah

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.360
so they give you they do they give bruce

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.039
springsteen too much credit that kind of

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:43.440
thing

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.760
that also sounds like a great slur

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.600
atlanta city bed bugs

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.159
did they make you wait for a long time

00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:52.080
uh we left without seeing a doctor we

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.240
so she went back to get triaged first

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.679
there was a uh

00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:56.799
i don't know if it was a nurse or a

00:26:56.799 --> 00:26:58.960
doctor but he like

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.120
took her into a room that i couldn't see

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.640
into and i was like

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.159
she was like can you please stay with me

00:27:04.159 --> 00:27:05.760
she's still like shaking and crying

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.200
she's like can you please stay with me

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.080
he's like no absolutely not so he takes

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:10.880
her into the room

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.960
she comes back in like 30 seconds i'm

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.080
like what happened she was like i don't

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.440
know he just told me to go he just told

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.400
me to leave

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.000
what does it doesn't walk her back out

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.039
he just tells her to go back to the

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:20.320
waiting room

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.080
bizarre nonsense it makes no sense

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.640
whatsoever then they uh another a nurse

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.240
lady takes her into a different room

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.840
there's a window into it but i still

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.840
want to go in with her she says

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.120
uh you can't go in she's gonna be right

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.279
back out anyway and i'm just i'm like

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:34.399
all right so i post up in front of this

00:27:34.399 --> 00:27:36.080
window and at this point i'm like

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.919
one of these people is going to deny me

00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:39.360
and my reaction is going to get me

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.320
arrested

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.480
yeah so i'm just trying to play it cool

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.240
as long as i can until like i think that

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.279
there's like a real problem

00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:47.440
did you consider lying and saying that

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.039
you both have atlantic city bed bugs

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:50.240
just so you can stay together

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.679
guys did they break that couple up uh no

00:27:53.679 --> 00:27:54.799
they got to stay together

00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:57.039
what the [ __ ] why did you know to ask

00:27:57.039 --> 00:27:58.000
that

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.279
i was just curious because it seemed

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.640
like they probably took them both then

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.440
whoa

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.640
they weren't there for the bed bugs i

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.720
don't think maybe they were

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.480
i don't know i hadn't thought of that

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.080
it's kind of [ __ ] up so she alright so

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.120
she's in the second room i'm looking

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.919
through a window

00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:11.039
she's sitting in like the chair where

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:12.399
they take like your temperature and your

00:28:12.399 --> 00:28:13.520
blood pressure and [ __ ] like that

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.320
and she's like hysterical she's still

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.120
hysterical

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.880
and this entire interaction which first

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.240
of all she was not right back out this

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.600
was like 10 15 minutes

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.440
the lady doesn't even look at her once

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.200
never looks directly at her as she's

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.559
like

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:29.360
inconsolable yeah it stinks so then uh

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.880
eventually she gets back out to me and

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.679
after a while

00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:34.159
like she honestly just being around me

00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:34.880
fixer

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.279
that was the fixture the most um yeah

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:38.080
pretty much

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.440
and then we were there we saw just too

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.039
many bugs i started to just like feel

00:28:41.039 --> 00:28:42.960
itchy everywhere

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.039
and i left it up to her but yeah we left

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:46.320
we never saw a smart move

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.520
and if they send us a bill for anything

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.799
i'll probably just not do anything about

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:53.600
it until they

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.039
add a bunch of fees to it and then pay

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:56.399
that i wanted to say like i'm not

00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:58.000
[ __ ] paying it dude but who

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.279
the [ __ ] knows what i'm liable to do

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:00.480
dude if you take it to court just

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.760
mention that you had the wicker emt

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.240
it'll get

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.919
tossed right out he's my character

00:29:03.919 --> 00:29:05.360

if you call them they'll settle with you

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.799
if you're like yo you guys didn't do

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:10.880

if you want to call this hospital you

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.760

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.559
they get so much more room to like

leeway yeah

00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:44.720

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.399

00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:48.240
er manager like she was hitting with all

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.080
these terms and they were like [ __ ]

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.159
so they had my cut dried and they had to

00:30:52.159 --> 00:30:54.399
break it back oh my god

00:30:54.399 --> 00:30:57.039

dude

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.240
it'll be a thousand bucks and i was like

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.480
okay

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.039
yeah yeah like you might as well tax

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:07.279
something enough for yourself

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:09.120
sorry for telling a 30-minute story i

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.799
should save that for the patreon but uh

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:12.240
oh man i don't know people ask people

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.279
asked and reached out and said hope

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:15.360
everything's okay everything is okay

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.760
and uh panic attacks are a tricky

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.919
they're a tricky thing

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:21.600
yeah you have to be able to like it's

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.519
paradoxical you have to accept them

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:25.200
but but you also feel like you're dying

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.880
it's crazy so you have to be okay with

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.320
dying basically and then

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.679
they start to laugh i think that's why

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:31.679
i'm invulnerable now i'll be more okay

00:31:31.679 --> 00:31:32.080
with it

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.799
yeah yeah yeah i mean you could do

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:36.159
enough mushrooms that like the panic

00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:37.519
attack is just

00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:39.600
ineffective for the rest of your life

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.760
yeah or is it it's a vaccine

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.279
it's a vaccine for panic attacks i would

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:45.039
say i mean the term for vaccines pretty

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:46.559
broad now they include

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:49.679
therapy and stuff that's amazing do you

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:50.000
think

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.360
it's a um a plan by big medicine to

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:56.000
deploy more with your emts to kind of

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.440
dissuade people from they're not smart

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:57.840
enough

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.080
they're not doctors hate those guys dude

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.679
these are the guys doctors hate

00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:04.159
yeah exactly they keep it a hunter dude

00:32:04.159 --> 00:32:05.360
before big farmer doesn't want people

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.640
keeping their babies

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.240
that's the biggest threat to johnson and

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.480
johnson is some some dude with pointed

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.240
sideburns keeping it 100 with you dude

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.120
big pharma is his soundcloud name

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.480
i don't know how he got into a position

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.559
around pills too oh

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:21.600
dude that is

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.480
the the wigger [ __ ] poster on the

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.679
wall hiding the tunnel that you're

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:26.799
carving out of yourself

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:29.440
oh

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.760
i think six weeks is the perfect amount

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.120
of time to go to learn something how

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.880
long is police academy six weeks no man

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.600
it's like a year

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.360
you can tweet that's why nine months

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.039
that's why cops think it's

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:40.399
they should cut you they should send you

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:42.240
exactly six weeks of police school yep

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.159
because anything longer than six months

00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:45.679
you end up indoctrinated

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:47.840
sure that's why emts are probably the

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.159
realest dudes on any crime scene at any

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:51.200
accident

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.279
they're the dudes you gotta hang with

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:55.279
yeah exactly beyond that you kind of get

00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:56.240
too full of it

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.240
you mix up paramedics with emts they get

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.840
paramedics get pissed off like i'm not a

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.679
[ __ ] emt dude i'm a paramedic

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:02.880
they probably go to seven weeks of

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.220
school

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.440
[Laughter]

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.200
every two weeks you get a letter yeah

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.240
it's like i'm an e right now so

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.159

we should become emt's this summer yeah

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.640
every time would that be cool

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.559
just [ __ ] heckling fat nurses getting

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:21.519
out of there getting out of their

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:22.799
eyelash

00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:27.120
headlight cars emt's probably smash fat

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:27.919
nurses dude

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:29.919

hostess at a restaurant

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.159
dude the emt's always [ __ ]

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:42.720
well there's a lot of them but i would

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.399
figure the

00:33:44.399 --> 00:33:47.840
owner will [ __ ] the hostesses no

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.559

00:33:50.559 --> 00:33:51.600
together and

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.159
to pay for his high uh ticket

00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:55.440
prostitutes

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.880
i'll ask my wife who she gets [ __ ] by

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.960

her very first like real job happened

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.480

a job i was

m.i.a on a coke bender i think that's

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.720
probably like

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.839
holding down the turbo button for hoses

00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:26.079
that's like that's unlimited boost

00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:28.800
that's game shark for hostesses

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.399
your significant other being out on a

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:32.879
[ __ ] car center oh sure

00:34:32.879 --> 00:34:34.399
they probably tested her for performance

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:36.240
and answers

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.599
the umpires called her over right

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.680

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.440
yeah she'll start get the juices flowing

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.640

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:24.160
then after something jerking around

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.000
people would call it just three science

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.680
teachers

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.480
69 podcasts people could do it it's dark

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.000
and you're talking but everyone's also

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
fapping you don't see each other i would

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.440
do that with you it would just be for

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.400
like the

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.280
it'd be funny hearing people like such a

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.800
funny bit

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.400
i would probably be dying if i heard

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.320
that dude

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.119
dude if we were doing

00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.760

to watch that video on repeat and i had

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.560

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.839
know why but i need to see this right

00:39:19.839 --> 00:39:20.800
now no idea

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.400
true well no i didn't have an idea i

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.960
think i watched a lot too yeah it's hard

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.720
try not watching that when it's on i

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.320

00:39:31.359 --> 00:39:33.839
it's an all-timer that's all-time dick v

00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:34.880
yeah

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.760
dude we celebrate deangelo this is a

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.359
very d'angelo positive progress

00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:40.960
we do but yeah dude i was saying that'd

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.560
be tight yeah

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.160
dude's just quietly beating off and like

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.520
still having fun you know i wouldn't

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.880
yeah it's not a sexual thing you'd be

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.240
like having fun in the mountains

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.680
yeah like laughing about the movie then

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.640
someone's like oh my god

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.760
that should be the rule like once you

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.160
pop you gotta leave true

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.359
until the next if you can make it

00:39:57.359 --> 00:39:59.200
through each that session you get the

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.160
state of the network you have to make it

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.520
competitive

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.680
i think the competition is what gets it

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.720
away you're going to be ankle deep and

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.079
[ __ ] if you don't make this competitive

00:40:06.079 --> 00:40:07.200
and people have to leave

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.960
yeah the comb is so thick you couldn't

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.400
even see each other all right well

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.680

why are you shaving them yeah it's a

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.240
nightmare

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:08.160
forever my balls look like a [ __ ]

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.640
it looks like you remember mad balls how

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.079
[ __ ] up mad balls would be remember

00:43:12.079 --> 00:43:13.599
then when you were a kid

00:43:13.599 --> 00:43:15.040
it was like these [ __ ] up like balls

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.400
that you would get that had [ __ ] up

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.079
faces and all kinds of [ __ ]

00:43:18.079 --> 00:43:19.680
coming out of them like my ball back

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.119
looked like a [ __ ] mad ball before i

00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:22.079
got my landscape

00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:24.079
landscape shot remember blurp balls is

00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:25.119
that what you're talking about i don't

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:26.800
know but mad balls

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.640
no i i kind of i know i kind of remember

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.160
what you're talking about like real

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.680
[ __ ] up faces they're like real

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.920
like yeah like real gnarly like looks on

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.599
them

00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:37.599
do they do they shoot a thing out of

00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:38.640
like the mouth

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.160
no they just look [ __ ] up and you can

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.400
throw them no i think blurt balls are

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:42.880
probably

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.640
an improvement if they existed and i'm

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.160
not imagining them

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.079
if this isn't a concussion symptom i

00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:49.599
think blur balls might have been cooler

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:51.040
all right well you can cure your blur

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:55.440

00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:10.240
we're driving just popping out and it's

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.440
[ __ ] if you see you know

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.760

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.599

wow it feels good i never thought about

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.160
just having it out while driving yeah

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.520
man why not

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.800
i mean everyone's had to pee while

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.040
driving yeah you can have dude no

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.440
i associate with stress what having your

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.640
burnout yeah taking your bird out while

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.160
you're driving i associate with trying

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.440
to piss into something

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.440
true and then like cut it off as it

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.520
fills up just sun it like a frog

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.040
let it hang just sun out while you're

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.160
driving and like

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.839
kind of maneuvering wise

00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:52.160
feels good our birds should be getting

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.400
more way more sun than they're getting

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.599
yeah anymore i think that makes

00:45:55.599 --> 00:45:57.920
something true too oh

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.760
probably i mean you sun them up there's

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.440
people watching driving right now peachy

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.160

that be the message you sent in the chat

00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:11.920
yeah smack your meat on that

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:15.280
[ __ ] like button dude

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.800
also i feel like if you're going on the

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.480
trails you could just run naked on the

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.520
trails i don't think anyone would say

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.119
anything

00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:24.240
it's like good luck catching you

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.640
you're naked just beaming if the person

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.880
would be so shocked

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.000
yeah they would assume that it's like

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.680
okay to do it i think so if you saw

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.000
someone with like good running form

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.440
passing you on a trail you'd be like oh

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.720
you're i guess you're allowed to do that

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.550
just tell me about poison ivy psychosis

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:40.480
[Laughter]

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.520
i think you could do it yeah i think

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.359
they would just be like i told you i saw

00:46:43.359 --> 00:46:45.040
a dude in full

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.160

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.200

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.560
[ __ ] ass what if he was just like

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.760

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.240

00:47:08.319 --> 00:47:10.480

00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:25.720
fair to say he has no reservation

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.760

yeah that's the only dude i'd ever vote

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.440
for would be a native american or black

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.800
conservative

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.119
the only people i respect is authority

00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:39.920

like tiny

00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:44.960
tiny like pockets of people that are

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.640
still like uncivilized

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.119
yeah what primitive like primitive

00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:51.040
people

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.079
america is big enough that you could

00:47:52.079 --> 00:47:54.319
probably find some like un undisturbed

00:47:54.319 --> 00:47:56.079
patches of you could have been an

00:47:56.079 --> 00:47:58.240
authentic native american i think it was

00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.200
less than the mohicans

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.200
yeah it might have been the last mojito

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.720

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.119
i'm going back to this

00:48:05.119 --> 00:48:06.559
that'd be a cool it'd be a cool excuse

00:48:06.559 --> 00:48:08.000
for just hawking a spear through

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:08.960
someone's heart

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.160

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.640
married

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.040
that's the one true way to get women

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.280
interested in you yeah it's true

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.440
yeah women love just smiting other women

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.640
and ruining their lives

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.240
yeah how much do you think female

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.520
attention toward each of you has

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.240
increased

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.559
since you've been uh with your

00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:02.480
significant others

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.720

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.240
make a point to like autistically

interact with all women i meet

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.800
so as to not like be weird i would

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.000

scum of the earth what if there was an

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.720
influx of wigger lawyers

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.079
like if they could go through a six-week

01:04:24.079 --> 01:04:26.240
program that'd be pretty nasty from your

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.000
lips to god's ears man

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.280
you can always tell whenever you're in

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.680
like like traffic court or you go to

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.280

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.319
court

01:04:34.319 --> 01:04:35.920
you know exactly who the lord you look

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.359
at a lawyer every single time like

01:04:37.359 --> 01:04:38.640
that guy's a lawyer they had this like

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.400
weird glow and it was like

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.319
court situation they look so comfortable

01:04:42.319 --> 01:04:43.839
in there you're like always some kind of

01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:44.880
weird hand jewelry

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.920
back yeah super slick back yeah

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.359
no they can be tough i'll tell you what

01:04:49.359 --> 01:04:50.880
you've crushed lawyers and nurses in

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.720
this episode what is one profession do

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.520
you think shines above all the rest

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.680
like what's good above all the rest are

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.640
the worst above

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.599
the best the best the opposite end of

01:05:01.599 --> 01:05:02.480
the spectrum

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.410
i would say dog trainers

01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:06.240
[Laughter]

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.200
dog trainers are a mixed bag say they're

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.760
a mixed breed

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:17.119
sex workers are the possibly the worst

01:05:17.119 --> 01:05:19.119
i have i do not stand in solidarity with

01:05:19.119 --> 01:05:23.280
sex workers oh man

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.599
who do you think is the best man it's

01:05:25.599 --> 01:05:27.200
the best well you've already named dog

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.359
dog training that's the best i take that

01:05:29.359 --> 01:05:30.850
back i hate them

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:32.640
[Laughter]

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.000
i have a definitive answer and i think

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.359
you're gonna like it go ahead did you

01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:36.240
have one

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.200
not yet uh black lady concession stand

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:39.760
workers

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:43.039
oh man it's pretty good

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:47.119
yeah black ladies in front of a register

01:05:47.119 --> 01:05:48.559
take on the spirit of what priests

01:05:48.559 --> 01:05:49.599
should become when they put on the

01:05:49.599 --> 01:05:50.480
vestments

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.960
true yeah it gets kind of hazy in like

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.920
fast food

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.440
but like if you go to the zoo and

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.359
there's a black lady cashier or a black

01:05:57.359 --> 01:05:59.039
lady working in the concession stand

01:05:59.039 --> 01:06:00.880
that's the most care you'll feel that

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.200
day if a black lady concession stand

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.880
gives you a compliment like she might as

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.319
well just give you wings instead of your

01:06:06.319 --> 01:06:06.960
change back

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.200
that was how i learned how to dance

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.720
talking to black ladies

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:11.920
like being nice to me at a concession

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.280
stand i felt the need to move my body

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.960
that's all i know about they should

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.559
remake dirty dancing with that as the

01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:19.680
premise

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.880
yeah i'm thinking about like yeah when

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.240
you get black ladies who do like their

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.680
cash register in a hospital cafeteria

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.760
pretty [ __ ] awesome usually yeah

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.760
they're the doctors could not keep up

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.079
with them and the nurses it makes them

01:06:32.079 --> 01:06:33.280
more bitter

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.760
doctors have psycho energy man when you

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.400
meet that one

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.440
every time i've seen doctors in

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.359
hospitals i'm usually like that's what

01:06:39.359 --> 01:06:40.640
they should have done during the during

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.240
the pandemic is instead of like bringing

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.760
on all these nurses just have like a

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.280
bunch of black ladies with portable cash

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.480
registers just floating around the

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.599
office

01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:50.720
making people better true i met uh

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.960
before i did lawyer i.t work i worked in

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.400
a doctor's office and there was two

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.079
cardiologists that worked there

01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:57.680
one of them was the biggest dork i've

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.359
ever met in my entire life the other one

01:06:59.359 --> 01:07:02.079
might have been the cool he was too cool

01:07:02.079 --> 01:07:04.000
the other doctor was too cool

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.920
found out there were some affairs in the

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.520
past yeah

is the nurse it was the nurse's fault

01:07:38.079 --> 01:07:39.680
unreasonable i would say so

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.280
