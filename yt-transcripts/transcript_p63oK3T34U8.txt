00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.920
in the last video we talked a little bit

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.480
about viktor frankl's idea of how we as

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.240
humans have this unique drive

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.480
toward meaning and how a lack of meaning

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.639
can affect our mental well-being

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.880
in ways that we don't want before we get

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.120
into the specifics of what logo therapy

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.480
is and how it works

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.560
let's get a quick bio on victor frankel

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.920
his origin story

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.160
victor was studying psychiatry in vienna

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.920
kind of orbiting freud's inner circle of

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.920
psychoanalysis which at the time

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.279
vienna was like the hollywood of

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.439
psychology sigmund freud is basically

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.199
brad pitt michael b jordan nick cage

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:31.920
status

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.960
and frankel is like a dude who had a few

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.440
speaking lines in a netflix series and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.120
kind of has to convince you and show you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.800
their imdb stuff

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.760
but he was still in the mix frankl even

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.960
talked to freud

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.559
writing him a letter in freud wrote back

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.719
which is undeniably pretty tight

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.640
basically frankl was on his way up in

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.840
the psychology world

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.160
when all of a sudden he was rounded up

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.000
by some god damn nazis

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.320
and i'm talking the real deal like whole

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.359
family and almost

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.960
everyone he knows dying in a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.359
concentration camp not those other nazis

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.000
who

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.159
you know disagree with people on twitter

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.520
sometimes and stuff no

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.960
frankel was up against the real thing

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.479
and frankel the little rascal that he

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.040
was

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.960
somehow smuggled a manuscript he'd been

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.400
working on for years

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.920
later published as the doctor in the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.360
soul which would also serve as the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.040
blueprints for logotherapy

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.040
into the concentration camp where it was

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.040
eventually confiscated and destroyed

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.720
so at around 30 frankel's family is dead

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.280
he's captured by psychos and his life's

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.600
work has been literally reduced to ash

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.920
kinda sucks so frankl now with

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.280
essentially nothing but still a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.479
psychologist at heart

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.240
studied and ministered to his peers in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.400
the camp during this time he noticed

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.680
that the people who had a sense of

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.799
meaning or purpose

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.799
tended to survive way more than those

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.479
who lost their sense of meaning

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.840
and it didn't have to be all that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.520
complicated or insightful

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.360
even the people who were like i'm gonna

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.799
kill these [ __ ] when i get out

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.520
of here

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.560
tended to survive more than the what is

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.079
the point of everything

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.399
type people this experience cemented

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.640
frankel's original theory of humans

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.880
having a serious drive toward meaning

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.320
and how a lack of meaning can have

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.399
disastrous real-life consequences

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.000
which sort of rubbed up against freud's

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.160
idea which was the popular one of the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.080
time that we are all essentially just

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.680
running off of the same bunch of

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.440
instincts and that any sense of

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.440
human specialness or transcendent

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.440
meaning is more or less a delusion

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.000
protecting

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.959
us from our innate fear of death in fact

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.560
freight was quoted saying

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.560
try and subject a number of very

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.560
strongly differentiated human beings to

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.400
the same amount of starvation

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.319
with the increase of the imperative need

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.560
for food all individual differences will

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.599
be blotted out

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.360
and in their place we shall see the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.640
uniform expression

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.120
of one unsatisfied instinct meaning

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.239
hunger in this case

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.400
but frankl having been unfortunate

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.480
enough to endure this hypothetical

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.160
beg to differ since he literally

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.920
witnessed something very different

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.760
of course yes some of the people went

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.840
into animal survival mode like freud

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.400
said

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.400
but there were also plenty of others who

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.440
did the opposite

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.680
and seemed to rise above this utterly

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.040
shitty situation

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.280
by having a sense of self-transcendent

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.159
purpose or

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.640
duty to help others or help other people

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.000
outside of themselves

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.760
and those people tended to survive at

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.360
least that's what frankl saw now

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.720
quick note on the development of

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.360
psychological theory almost every school

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.200
or modality of therapy that has come out

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.560
in the last hundred years

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.480
at some point in their literature says

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.840
something about freud

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840
responding to or critiquing his theories

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.120
in some way

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.280
for better or worse we live in a world

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.000
profoundly affected by sigmund freud so

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
today we're going to talk about freud

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.560
so sigmund freud and freud's role in the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.400
development of modern culture and it has

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.040
been

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.280
a very significant role they always have

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.959
to mention freud in his basic theory

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.879
that humans are driven by instinct

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.480
but repress those instincts due to

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.000
societal pressures down into the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.080
subconscious and suffer as a result

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.760
so basically according to freud we're

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.920
the strange beings who are perpetually

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.439
frustrated since we are forced to

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.519
repress our animal instincts for the

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.840
sake of what he called the superego

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.560
which is a fancy word for societal norms

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.480
leaving our ego which we can just think

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.080
of as our conscious awareness

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.799
to mediate between our animal instincts

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.879
and how we are expected to behave

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.799
mental disorders according to freud

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.560
arise when our instincts are so

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.680
unacceptable

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.680
that we end up repressing them into our

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.799
subconscious because

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.199
facing them is too overwhelming but once

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.400
in our subconscious

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.479
these instincts influence our behavior

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.080
in ways that jam us up

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.280
i happen to be in the position where

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.280
i've got to know well mr cooper i'm

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.880
certain he made a commitment

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.880
he didn't give anything in writing oh he

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.000
didn't give you anything

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.639
in writing all those smash them i'll

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.919
smash them

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.160
i'll kill you father you must honor

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.040
father

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.320
and they can bring me back firm

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.160
commitments now don't interrupt me when

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.880
i'm telling you

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.880
your father is a good man david everyone

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.240
knows that

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.600
honor thy father honor thy father

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.360
honor thy father i hate him i hate him

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.560
honor thy father honor thy father or

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.280
you will be punished mr cooper i'll go

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.240
and see mr robertson again

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.759
thank you for letting me explain

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.800
david's hate for mr cooper is based on

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.360
unconscious hate of his own father

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.680
freud said that without insight into

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.520
these dark forces

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.919
we are doomed to play out our lives in

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.680
an endless dramatization of our

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.240
childhood relations with our parents

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.479
example of this a guy has homosexual

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.639
urges the superego isn't down with that

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:29.440
gay [ __ ]

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.680
the guy represses his homosexual urges

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.199
down into his subconscious

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.960
it's such a psychological threat that

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.280
the idea of being gay is banished

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.199
down to another realm of thoughts rather

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.960
than being acknowledged and held in his

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.160
conscious awareness

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.000
but the price he or really everyone else

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.600
around him pays for his unconscious

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.720
homosexuality

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.560
it's him walking around obsessed with

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.199
how gay everyone else appears to him

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.199
he swears up and down that most of the

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.479
men he meets are gay

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.800
and they secretly want to kiss and go on

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.400
cowboy camping trips with them which is

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.720
an excellent example of projection

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.240
when there is something about yourself

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.000
that is so painful to think about and

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.600
holding your conscious awareness

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.919
you banish it to the subconscious but as

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.160
a result you see it in everybody else

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.880
around you

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.960
and our conscious minds are constantly

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.880
overwhelmed by this battle between our

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.720
innate drives and what is deemed

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.840
acceptable

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.240
ok cool enough but then you have alfred

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.400
adler one of freud's close boys turn

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.960
rival

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.880
who frankel also studied a great deal

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.400
who hears what freud is saying is like

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.199
yeah okay

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.039
i see what you're saying you know and

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.479
true we have instincts and all but

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:31.840
what's really going on

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.680
is that we're social creatures and that

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.440
we act not always to satisfy our

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.160
instincts but

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.080
to instead move up within our social

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.400
hierarchies the will to power freud had

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.520
the will to pleasure

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.600
alfred adler will to power so then you

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.440
get freud and adler kind of in this

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.199
no i'm right battle with people being

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.720
like well i'm a freudian others being

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.919
like i'm an adlerian

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:51.520
and honestly both are pretty solid

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.120
theories but frankl fresh out the

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.479
concentration camp and out of the

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.400
clutches of those goddamn nazis

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.800
argues that sure these are both true in

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.840
regards to the

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.759
parts of human nature they describe but

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.759
either if taken to the extreme as being

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.280
totally true or false

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.520
end up painting a caricature of man like

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.280
one of those pictures people draw on the

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.880
boardwalk where you have a big ass head

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.080
and look all weird and goofy

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.639
frankel says if we present a man with a

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.000
concept of man which is not

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.639
true we may well corrupt him when we

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.199
present man as an automaton of reflexes

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.319
as a mind machine

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.639
as a bundle of instincts as a pawn in

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:25.919
drives and reactions

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:28.080
as a mere product of instinct heredity

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.199
and environment we

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.520
feed the nihilism to which modern man is

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.039
in any case prone

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.520
meaning if we go around telling people

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.720
they're just kind of like

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.360
wet biological machines it's kind of a

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.080
bummer

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.960
thus man is by no means merely a product

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.400
of heredity and environment

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.199
there is a third element decision man

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.360
ultimately decides for himself

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.360
and in the end education must be

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.680
education toward the ability to decide

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.440
frankl argues that outside of the

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.440
physical instinct and psychological

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.479
drive to power

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:00.160
there is another domain of human

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.479
experience the domain of human spirit or

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:03.360
noetic realm

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.840
which is manifested as the will to

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.560
meaning

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.199
so yeah we all need to back or bone and

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.720
yeah we'd all like a raise and a

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.440
promotion

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.440
but all of this stuff that drives us

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.520
also has to make sense to us in a unique

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:15.919
way

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:19.039
that satisfies us within our context and

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:20.479
when i say context i mean

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:23.360
our family community society etc any

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.800
large group of people

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.680
who expect stuff from us meaning this

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.080
sure

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.919
we are driven toward things like social

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:32.000
success and contend with an instinctual

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.680
animalistic side of ourselves

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.320
but it is ultimately up to us how we

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.320
steer these many conflicting parts of

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.039
ourself

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.120
among and through the never ending swirl

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.640
that is the wants and needs of seven

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.080
billion people being expressed

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.080
simultaneously throughout the world

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.160
logotherapy seeks to educate us in our

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.519
ability to decide

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:51.519
to shape our behavior through values and

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:54.080
ideals rather than just being like uh

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.519
it's not my fault because i'm like an

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:56.240
animal or

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.240
it's just business or whatever people

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.080
say to let themselves off the hook from

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.760
the inherent sense of responsibility

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.279
that comes with being a human

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.560
which makes sense if you think about it

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.800
we don't try tigers or lions for murder

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.080
just humans why because

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.920
we assume that the majority of us kind

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.519
of know what we're doing and freely

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:12.720
decide what to do

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.880
logotherapy acknowledges the multitude

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.560
of moving parts within ourselves and

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.399
doesn't deny that they are there but

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:18.959
instead

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:21.120
seeks to teach us to communicate and act

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.000
off of our own

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
inner voice or conscience which is a

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.839
word frankel got flack for using since

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:28.000
scientists don't really like the idea

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.240
but at the same time our society

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.399
basically rests on the fact that we can

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:34.880
to some degree consciously appraise the

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.440
effect

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.080
our actions have on ourselves and others

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.519
a premeditated murder

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.680
is the most serious charge tried in our

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.880
criminal courts

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.519
so perhaps he was just using the word to

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:47.440
describe the part of us that does that

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.000
which everybody also happens to just

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.680
call a conscience instead of

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.000
saying their morally evaluative

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.680
self-dialogue processes

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.600
system if however there's no reasonable

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.080
doubt then you must in good conscience

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.240
find the accused guilty so yeah freud

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.160
and adler are correct to some degree

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.600
obviously we have instincts we've

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.920
repressed and we tend to want to move up

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.079
the social hierarchy but we are also

00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:12.079
watching ourselves do this as conscious

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:14.160
human beings trying to make our life

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.320
aligned with some other factor we call

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:16.880
meaning

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.800
we can seek all the pleasure we want and

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.480
if it's not meaningful it will seem

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.440
empty

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.880
is this it that's what it's all about

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.200
money

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.839
eating drinking

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:45.120
we can also rise to the highest office

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.399
in the land but again

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:48.320
if it's not what we intrinsically want

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.000
all that power and responsibility will

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.880
seem a bother

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.480
there's something else at play here

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.079
frankel states something larger

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:55.760
something that can't really be seen and

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.600
quantified but can only be felt and

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.279
experienced and that's something

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.240
whatever it is

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.160
is really important to us but in terms

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.839
of his theory in relation to other

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:05.760
psychological theories frankel stresses

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.079
that his theory should not be taken as

00:11:08.079 --> 00:11:09.440
some end-all be-all

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.440
but just another angle or dimension to

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.200
consider our weird human condition

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.120
within he states that arguing which of

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.959
the psychological theories is ultimately

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:18.959
true or false is a waste of time

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:20.800
since the utter complexity of human

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.640
reality and whatever lies beyond our

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.160
understanding which frankl calls

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.680
ultimate meaning and scientists or

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.519
philosophers call objective reality

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:29.279
is too much for any of us to comprehend

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:31.360
and will never be totally explained by

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.440
any theory that way our self-perception

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.600
isn't distorted by some theorist's need

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.760
to simplify our existence down into its

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.800
spare parts

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.959
rendering us these pointless cramping

00:11:40.959 --> 00:11:42.800
monkey things that sort of fell from

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.760
outer space

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.680
which at the end of the day could

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.880
possibly make us

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.519
feel bad and like life is pointless this

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:50.720
is an example of

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.519
what is called a pneuetic feedback loop

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:55.279
which we will get into later and discuss

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:55.680
how

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.240
ideas whether they're true or false can

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:58.880
carry

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.120
very real consequences so we'll get into

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.920
that later but

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.920
just keep that there for now so instead

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.920
of having psychological theories be

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.839
opposed in this true or false reality

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:09.440
battle they can instead just be

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.959
complementary truths

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:13.040
this is also the idea of dialectical

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.480
thinking that we can take things

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.639
presented to us as opposites and instead

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:18.800
examine them as parts of a larger whole

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.959
which logotherapy aside might be good

00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:22.399
practice for all of us so we don't have

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:24.320
to watch bicycle messengers battle guys

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.160
with viking hats and trashcan lids every

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.800
four years

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.560
frankel is quoted saying this we must

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.720
remain aware of the fact that as long as

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.800
absolute truth is not accessible to us

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.040
it never will be relative truths have to

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.959
function as mutual correctives

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:39.200
approaching the one absolute truth from

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.279
various sides sometimes even in opposite

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:42.959
directions we cannot attain it

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.040
but we may at least encircle it that in

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.720
mind frankel also states quoting

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.560
kierkegaard he who has to offer a

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.560
corrective should be one-sided

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.240
boldly one-sided because such

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.399
one-sidedness is not only his right but

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:55.519
also his duty

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:57.279
so basically develop your ideas and

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.800
don't be afraid to share them

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.399
just know you're always missing some of

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:02.160
the pieces and remain open to adjusting

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.040
your worldview

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.560
because none of us ever truly know

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.560
what's really going on in the grand

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.920
absolute sense that we

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.920
claim to know things in so basically no

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.600
need to be a dick about what we think we

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.120
know our time can be better spent

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.800
alleviating the vast amount of human

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.720
suffering in our own lives as well as

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.480
the lives of other people we meet and

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.760
encounter yeah but that's getting a

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.000
little

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.600
too far ahead of ourselves in the next
