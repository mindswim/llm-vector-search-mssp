a little marksman slingshot they had

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.780
like that would come on your arm I would

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.880
sit there on apple tree but there's only

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.530
crab apples and I would pick a crabapple

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.120
out of the tree and we have this our

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.650
neighbor had a bull and we were just out

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.000
of fire and you hit you the thing would

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.990
hit the ball and it's muscles with

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.430
twitch and we kept both of things so

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.949
much that it [ __ ] lost its mind [ __ ]

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.349
loose yeah there was about one shot at a

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:00.940
bull with a net with a with a slingshot

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:12.070

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:20.050
horse I just can't and I can walk away

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.919
from an erection

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.610

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:53.349
[ __ ] and it's kept going like nothing

00:07:53.349 --> 00:08:01.659
happened okay so difference between her

00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:03.639
again pooping where somebody else would

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:04.570
have to clean it up

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.070
which would be a no-go that's the

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.710
cleaning lady at the hotel ya know if

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.030

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.840
what

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.020
[Music]

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.470
you're worrying about like who's

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.300
responsible who's gonna suffer for this

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:30.690
turd as I can what a [ __ ] but if you

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.280
just like forgot what she was doing and

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.479
[ __ ] the [ __ ] floor well then that

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:40.620
would be a problem that's the best this

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.930
is intense grilling dude we we had a BB

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.550
gun away would shoot the horses there

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.400
was a horse thing across the street

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.890
madjoe horses great just like a quick

00:08:52.890 --> 00:09:00.600
stick because the ponies are excited

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.580
dude the board is [ __ ] horse in the

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.450
field you gotta live them up shoot

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.830

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.080
running blood dude the Calvary well and

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.600
then we would go towards the fence yeah

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.060
so we would punish ourselves or hitting

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.080
the horse yeah it was sick touching

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.500
Electrical fences and you barely tapped

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:40.560
it you gotta grab it shocked through we

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.970
would make a chain and have somebody

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.460
touch it I thought you liked huddle

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.310
Diamond Blanc at him other you crouch

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.050
down and [ __ ] gave up a honkin to get

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.760
a rubber glove and hold his hand on it

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.730
so you would not cut a [ __ ] animal

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.570
apart to get [ __ ] no damn you're gay

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:05.010
yeah what if her brother was in the next

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:12.930
room we could hear you true what did he

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.880
beat up what would you wear stuff if she

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.460
made you dress up like things yeah would

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.170
you wear like a diaper if she was in and

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.240
she made you put in like a pacifier a

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.280
bonnet and a diaper only automatic yes

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.720
yeah I mean that's that's like the

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.760
problem like you know in principle with

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.190
doing

return to the astral plane immediately

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.890
it's just the one

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.470
it's like it's just like I'm looking at

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.900
the new ones now you moved me out of a

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.850
slump they don't know it's true what you

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.170
got the present you see that's what you

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.600
know I felt uncomfortable being in the

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.730
know yeah there's something about it

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.170
where it's just like I'm I don't I don't

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.670
want masturbate to this person's

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.440
pictures because they're it's clearly a

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:15.339
that's like I just want to do this and

00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:16.480
this gets me off that's great

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.310
right I know you say it that's porn so

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.350
this is that's my thing though it's like

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.070
I do believe it's how all porns made a

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:28.260
sad girl and a sleazy dude and film them

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.330
there's like couples that do this either

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:40.620
Russian sex slaves that's a good thing

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:45.100
yeah because people enter the math huge

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.900
service like service that they're doing

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:52.210
and they should be paid for it so she

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.770
[ __ ] sex traffickers date isn't

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:58.600
service I certainly there has to be some

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.130
people that just want to have sex on

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.330
camera they like it and they're fine

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.660
with their bodies and I don't

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.730
necessarily think it's a body insecurity

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:11.050
as much as it you're just being being on

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.370
camera you're right

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.650
you mean deviant dude I'm gonna send you

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.720
some people from porn up that I think

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.000
are legit couples that just like filming

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.550
themselves I used to follow one of those

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.950
and then I saw in the gangbang started

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.100
and I was like start seeing some friends

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.120
creep in yeah

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:37.690
Stephen a couple good time Charlie's

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.610
what's that getting butt-fucked to the

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:47.680
truth I don't want to see it's [ __ ]

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.630
horrible it's not we shouldn't be seeing

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.760
this all the time our brains aren't

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.620
meant for this overload of sexual

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.529
stimuli the really words walking around

00:16:56.529 --> 00:16:58.660
like [ __ ] digital Caligula dude where

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.980
it's like you can just you shouldn't be

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.160
able to see [ __ ] like at like that

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.470
I think you're [ __ ] ruins people okay

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.050
I'm gonna tell my kids BIC look here's

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.240
the [ __ ] that is jerking off in your

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.460
house is gonna be [ __ ] jerk-off [ __ ]

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.440
you what did no but I mean like if you

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.760
grow up in a strong anti-porn house I

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.960
think is that like my mom was like

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.490
freaked out and like bad that I'm just

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:22.660
gonna be like come on dude with the

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:28.990
[ __ ] shits for [ __ ] losers I feel

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.490
right jerkoff much point afterwards I'm

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.400
like I just don't I just get a bad

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.220
feeling about it I guess it's your life

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.480
force dude that's your libido

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.010
that's your primal force you got a

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.050
[ __ ] said although I do say there's a

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.790
caveat yes it hits a critical point

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.080
where I can hit a point where I can't

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.760
sleep and I'm like my heart's beating

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.350
all hard and I'm like I gotta come now

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.210
okay so it is good for that but I'm

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.820
saying to have somebody that was willing

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.020
to do oh yeah but you can also crank one

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.630
out memory so I know cuz you've been

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.000
[ __ ] even no I can't I can but I like

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.090
watching it of course so if I if

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.230
somebody wants to do a form of

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:06.700
entertainment that I like watching and

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.020
they want to they want to do it they're

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.240
not coerced to do it why can't I pay the

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:18.190
money to do it because it's perverse how

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.440
often do you watch porn damn this is a

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.510
great debate you - I haven't it's a

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.310
great debate to intellectual minds just

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.200
battling over the [ __ ] supremacy of

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.760
porn today it's an addiction that's

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.710
you're addicted to porn that's why I so

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.210
much I was watching porn I'd watch porn

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.610
every single day yeah I don't think it's

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.050
good okay especially when you start

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.520
living with a girl then you got it dude

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.020
I know what you do and then you got a

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.720
ditch - porn dude it's [ __ ] hard but

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.380
there's days where I go without it's

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.070
just that if it's part of my routine

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.120
part of it what part of your routine

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.650
wake up or sleep my get home from work

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.570
if I got home I was salivating on the

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.060
way home I crank went out right after

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.840

00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:04.049
the feels to be [ __ ] hanging out and

00:20:04.049 --> 00:20:05.940
be like oh yeah [ __ ] go jerk off real

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:06.359
quick

00:20:06.359 --> 00:20:08.489
soon I'll be like last night I was in

00:20:08.489 --> 00:20:09.989
the grips of it we're like like I woke

00:20:09.989 --> 00:20:11.219
up in the middle at night and I was like

00:20:11.219 --> 00:20:12.929
[ __ ] man okay I know I can just go jerk

00:20:12.929 --> 00:20:15.419
off and I'll fall right back sleeper

00:20:15.419 --> 00:20:17.009
verse for you cuz I don't really think

00:20:17.009 --> 00:20:18.450
it's prefers I'm just saying that to be

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.519
a dick but I just I don't think it's

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:23.249
good for people to constantly be bummed

00:20:23.249 --> 00:20:24.989
I don't think are greatly how they our

00:20:24.989 --> 00:20:26.519
brains are meant to see that every

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:28.979
single day but our brains also weren't

00:20:28.979 --> 00:20:34.139
meant to do like your bodies weren't

00:20:34.139 --> 00:20:35.639
meant to be in space where we can be in

00:20:35.639 --> 00:20:39.440
space yeah space [ __ ] you up dude

00:20:39.469 --> 00:20:41.519
radiation and [ __ ] you know definitely I

00:20:41.519 --> 00:20:42.809
supposed to be in space but you see

00:20:42.809 --> 00:20:47.039
puzzles [ __ ] now know for sure I'm

00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:48.899
not saying you could do it but I'm

00:20:48.899 --> 00:20:50.909
saying very anti space me tell you a

00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:53.399
matter anti space bases I don't like the

00:20:53.399 --> 00:20:58.320
[ __ ] that's sacred space to me do we

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.179
should we should be okay that we leave

00:21:00.179 --> 00:21:04.769
that to the gods yeah for sure that is

00:21:04.769 --> 00:21:06.419
the exact same argument of somebody

00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:08.700
arguing that we need to leave cultures

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.259
alone too because it's saying that

00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:11.399
there's certain things you just don't

00:21:11.399 --> 00:21:19.579
touch because you just leave it I don't

00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:21.779
watch porn every day and I think it's

00:21:21.779 --> 00:21:22.379
good for the brain

00:21:22.379 --> 00:21:24.269
I think it robs you of your vital

00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:26.669
charged essence I think it's a bad idea

00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:30.450
okay bad idea I fight it do I fall yes

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.789
my life here right now my app is small I

00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:35.759
fell Dan I [ __ ] failed horn app is

00:21:35.759 --> 00:21:37.709

fought it and then I got rewarded in the

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:51.239
astral realm for about two seconds woke

00:21:51.239 --> 00:21:53.339
up but in the Astro around me like I

00:21:53.339 --> 00:22:02.489
want porn yeah man that see all this

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.529
[ __ ] program donations kick you out

00:22:04.529 --> 00:22:08.190
[ __ ] history see we can't go up there

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:09.779
crow they checked my web history like

00:22:09.779 --> 00:22:11.399
give this [ __ ] guy out of here you

00:22:11.399 --> 00:22:14.009
know Mars is gay yeah Mars sucks

00:22:14.009 --> 00:22:16.619
[ __ ] Mars sucks and we're not going

00:22:16.619 --> 00:22:18.989
there okay dude actually I well I'm

00:22:18.989 --> 00:22:20.489
gonna get you out of the hot seat herbs

00:22:20.489 --> 00:22:23.309
yeah I was reading a book it's called

00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:25.919
lost connections you know Johann Hari is

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:28.619
mm-hmm he he wrote a book about

00:22:28.619 --> 00:22:31.669
antidepressants that's [ __ ] crazy

00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:34.889
basically I mean obviously you read and

00:22:34.889 --> 00:22:37.459
I have known had I've been very against

00:22:37.459 --> 00:22:39.299
antidepressants and anti-anxiety --zz

00:22:39.299 --> 00:22:41.729
for a long time really yeah they tried

00:22:41.729 --> 00:22:43.289
to give me antidepressants what do you

00:22:43.289 --> 00:22:45.469
think about that girl I said [ __ ] that

00:22:45.469 --> 00:22:55.379
yeah because I don't want to say that

00:22:55.379 --> 00:22:58.109
some people need some sort of medication

00:22:58.109 --> 00:23:00.029
I think some people do but I think that

00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:04.889
it shouldn't be as yeah so he they

00:23:04.889 --> 00:23:06.389
researched it so apparently there was

00:23:06.389 --> 00:23:08.369
this thing in England it was I figured

00:23:08.369 --> 00:23:09.839
it was called it was a metal rod and

00:23:09.839 --> 00:23:12.029
they marketed it being like it helps

00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:13.739
alleviate pain it's like we have a

00:23:13.739 --> 00:23:15.629
secret technology we can't tell you what

00:23:15.629 --> 00:23:17.039
it is because people will copy it and

00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:18.959
you know people are using it and it was

00:23:18.959 --> 00:23:20.339
working like that placebo effect it's

00:23:20.339 --> 00:23:21.989
working on people so there was a doctor

00:23:21.989 --> 00:23:24.329
who was like he just wrapped metal

00:23:24.329 --> 00:23:26.190
around a stick and like was doing it and

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.869
people were like holy [ __ ] my [ __ ]

00:23:27.869 --> 00:23:28.410
arm work

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.060
and they go out after like you know

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.920
sometime the pain in return all that's

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.310
yeah

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.380
so they did Studies on because

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.220
apparently the studies on

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.620
antidepressants are we're done by the

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.290
drug companies and ones that make them

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.470
yes make all these work and what they

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:44.880
don't do they don't there's a

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.220
double-blind placebo whatever the

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.720
double-blind test well you're also

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.040
supposed to do is do another control

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.330
group that doesn't get any treatment at

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:52.890
all so you rule out the possibility of

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.440
people just getting better over time so

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.430
when they finally they got the

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.630
information from like the Freedom of

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.040
Information Act like a lot of these

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.190
studies and it was like there's

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.560
something like there was like so there's

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.940
a hundred percent seventy five percent

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.590
of it was a mix of placebo and people

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.820
just getting better over time and

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.020
there's a good twenty five percent of

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.030
people who had relief and then when they

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.320
followed that twenty five percent of

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.060
people over the course of the ensuing

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:19.260
years a huge huge chunk of them needed

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.900
to dump their dose after a year so and

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.220
this is like and then there was the guy

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.350
who wrote listening to prozac or

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.750
whatever was called he was like he was

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.950
like debating these doctors who are

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.480
they're like dude we didn't as doctors

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.830
don't want to not believe that like the

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.630
brains like a mechanistic thing of just

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.430
like fixed the parts all that stuff and

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.470
then these guys was like dude we didn't

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:38.490
want to believe this either and the guy

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.230
was arguing with him even that doctor

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.460
who was like a main proponent of like

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.720
now like seriously these things they're

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.520
like people need these yeah which again

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.440
by again like you said maybe people do

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.330
but dude apparently like a huge huge

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.000
chunk of its placebo effect which is

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.560
nuts that's like because they didn't now

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.030
like the data is out and everyone's just

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.640
kind of like because if you say that to

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.380
someone on them they get very very angry

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.350
yeah like [ __ ] you you don't understand

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.420
these and it's like because they don't

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.460
no one understands the serotonin Theory

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.380
the low serotonin theory has never been

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.450
proven and even to trials where they

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.920
gave people things that lower serotonin

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:16.140
they work to how [ __ ] up is that [ __ ]

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.570
it's crazy a [ __ ] yeah I remember I was

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.000
real [ __ ] sad yup and they were like

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.740
yeah well here's some antidepressants I

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.660
was like I don't want to take these yes

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.090
i'm when i'm happy over there did i was

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.250
that me or was this just pills

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.470
ya know again like you said it's like

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.300
obviously people some people need them

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.370
but there's no there's no science saying

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.750
that like it's your cause of low

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.420
serotonin having probably had a placebo

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.370
effect at least but they don't again it

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:42.150
could it could

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:43.380
something that it is like an altered

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.060
state PSA but it's apparently it goes

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.360
away after like you know sometime pretty

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:53.250
[ __ ] wild dude yeah yeah you you and

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.870
you were depressed cuz I we've talked

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.580
about like the anxiety thing I think

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.890
I've gotten under control to a degree

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:03.830
from this one book are not giving a [ __ ]

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.260
part of being a kick-ass woman no you

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:11.490
it's one where you go pass out so then

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.370
you go I want to pass out and all this

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.250
kind of abates but with the depression I

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.760
don't know I don't know the sort of the

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.530
the work slowly and again I'm not saying

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:23.820
that would work for everybody sure out

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.500
in there anxiety it works for me for

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.790
whatever's but I don't have that

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.100
workaround for the depressive stuff yeah

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.670
so I don't know you know because

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.990
recently it's kind of been like what am

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:36.960
i doing you know well what's the next

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.580
thing like what interests me what do I

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.090
need to be working on and I can't you

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.130
know coming up empty with that yeah

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.560
answer and so then that's a very sort of

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.690
you know like depressing its funny cuz

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.640
when I was depressed the way I got out

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.040
of it was I leaned into it oh yeah [ __ ]

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.450
it I'm a [ __ ] loser like I'm at the

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.060
bottom of the barrel [ __ ] it no one can

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.130
do anything to me dude my thought is I

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.430
think it's all and I think the the

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.680
placebo effect honestly scientific proof

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.720
there most of it is just what story

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.160
you're telling yourself every day if

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.480
you're waking up and you're like I'm

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.920
[ __ ] I'm a loser I don't know what

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.360
I'm doing I don't know what you're gonna

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.650
be depressive [ __ ] up if you're just

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:17.760
kind of like damn I'm on the [ __ ]

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.620
edge dude I have no idea what's going on

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.030
tomorrow this is [ __ ] exciting you'll

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.130
feel better a lot of it a lot of it also

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:26.310
is hierarchy base what do you do though

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:33.660
because this is that when sort of a an

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.210
objective view of the facts would lead

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.970
you to you know if you get up and you

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:39.990
tell yourself the narrative like I'm

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.030
this I'm this in this great thing but

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.880
then you look at facts and they don't

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.520
along one of the fares oh what's that

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.200
what are the facts well the facts would

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.170
be you know certain things that just I

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.030
mean no matter how much I would get up

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.590
and say like oh I'm

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.940
yeah you still have a [ __ ] lizard

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:02.039
tattoo yeah you also get lean into it I

00:28:02.039 --> 00:28:04.140
mean in terms of your personal disorient

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.059
but but but that's so saying like how do

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:07.440
you lease because if you go oh I'm gonna

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.409
be this thing or this - I don't know I

00:28:10.409 --> 00:28:12.450
don't really I'm always like a jumbled

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:14.010
mess when I try and articulate what I'm

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.720
thinking about this topic I feel bad I

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.510
make no sense did the my here's my thing

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.429
with the antidepressants the reason

00:28:20.429 --> 00:28:23.730
they're so popular is because they jive

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.980
with our current mythology which is

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.630
scientism where it's like oh we have a

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.029
we have these our brains like a [ __ ]

00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:31.320
computer and we need a certain there's a

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.000
certain balance of serotonin and

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.260
dopamine this is a story we all bought

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.260
into yeah no one Germans a high priest

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.110
of yes the scientific method and then

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.909
there's scientists on there scientism

00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:43.500
which is the dogmatic belief in

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.820
scientific principles that you just

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.350
don't understand at all that's what

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.760
people do with that that's that's our

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.100
current that's our cultural milieu is

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.049
just kind of like science rules

00:28:52.049 --> 00:28:53.730
everything if a doctor says this but

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.200
scientist says it it's true there's a

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.809
[ __ ] high priest same thing with the

00:28:57.809 --> 00:28:59.520
especially with the brain stuff because

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.399
it's like we don't know no one has any

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:04.740
[ __ ] idea 95% of the universe is

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.440
missing explain it Kirby where is it no

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.230
one knows we don't go up there exactly

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.600
but yeah I'm telling you that's why I

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.799
think they're so popular it just fits

00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:15.419
our current myth all we we were myth

00:29:15.419 --> 00:29:18.720
--less well I think it's I think the

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.270
idea is that you want a solution to a

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.190
problem that has not been remediated yet

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:24.870
so that you have this new thing and then

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.240
you know yeah there is this idea that

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.460
because a scientist says it it's got to

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.929
be true mm-hmm

00:29:30.929 --> 00:29:33.630
and but it's clearly failing to solve

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.279
the problem for a lot of people so it's

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:36.330
gonna take it a new thing

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.669
yeah or better understanding of what the

00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:39.840
brain is do you think you're depressed

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:47.190
now yeah and also like it doesn't do a

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.929
stand-up help a little no I think it

00:29:48.929 --> 00:29:49.500
made it worse

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.740
really yeah because like I hate myself

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.860
after after I have shame I also don't

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.750
see it as a all right well definitely

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:00.600
stop yeah yeah he doing right he shows I

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.080
feel shitty

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.429
I felt shitty last night did you

00:30:02.429 --> 00:30:04.860
normally I feel pretty good I we have a

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.440
different stand up style like mine if I

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.600
do okay it's B

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.970
as I have to get this whole there's so

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.550
much other stuff that has to come with

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:16.910
it that's the depressing thing I think

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:19.820
leaning into it's the best I think yeah

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.710
I'm like again why was [ __ ] real

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:24.560
[ __ ] sad I was like 320 pounds I was

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.510
[ __ ] I had to live back my parents

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.490
house and [ __ ] yeah that was just

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.080
riding around in my hometown just like

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.110
I'm [ __ ] untethered dude [ __ ] it is

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.630
tight yeah I can do anything I started

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:38.840
doing stand-up anything I want I'm a

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.070
[ __ ] loser who cares that's when I

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.050
went back to the gym because for a while

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:43.940
I was like embarrassed mm-hmm

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.590
that was I would go to the gym and I was

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:47.840
playing football I was like big yeah I

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.640
went back to the same my personal

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.620
trainer the trainer I had I was like

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.990
[ __ ] it dude yeah let's just do these

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:56.270
workouts again that's probably box jumps

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.100
and [ __ ] that I was like falling and

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.780
cracking my family and I was like [ __ ]

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.910
it dude I was too embarrassed to go back

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:04.610
to the gym because I still had like that

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.950
pride sure like I don't want people to

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:08.660
see me looking like a loser and falling

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.630
and doing box jumps then eventually I

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:12.500
got to a point I was like oh [ __ ]

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.450
everyone exact everything and then he

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.550
went back and did it not and then I wish

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.710
I still had that yeah say we have you

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.680
lose that yeah you lose that you're mad

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.690
once you're depressed enough that you

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.610
don't care mm-hmm it gets you out of it

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:26.960
and then you're back to caring about

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.900
what other people think yeah yeah oh you

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.340
kill yourself what you [ __ ] kill

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.540
yourself and then you really don't care

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.740
no that's dude that's my thing and I'm

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.880
telling you the way you frame it if

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.790
you're the way of like so if I have like

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:42.620
I just cycle through like I'll get a

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.150
little depressed I'll get like slightly

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.740
manic for three days and it'll like

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:48.140
it'll come like monthly bimonthly and

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.820
I'll just kind of like when I'm down I'm

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.030
asleep goddamn it whatever and I'll just

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.290
do my little thing and then you know

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:55.490
eventually just come out of it but if I

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.160
were to be like fully engaged like oh my

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.680
god this is type 1 type 2 bipolar once

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.910
you start doing that you buy into a

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:03.110
whole other thing we're like now any

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:06.920
medication exactly if I read something

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.750
about like manic depressive it's like no

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:12.950
for sure yesterday on the way home from

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:15.230
New York to Philly for this show I was

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.120

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.800
be [ __ ] great it's like an hour

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.980
before the show I was like dead tired

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.370
see that's not so bipolars a period of

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.960
mania for like two weeks you have to

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.970
have like a saw yes yes like a solid

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:30.019
seven days where you're just like

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:34.090
[ __ ] pyramid scheme yeah and then I

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.590
just meant I was manic like oh you're

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:39.679
swinging like yesterday I'm like I'm so

00:32:39.679 --> 00:32:41.389
[ __ ] excited for tonight and then I

00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:42.769
got home and I was I'm tired I don't

00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:44.990
want to [ __ ] do this show yeah

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.850
then I got to the show just didn't care

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:48.440
that's true that's standing up to man

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.970
stand up it's like the most manic

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.590
[ __ ] endeavor in the world it's

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.620
insane you leave an open mic like yes

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.210
and you're just back the next morning

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.779
you're like mom it's like 11:30 yeah all

00:32:59.779 --> 00:33:04.299
right I'm good yeah like 20 bucks but uh

00:33:04.299 --> 00:33:06.409
yeah that's exactly what happened yes

00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:08.870
yeah Friday I had a [ __ ] great night

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:12.260
mm-hmm and then Saturday sold-out shows

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.779
I was doing 40 minutes like this would

00:33:14.779 --> 00:33:17.539
be [ __ ] sick yeah showed up nailed it

00:33:17.539 --> 00:33:20.539
in average [ __ ] living dying by

00:33:20.539 --> 00:33:23.360
[ __ ] crap oh yes dude really as soon

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.669
as the set was done I was like [ __ ] dude

00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:27.860
I'm telling you my big thing is what's

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.590
your you have to the personal narrative

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:31.549
you tell yourself

00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:33.289
there's the overarching one about you

00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:34.730
and your culture like what's the whole

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:36.080
point of this where are we going with it

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.250
like when you're like a hunter-gatherer

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.080
Society it was like everyone was on the

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.240
same page everyone was chilling you know

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.039
so it was like a little again it sucked

00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:44.389
because you didn't have electricity and

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:46.820
stuff but mentally the the mental

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.010
disease was so [ __ ] low because

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.299
there's nothing really to buck out of

00:33:50.299 --> 00:33:53.899
baby no they've studied like the

00:33:53.899 --> 00:33:55.070
cultures they say like they don't really

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.870
depression anxiety and [ __ ] is like

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.360
pretty pretty low comparatively well

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.039
they didn't talk about it no they

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.240
they've went and studied they had

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.159
hunter-gatherer societies that like

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:05.870
wheat that were still around studied

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.669
yeah and it's just like it's not really

00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:08.919
like that

00:34:08.919 --> 00:34:11.089
even the idea of boredom didn't come

00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:13.310
around till like the 1800s it wasn't

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:15.800
even a concept think about that I don't

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.349
know think about that girls yeah what'd

00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:19.280
you think about I don't know I bet

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.780
people were bored yeah there wasn't a

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.929
word there wasn't a word for it just

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:34.720
guys being like yeah it's crazy yeah but

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.160
narrative idea there was like what if

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.780
that's not true so I could we imagine

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.250
somebody getting up that just wants to

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.290
be a comedian let's say and then they go

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.270
okay I'm getting up and sit on this

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:45.620
community and I'm working towards it but

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.030
you know some people just don't have it

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.300
sure yeah that is [ __ ] her and yeah

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.750
but so but so at what point then does

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.640
that person then go to their let's say

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.590
family or friends they go yeah like I'm

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:02.060
depressed cuz like I you know this you

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.470
know it's not working out for me with

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.070
comedy everyone has and then they'd say

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:10.640
you know or you got to you know just

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.050
keep going is you don't know and it's

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:16.130
like but look at an honest appraisal of

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.720
the facts which is that I've been doing

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.720
it for you know yeah it hasn't improved

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.030
well yeah there anything the Givens

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.300
being honest with yourself you know I'm

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.710
saying then yeah it's like what do you

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:29.600
do with this honest appraisal of it and

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.430
there's like this so for me personally

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:34.070
what I'm noticing at this you know age

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.470
is like there's an average way that my

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.990
brain responds to certain things and I

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.620
hate it

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.660
what do you mean they had this like

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.740
there was like a study that they did

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.440
about how pilots landed on an aircraft

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:48.950
carrier

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:50.540
mm-hmm and they were trying to see if

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.430
they landed poorly if you give them

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.440
positive or negative reinforcement what

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.780
they do better next time yeah and if

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.850
they landed really well same thing you'd

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.230
give one group positive one negative

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.850
you'd see how does this affect

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:03.740
everything yeah and what they found is

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.660
like if they land it really well

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.550
regardless of positive or negative

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:09.470
feedback that was landed worse the next

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.020
time it landed really bad regardless of

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.760
positive feedback or negative landed

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.440
better the next time and what that was

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.060
was regression to the mean that's like

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.830
the term mm-hmm or regressing to the

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:20.270
average they had an average weigh their

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.490
landed so if they did bad they were

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:24.380
probably gonna do better next the sample

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.630
size I don't know and so this could be

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:36.170
and I don't like I have that as much as

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:37.910
I would try to move my head out of it

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:40.310
sure to be like oh don't you know you're

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:41.780
specially coming back to stand up let's

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.740
say it's like you're not gonna feel

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.440
shame and it's just like William right

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.320
yeah yeah

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.609
and other aspects of my life

00:36:49.609 --> 00:36:51.890
so that's what I think that what I'm

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:53.150
talking about sort of like an honest

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:56.239
appraisal the facts it's like this is

00:36:56.239 --> 00:37:01.999
what this is how am I sure it sounds

00:37:01.999 --> 00:37:04.190
like you waited like you've you just all

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.890
do a set like last night I felt shame I

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:08.749
got done I was like why the [ __ ] did I

00:37:08.749 --> 00:37:10.460
do that yeah but that's just that's

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.910
that's the [ __ ] battle that's like

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:15.289
what is that's wait whatever you're

00:37:15.289 --> 00:37:16.579
doing not just stand up like if

00:37:16.579 --> 00:37:18.799
something happens and it sucks yeah get

00:37:18.799 --> 00:37:19.489
the [ __ ] up

00:37:19.489 --> 00:37:21.190
yeah do it again do something else

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:23.630
that's that simple you don't have to sit

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.190
there beg well what how's my brain

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.349
responding the stimuli need to change

00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:30.200
that it's like that just [ __ ] keep

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:35.509
[ __ ] rolling dog but I don't think

00:37:35.509 --> 00:37:37.339
it's like a end-all be-all but I think

00:37:37.339 --> 00:37:39.319
it's very very important what people

00:37:39.319 --> 00:37:42.079
tell themselves every day like you like

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:43.700
I think more important than most stuff

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.769
that people think or eat or do right if

00:37:45.769 --> 00:37:46.759
you're waking up every day and you're

00:37:46.759 --> 00:37:48.140
just like this is [ __ ] pointless even

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.549
like somewhere in the back your head if

00:37:49.549 --> 00:37:50.779
that's rattling around it's almost I

00:37:50.779 --> 00:37:52.549
think it's like almost like your diet

00:37:52.549 --> 00:37:54.529
like if you're consuming nothing but

00:37:54.529 --> 00:37:55.880
like negative thoughts about yourself

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.930
even if you're lining them up like

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.119
objective reality which is like who gets

00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:00.730
to say what that is but it's like

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.989
although I am NOT it I'm not against

00:38:02.989 --> 00:38:05.150
that but I still think it's like really

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:06.559
important people don't think about it I

00:38:06.559 --> 00:38:08.089
think if you're constantly ingesting

00:38:08.089 --> 00:38:09.789
negative thoughts it's like eating like

00:38:09.789 --> 00:38:12.369
Burger King every day for your body

00:38:12.369 --> 00:38:14.660
sorry so you got bullied by a [ __ ]

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:20.059
guy yeah yeah Decco

00:38:20.059 --> 00:38:22.509
what's that [ __ ] guy used to be

00:38:22.509 --> 00:38:25.160
you're pulling out of this stuff yeah

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.440
we're on it we want to keep good that

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.049
was good right there you jump out okay

00:38:30.049 --> 00:38:31.819

00:38:31.819 --> 00:38:33.890
I'd like to you know no I know I feel

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:42.829

bad bringing that up no no no that was

00:38:51.049 --> 00:38:52.730
interesting that was interesting okay so

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.440
just in here you guys talk about it yeah

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.210
yeah there's a battle of [ __ ] Titans

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.410
I'm telling you bro now yeah I mean if

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.550
you're listening to this chances are

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:07.599
you're probably a little depressed

00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:09.550
probably if you listen to a [ __ ]

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.530
two-hour three-hour podcast you guys

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:16.330
you're just killing time yeah yeah but

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:18.130
if also if you're not [ __ ] depressed

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.080
what are you a [ __ ] idiot true that

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.240
yeah so there's also that right so like

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.760
that narrative telling yourself [ __ ]

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.840
imagine those psychos that are tell

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.010
themselves they're great all the time

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.869
and it's like yeah obviously there's

00:39:28.869 --> 00:39:30.790
that that saying that's not what you're

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:32.260
advocating yeah that's like there are

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.609
those people that definitely don't have

00:39:33.609 --> 00:39:35.349
enough negative reinforcement for sure

00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:37.680

placebo effect it's in every single

00:43:48.099 --> 00:43:49.839

00:43:49.839 --> 00:43:51.220

01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:02.610
oh yeah but the your the Purina pet my

01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:05.580
yeah oh that stand up oh my god the

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.320
period of pet challenge that he's in huh

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.960
is one of the funniest [ __ ] videos

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:15.540
worst thing happened so they were

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:17.040
[ __ ] film your prenup pet challenge

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.110
marina and I've literally like no I

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:21.960
can't because the fact is two people no

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.790
cuz I I said he knows like please please

01:06:23.790 --> 01:06:27.330
God take this down wait would you hit

01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:30.780
him with just like please first joke

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.370
Ninja Turtles but it wasn't you know

01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:33.480
think I've watched this is about thirty

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.980
times it wasn't even the Ninja Turtles

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:37.560
sure like my Ninja Turtles joke isn't

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.810
that joke and the reason we wanted it

01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:42.060
all up it's not even clean it up there

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.100
was the so they did a initial round in

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.770
Philadelphia mm-hmm and I did the Ninja

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:48.120
Turtles joke and then just like some

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:48.720
other [ __ ]

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.570
sure and the it was judged by Annie

01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:53.430
Brill who was booking for Letterman at

01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:59.130
the time gotcha and never say this

01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:01.230
because I realize how arrogant those go

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:03.810
so I had the best set that night by far

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:07.380
okay and then this guy Chris kosher they

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.340
gave him first

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.800
mmm hey Chris I'm not talking [ __ ] I

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.940
just feel like that's what happened

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.320
sure so when I saw Eddie Brill

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.550
afterwards he was like you know that

01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:16.200
that Ninja Turtles thing is a little

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.160
childish so now I'm going out to st.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.190
Louis him having told me that that bit

01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:25.290
the way I did it was childish so I'm

01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:26.310
trying to like

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:29.400
I guess redo it pet friendly cuz the

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.040
whole idea was you wanted to make this

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.340
for you know Purina had to be about pets

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:37.320
so I thought this is a joke it's mean

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.810
stand-up about pets dude I remember

01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:43.890
looks at his shoes and and people just

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:47.000
look at their shoes and now I'm just

01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:51.300
that was the only like joke I had about

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:53.640
pets I think oh my god it was just

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:58.260
brutal and it was 5,000 people and there

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:02.250
was about 50 people there this deafening

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:04.440
silence and of course I signed the thing

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.850
and they have so now it's like this

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:10.730
thing that exists I look like you know

01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:13.200
just your tie

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:18.750
what the [ __ ] were you doing that I was

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:20.760
like a pup tie it's [ __ ] insane dogs

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.590

01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:30.000
like that that well like a judge in he

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.120
was wearing like a this - what is that

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.480
