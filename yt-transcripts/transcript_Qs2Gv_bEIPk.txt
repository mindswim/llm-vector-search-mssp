00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.880
should we start with the the athletes

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.860
the BC guys we're talking about the BC

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.960
point-shaving scandal today how about we

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.700
do this let's start with let's introduce

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.160
our little cast of characters here do

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.390
you guys want to start with the Perla

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.800
brothers or the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.640
best or the basketball team I think you

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.040
guys start with the past yeah okay so

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.260
it's BC so they're expected to have a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.760
really good season they had a nice

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.940
little mix of players they had they had

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.900
some some educated guys the that were

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.690
they had some lights and some blacks I

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.790
guess is the is what they choose yeah

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.300
they had some guys who could read and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.310
guys who could yeah no those guys could

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.240
read but anyway they had they had a guy

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.430
there probably their best scorer and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.830
team captain captains was got Ernie Cobb

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.960
he was from I think Connecticut anyway

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.570
he was from like a tough through

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.670
Stanford me think yeah also yeah because

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.030
there's a Stanford is where City steam

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.400
is right and if you that's one of those

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.710
clubs were like if you walk five minutes

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.270
in the opposite direction you're just in

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.500
a ghetto yeah you're in trouble

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.470
yeah I run into Ernie Cobb bunch of cobs

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.340
yeah and so no that's Harford [ __ ]

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.760
christ

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.980
no Stanford is the is the boring one

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.040
anyway and then the other team captain

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.440
was a guy named Jim Sweeney a guy who a

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.220
college kid he was from Trenton he liked

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.340
basketball he liked to learn and then

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.780
there was another guy named Rick Kuhn

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.500
who was like one of the inside players

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.450
Rick Kuhn was like an adult I think

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.450
right yeah it felt like that yeah he I

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.270
think he sucked at basketball

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.370
and then he just manipulated everyone he

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.800
was like the yeah but it was he I think

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.690
he couldn't read but was also white

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.860
right I mean what a conundrum yeah yeah

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.040
yeah

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.060
those Pittsburgh whites right so those

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.100
really cool he's you classic illiterate

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.250
Pittsburgh white works in a steel mill

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.800
but yes so so Rick Kuhn was the guy who

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.200
was connected to these guys the Perla

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.520
brothers the Perla brothers were a

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.260
couple small-time gamblers from

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.090
Pittsburgh and they wanted to make some

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.020
money and the Perla brothers are yeah

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.580
they I guess they sort of like hatched

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.290
the thing they interview the Perla

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.810
brothers in the 34:30 documentary that I

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.490
watch and they don't seem like they're

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.650
that they're really like hardened

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.030
criminals it just seemed like a look

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.100
like a couple guys who liked bad money

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.230
and just want to make make a few bucks

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.530
yeah yeah yeah yeah cuz that's the thing

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.630
it's like there's guys that'll kill you

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.730
and there's guys that won't I don't

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.670
think the Perla brothers would kill you

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.850
oh no they all kind of seemed like sacks

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.140
of [ __ ] yeah

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.100
yeah but I I mean I do have a general

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.290
distaste for Italians I really go it's

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.940
like this guy sounds great

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.850
yeah he's a [ __ ] greasy monster yeah

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.920
just like every Italian I know yeah

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.470
great on the surface real nice yeah yeah

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.570
yeah would cut your throat in a second

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.430
for a few dollars what's your what's

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.820

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.650

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.010
yeah that's great

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.620
yeah that's like so just because I think

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.030
of the characters just from the movie

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.830
mm-hmm that's like one of those logical

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:30.690
ones like like Homer [ __ ] yeah it's

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.700
like yeah it's like Barney Gumble

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.420
[ __ ] mrs. Krabappel or something

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.060
which is like how would those these the

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.860
beauty of self drawing and once you

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:59.190
learn how to draw yeah I mean Lenny and

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.780
Carl is like I guess the obvious thing

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.540
but everybody everybody does that Hans

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.530
Moleman he could [ __ ] somebody but

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.420
anyway so so that but then what happened

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.790
was like Tommy DeSimone found out that

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.310
Pauly was [ __ ] Cameron and then he

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.080
like he wanted to [ __ ] Karen and he

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.290
tried to rape her so yeah those are the

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:24.420
people those are the people that are

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.180
glorified in film forever and actually

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.220
he found out someone was [ __ ] her and

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.010
was like I should [ __ ] her too yeah yeah

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.870
what yeah

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.580
Craig that's the town that's Lance can

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.380
tell you I want to know roaches that

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:46.080
goes against our code real Italians part

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.029
of that racket yeah but anyway so so

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:53.160
yeah so who were the perfect Patsy's for

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.560
these guys just a couple nice college

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.560
kids who want to play basketball and so

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.450
the so what happened was the Perla

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.970
brothers called Henry Hill and they said

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.190
we think we can get Rick Kuhn to shave

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:10.560
some points off the off the game and so

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.270
they call Henry Hill and then they were

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.160
hoping that Henry Hill would call his

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.020
buddy Jimmy Burke I kind of feel bad for

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.610
Jimmy Burke for having to deal with such

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.190
an idiot like Henry Hill yeah you know

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.560
he's probably just trying to live in

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.750
Howard Beach make some money make a half

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.220
a million dollars a year he's got this

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:32.430
idiot you know screwing everything up no

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.470
I didn't you see imagine that in your

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:35.760
head

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.130
Shanee every gamble on sports yeah yeah

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.160
my dad's a bookie yes yeah he's a big

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.410
Irish bookie okay so that's how you do

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.410

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.779
problem he somebody ripped him off

00:11:57.779 --> 00:11:59.700
mm-hmm somebody owed him a bunch of

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.839

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:32.100
yeah yeah

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.180
pretty weird cuz I played I played

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.730
college sports to Howard's

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:41.720
and oopps would have done it

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:47.510
four-foot-tall yeah yeah yeah yeah how

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.490
much if you don't mind me asking do you

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.070

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.149
thousand or something like that

00:12:53.149 --> 00:12:56.959
oh no that's what happened this guy just

00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:58.209
like get in over his head or something

00:12:58.209 --> 00:13:00.740
yeah yeah just kept tracking it up and

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.630
then probably tried to double it now was

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.550
this guy Italian I could almost

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.110
guarantee you is attempt sounds like a

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:12.290
[ __ ] my dad thought it was real

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.500
[ __ ] mob like when he sent him a

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.380
Christmas card to his address I was like

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:32.029
I know where you live just you and your

00:13:32.029 --> 00:13:33.660
family wearing like matching sweaters

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.300
[Laughter]

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.449
was that guy just poor maybe he knew

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:49.069
that he could do big guy though yeah

00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:51.230
this guy just was like you know what

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.910
[ __ ] it I don't think you're gonna I

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.470
think you're a nice guy I don't think

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.060
you're about this yeah that would make

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.800
me really angry if somebody did it to me

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.660
I also I got a package stolen this week

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.010
and I didn't think that would piss me

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.199
off I mean they just read always did but

00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:10.220
yeah yeah yeah yeah freaked out I did

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.660
call the building and I was like can I

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.769
have the security footage and they they

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.690
go they go call this other guy and then

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.430
I call the other guys he's like a ha

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.560
seed and he's like yeah okay just send

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.990
me the details that you want and it's 75

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:26.600
dollars to check the footage you know

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:33.410
it's like you got one packages look at

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:38.120
the security footage it's like who da I

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.860
don't know who to hate more sometimes

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.910
anyway

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:45.319
[ __ ] goddamn City but anyway okay so

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:48.709
then cut you off yeah so so they they

00:14:48.709 --> 00:14:50.870
started with just Rick Kuhn shaving the

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.250
points but then they realized he wasn't

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.630
really good enough of a player to

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:54.660
influence the games

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.730
brought in his friend and point guard

00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:01.079
mr. Jim Sweeney jim was a all-american

00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:04.050
nice college kid and they brought him to

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.810
a meeting with Henry Hill in a hotel

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.899
room and he was like uh gee whiz mr.

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:11.490
Hill where we uh what's going on here

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.069
and Henry Hill was like eh we want you

00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:15.870
to shave some points down in the game

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.490
you're not gonna and what he liked it

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.899
but what Sweeney liked about the idea

00:15:18.899 --> 00:15:20.670
was that you weren't gonna really change

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.250
the outcome of the game you were just

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.139
gonna like shave the points down a

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:28.470
little bit you know and then how do you

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.350
explain point shaving because chances

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.730
are if you're a dork listen to this

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:37.470
mother [ __ ] virgin all you right mat

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.110
all our listeners are virgins I mean

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:57.350
there's a it [ __ ] mother was virgin

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.600
yeah but uh but I mean like

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.949
point-shaving though all right so say

00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:07.439
boy shaving is they don't bet on so when

00:16:07.439 --> 00:16:08.850
people bet on games they don't bet on oh

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.579
he's gonna win or a cool example so like

00:16:11.579 --> 00:16:14.069
if the Patriots are favored to win plus

00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:16.829
three minus three it's their favorite to

00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:20.459
win minus three that would be like Tom

00:16:20.459 --> 00:16:22.920
Brady's like I'm gonna or let's say the

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.569
kicker he's like I'm gonna intentionally

00:16:24.569 --> 00:16:28.459
miss this extra point so we only win by

00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:35.880
yeah especially in basketball so like

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.230
let's say Boston College is playing

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.329
Harvard yeah they're favored by 15

00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:41.519
points yeah so if you're gonna put money

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:45.600
on Harvard mmm they can lose mmm so long

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.430
as they're within 15 points you cover

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.189
right all right so that's all this is so

00:16:50.189 --> 00:16:51.120
that's what you're saying like what's

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.470
that's what sweetie liked about it is

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.689
like they can still beat Harvard yeah

00:16:54.689 --> 00:16:57.059
just had to win by less than 15 points

00:16:57.059 --> 00:17:00.029
yeah so it's just like you're kind of

00:17:00.029 --> 00:17:03.709
screwing up the game a little bit yeah

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.850
yeah yeah yeah

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:08.640
singing that too in the car like cuz you

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.620
just get [ __ ] pulled like right they

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.030
would just take you out like in

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.949
basketball you can miss shots and it

00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:16.049
yeah mm-hmm like that's what that was

00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:17.610
that podcast I was listen the guys were

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:18.569
like we couldn't tell if they were

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:20.579
fixing games or not yeah times that's

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:23.069
master yeah that's what the FBI said to

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.970
their like they looked at all the

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.110
footage and they were like it's it's

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.850
hard to tell if they're if they're

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.740
trying to fix games or influence them

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.480
even like the players or thing like yeah

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.340
it's also hard for one or two guys to

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.260
like influence a game right when there's

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.409
multiple people playing basketball not

00:17:40.409 --> 00:17:44.190
really now when it's the two no cop yeah

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.590
they could definitely do it okay yeah I

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.419
said the point guard you know the guy

00:17:48.419 --> 00:17:50.100
that brings the ball in his court and

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.620
then your top scorer you should be you

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.890
should be set but yeah when they started

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.919
with just Kuhn it was like yeah he

00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:16.919
sucked yeah yeah can they foul him out

00:18:16.919 --> 00:18:21.210
yeah yeah so they bring in they bring in

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.970
and so so Henry Hill was like now I

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.970
never threatened them but then like Jim

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.700
Sweeney was like Henry Hill said to me

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.559
how would you like it if your girlfriend

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:33.510
Morris all you wearing your balls around

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:42.360
your neck as a necklace student athlete

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.169
who's like your model athlete right you

00:18:46.169 --> 00:18:48.150
want an award for you know trust Henry

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:54.240
Hill he was half Irish by the way he was

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.530
Irish parts of him not defending them

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.510
either yeah Irish people are shitty

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.030
people also yeah also awful also the

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.120
boobs of [ __ ] but it's funny they

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.130
didn't like do crime for that long you

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.890
know that was just like they did it

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.450
initially and then they all became like

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.789
cops and building supers yeah

00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:16.169
just started shutting you guys down

00:19:16.169 --> 00:19:17.579

00:19:17.579 --> 00:19:21.239
parallels don't like to work there's

00:19:21.239 --> 00:19:22.739
that parallel story that I sent you

00:19:22.739 --> 00:19:25.499
about the Tim Donaghey the disgraced

00:19:25.499 --> 00:19:28.789
referee for the NBA

00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:32.699
he's definitely Irish yeah yeah there's

00:19:32.699 --> 00:19:34.109
got to be stuff with the Patriots and

00:19:34.109 --> 00:19:37.139
refs and right for them to be winning so

00:19:37.139 --> 00:19:39.959
much yeah I mean they they do everything

00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:42.690
just inside the rules they say yeah and

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.669
if there's not rules about it then you

00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:46.049
know you know I'm cheating you're not

00:19:46.049 --> 00:19:47.999
trying was it nice to see the Eagles

00:19:47.999 --> 00:19:50.699
beat the yeah that was really great I

00:19:50.699 --> 00:19:52.679
was on Broad Street for that that was

00:19:52.679 --> 00:19:54.749
[ __ ] oh you're not yeah yeah that was

00:19:54.749 --> 00:19:56.099
really got the horseshit

00:19:56.099 --> 00:20:00.179
I didn't see I saw an awning collapse

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:03.139
with people on it was pretty wild yeah

00:20:03.139 --> 00:20:05.759
as long as they contain it in their own

00:20:05.759 --> 00:20:30.509
City the Eagles were a great team to bet

00:20:30.509 --> 00:20:31.979
on that year they were an underdog in

00:20:31.979 --> 00:20:35.999
every game you got that wrong weren't

00:20:35.999 --> 00:20:37.949
they like even like even they were the

00:20:37.949 --> 00:20:39.419
home team they were like the home

00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:41.909
underdog like if the playoffs yeah and

00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:43.889
the play yeah yeah cuz cuz winds got

00:20:43.889 --> 00:20:45.959
hurt and when foals came in they became

00:20:45.959 --> 00:20:48.509
underdogs yes sorry - sorry - don't

00:20:48.509 --> 00:20:49.799
either no that's alright because they

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:50.909
were [ __ ] everyone up

00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:53.009
why I know that they first they were

00:20:53.009 --> 00:20:55.169
they were plus in every game and you had

00:20:55.169 --> 00:20:56.279
home-field advantage and they're like

00:20:56.279 --> 00:20:58.229
this is the first time a home field team

00:20:58.229 --> 00:21:00.149
as I've gotten not favorite yeah they

00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:02.129
were underdogs it was a what's

00:21:02.129 --> 00:21:06.719
interesting yeah so then after that

00:21:06.719 --> 00:21:08.009
happened they started a betting

00:21:08.009 --> 00:21:10.589
syndicate to maximize profits so they

00:21:10.589 --> 00:21:12.329
had a bunch of other so so basically

00:21:12.329 --> 00:21:13.859
what they did was they sat down with Jim

00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:15.269
Sweeney and they said what games do you

00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:16.829
after saying they were gonna chop his

00:21:16.829 --> 00:21:18.839
balls off and put them on where him as a

00:21:18.839 --> 00:21:20.519
necklace also if someone makes your

00:21:20.519 --> 00:21:21.839
balls in a necklace you just take it off

00:21:21.839 --> 00:21:24.470
you don't have to wear

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.150
and wait till the cops get there like

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:36.110
Jesse Jesse Jesse small a he had the

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.850
news her any more than hers until the

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.960
cops got to his apartment

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.510
that's so funny like he didn't shower

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.700
just a loose noose and then what was the

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.080
thing with subway he said he went and

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.610
got a Subway sandwich it like 4:00 in

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.190
the morning I think it was a nearest

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.190
subway or he was like going to the

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.500
subway no that's like The Sopranos

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.020
episode when the guy asks Bobby to shoot

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.539
him in the ass or the thigh cuz he wants

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:07.280
to get shot it's like a buddy fan

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:14.890
Nigerians Nigerians will do anything

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.299
really showbiz it's like can you blame

00:22:17.299 --> 00:22:17.690
him

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.600
you know yeah you get a part in the show

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.980
you're being written off I don't know

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.620
yeah it's just very you're desperate

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.530
well isn't the story like he originally

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.200
got like hate mail and then he was upset

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.450
that it didn't get a big enough reaction

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.720
so he's like I'm gonna see I bet the

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.570
hate mail was him - okay I bet it was

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.309
like [ __ ] it was like Donald Trump

00:22:40.309 --> 00:22:44.210
rules and then a white substance that

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.419
they had to [ __ ] bring in yeah yeah

00:22:47.419 --> 00:22:49.909
this anthrax like no one gives a [ __ ]

00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:52.640
about Empire dude right and we all know

00:22:52.640 --> 00:23:05.570
gays and blacks love attention Donald

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.700
Trump rules also yeah he's the claimant

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.080
they said this is Magga country nobody

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:14.720
says that magnet country yeah so so then

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.010
so they're like all right which games

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:17.750
you think we can fix so they so the

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.150
first game that they that they did was

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.770
Providence that was like their little

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.789
test their little test run right so they

00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:27.950
go to they play Providence BC was

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:29.809
favored to be Providence by six or seven

00:23:29.809 --> 00:23:34.820
points Providence ends up winning by 19

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.860
so I think the first time they bet on

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.800
the game right it was like it

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.310
work and all the players were paid

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.120
$2,500 each

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.710
which was the equivalent to like 10

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:57.720
grand but yeah so they okay where are we

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.020
yeah and then I think B C and B it

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.870
promises he blew out problems yeah so

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:06.430
that's why it [ __ ] up the spread oh

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.420
they were a favor

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.660
they were favored to win by six or seven

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.760
and then so they needed to win this is

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:18.400
Providence won by nineteen transcribe

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.770
this from Wikipedia we need like a

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.960
journalist or something I got I got the

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.390
effective games up now all right we need

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.930
like this show needs a secretary

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.660
it needs Matt in a wig and a dress in a

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.850
way what is Walker and go back and check

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.820
the notes like a court yeah yeah like a

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.750
stenographer or something anyway but

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.150
yeah Ernie Cobb scored too many points

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.150
in the last what he just scored like

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:51.010
eight points and a mob yeah damn it

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:53.410
then when I was due is his high school

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:54.760
coach talking about Cobb learned how to

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.550
read like that year oh really

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.110
yeah right before he got to Boston

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.030
College he got like crazy he figured out

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.790
how to read and with nuts and just read

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:14.590
a lot man that sucks schools the school

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.900
system is [ __ ] public schools no good

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.630
you know fails a lot of people yeah I

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:20.950
was reading an article the other day

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.650
like Betsy DeVos like has some loan

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:28.630
company where they prey on veterans come

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.640
to college they just like [ __ ] they [ __ ]

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.210
over veterans anyway they do go after

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.250
you know like cuz you have that but you

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.080
have that school money that's just free

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.010
so if they can get in they'll be like

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.670
yeah Yeah right

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.620
so the first year they tried to fix like

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.990
they [ __ ] that up right yeah and then

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.450
the next the next game was Harvard

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.250
Harvard was kind of a big game I think

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.509
it was televised he

00:25:52.509 --> 00:25:54.699
he was favored to win by 12 or 13 points

00:25:54.699 --> 00:25:57.999
but they won by 3 and Kuhn was given

00:25:57.999 --> 00:26:00.279
cash to distribute to players so that

00:26:00.279 --> 00:26:02.649
was like a success I guess they did keep

00:26:02.649 --> 00:26:08.049
the yeah shave the points down and then

00:26:08.049 --> 00:26:10.359
the scheme went pretty well went pretty

00:26:10.359 --> 00:26:12.249
successfully that's another thing too

00:26:12.249 --> 00:26:14.469
though like they really did get a lot of

00:26:14.469 --> 00:26:17.769
other people involved in this thing you

00:26:17.769 --> 00:26:20.199
know it's like that's it if you want to

00:26:20.199 --> 00:26:22.209
make serious money you have to think

00:26:22.209 --> 00:26:23.799
that way you have to think big like that

00:26:23.799 --> 00:26:26.589
and I don't really do that no you don't

00:26:26.589 --> 00:26:30.369
know me and this is like the most I'll

00:26:30.369 --> 00:26:36.759
ever do is work with three people like

00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:37.929
multiple people involved I've never

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:42.969
tried to like shoot a sketch dude I've

00:26:42.969 --> 00:26:44.829
never gotten past the first draft in

00:26:44.829 --> 00:26:47.589
script yeah of any type just sit down

00:26:47.589 --> 00:26:50.709
just like that yeah you can't even get

00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:53.139
past right initial stage now a script

00:26:53.139 --> 00:26:54.369
yeah you should give that another shot

00:26:54.369 --> 00:26:56.649
because you could do that okay people in

00:26:56.649 --> 00:26:58.149
the room do that and you're operating

00:26:58.149 --> 00:27:00.159
things that's pretty good for track

00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:03.729
suited yeah dude without shoes on I

00:27:03.729 --> 00:27:07.539
don't even have Seltzer yeah sure good

00:27:07.539 --> 00:27:10.479
all right sweet but ya know it's like

00:27:10.479 --> 00:27:12.940
it's always I don't know it's so [ __ ]

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:29.709
hard to like dudes yeah all right yeah

00:27:29.709 --> 00:27:31.749
no but it's [ __ ] so hard to

00:27:31.749 --> 00:27:33.309
collaborate people I think that's

00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:35.799
probably why we do stand-up it's just

00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:39.249
it's just you you know yeah I mean like

00:27:39.249 --> 00:27:41.109
the thing that's like cool about what he

00:27:41.109 --> 00:27:43.299
had to do is like he had like a network

00:27:43.299 --> 00:27:45.879
of bookies cuz you can't make a huge bat

00:27:45.879 --> 00:27:48.309
right so and I guess what happened what

00:27:48.309 --> 00:27:49.509
was happening was other people were

00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:51.099
taking we're placing bets and then they

00:27:51.099 --> 00:27:52.539
were like giving them a kickback or

00:27:52.539 --> 00:27:53.769
something I mean they must have been

00:27:53.769 --> 00:27:56.319
after they won yeah also all the bookies

00:27:56.319 --> 00:27:59.139
found out right away like after like the

00:27:59.139 --> 00:28:00.579
first game there yeah

00:28:00.579 --> 00:28:02.679
oh so the mobs on Boston College yeah

00:28:02.679 --> 00:28:04.820
yeah yeah and they all started you

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.909
whap it around there we can't tell

00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:09.529
nobody but we're all in on it

00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:11.720
yeah I mean they're [ __ ] their own

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.740
people right yeah they've always done it

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.440
and I don't know about that

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.820
look you know life's a competition

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.240
it's called king of the mountain baby I

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.740
gotta make it to the top of that

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.570
mountain

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:32.659
no one's gonna yeah but then they Mayans

00:28:32.659 --> 00:28:34.059
are like crabs in a bucket

00:28:34.059 --> 00:28:38.389
I said you learn early as a child you

00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:39.379
learn that at your first communion

00:28:39.379 --> 00:28:42.879
you're like nobody's your friend

00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:55.970
stealing $5 from your pocket [ __ ]

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.039
family betrays you yeah what a [ __ ]

00:28:58.039 --> 00:28:59.990
you know I think I think you just made

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:04.059
me realizes what a [ __ ] toxic culture

00:29:09.429 --> 00:29:13.309

00:29:13.309 --> 00:29:15.799
wops with jobs mm-hmm all crabs in a

00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:34.340
bucket is like the fishermen like all

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:39.559
right always yeah all the rest of the

00:29:39.559 --> 00:29:50.179
crabs just get eaten yeah there should

00:29:50.179 --> 00:29:50.990
be like this

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:53.919
a therapist specifically for Italians

00:29:53.919 --> 00:29:56.840
just deal with like your [ __ ] brother

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.009
betraying you your dad radically yeah

00:30:00.009 --> 00:30:02.480
you know it's funny I had an aunt she

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.250
was Sicilian and she would steal my

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.289
mother's spoons my mom would go to her

00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:08.870
house find her my granddad

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:11.179
my mom would go to us and find her

00:30:11.179 --> 00:30:13.820
spoons in her house and my mother ended

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.440
up like taking care of this woman you

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.440
know before she died like

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.870
like she had Alzheimer's and what you

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.640
know watching that mom probably slapped

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:28.930
her with no it was both my parents like

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:30.310
I just think about like upping her

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:34.140
medication and hope and she [ __ ] dies

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:46.390
before she had Alzheimer's she's gotta

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:50.380
go and then you get her husband to kill

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:55.930
her she trusts him yeah how do you

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.280
[ __ ] live like that hey it's fun baby

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.720
that's why they make all the TV shows

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.900
and movies about us what's life without

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:10.000
a little bit of treachery she and I

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.380
never really thought about that until

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.650
today

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:18.590
[Laughter]

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.690
sounds like Rick James in these

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.690
interviews just like just incoherent but

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:27.460
he would turn on everyone in there yeah

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.020
and then at one point they when they

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.340
start working with Massie yeah Maisie

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.310

[Laughter]

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:55.690
double-cross everybody what a lonely way

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.820
to live but it's yeah but listen I think

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.740

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.790

full crab bucket mentality yeah boy but

00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:12.769
what but is any race loyal to each other

00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:15.470
I don't think so I think they're pretty

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.139
loyal to each other yeah the Chinese I

00:33:18.139 --> 00:33:21.799
guess yeah yeah the Germans were for a

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:25.509
little while yeah they stick together

00:33:28.179 --> 00:33:30.799
stick together at all but that's like

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:32.419
that's just a different way to live your

00:33:32.419 --> 00:33:34.190
life you know every man's an island

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:36.440
right king of the hill yeah

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.080
king of the mountain baby it's the

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.350
strongest anyway and then also in that

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.179
34 30 documentary there's a scene so I

00:33:44.179 --> 00:33:45.619
mean I'm doing what I just yell at you

00:33:45.619 --> 00:33:47.960
for doing but at the end worth Henry

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.549
Hill gets reunited with Phil Maisie and

00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:55.609
he's like yeah I'm sorry that I ran so I

00:33:55.609 --> 00:33:57.350
guess it's just like it's just what

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.119
happens anyway so the scheme is going

00:33:59.119 --> 00:33:59.869
pretty well

00:33:59.869 --> 00:34:03.830

who they get to do their like dirty work

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.250

00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:59.980

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.970
the best old people were the best

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:12.620

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:14.360
price

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.100
but they the sales guys hated when we

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.540
would go to Indian neighborhoods because

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.280
they sign up for the fruit thing and

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.220

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.290
Honda Odyssey oh yeah I love veins why

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.240

I like Indian I like Indians too that's

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.710
a group that kind of sticks together

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:06.350
well India the country or Native

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:11.930
Americans Native Americans all coming by

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:24.890
Honda Odysseys machine Jesus Christ you

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.810
know like I would stereotype people

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:28.910
based on whatever they were listening to

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:31.850
on the radio oh yeah yeah like you know

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.680
classical music was like that could be a

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.050
five dollar tipper but like hip-hop was

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:38.720
never anything more than a dollar yeah

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.610
I'm pretty good at being racist in cars

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:41.050
too

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:45.010
[Laughter]

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.910

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:10.040
two or three years old with [ __ ] up I

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.600

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:38.180
piece of [ __ ] here some scumbag and

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.940

auction one summer and I had to clean

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:45.860
cars that was my job to clean out the

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.650
inside of [ __ ] repo'd cars yeah oh

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:51.380
yeah they were the grossest [ __ ] cars

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.350
these are losers right that were shitty

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.450
enough to get their car repossessed yeah

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:59.720
yeah so it's like dude diapers like used

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.940
condoms that was gonna feel bad like it

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:12.380
was like framed Dodge Chargers this

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.550
classic black dude cars all get repo'd

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:25.250
cheese by the whites come on down to

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:36.100
Vinnie's Auto and Auto previously owned

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:50.830
[Laughter]

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:53.780
all right so then in February 1979 BC

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.160
was scheduled to play their rival holy

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.020
cross the game was nationally televised

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.730
and respected the bets would be placed

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.830
the conspiracy is bet on holy cross to

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:02.480
win by a margin bigger than the points

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.880
pray which was seven

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.859
only cross 1 by 2 points with Ernie Cobb

00:41:05.859 --> 00:41:07.690
scoring 8 points in the final minutes of

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:10.119
the game and everyone watching lost a

00:41:10.119 --> 00:41:11.079
lot of money

00:41:11.079 --> 00:41:14.289
Henry Hill was watching the game with

00:41:14.289 --> 00:41:16.539
Jimmy Burke at his Howard Beach home and

00:41:16.539 --> 00:41:18.460
he said Jimmy Burke was so mad he put

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.190
his foot through the TV because he lost

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.960
$50,000 which was the equivalent to a

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.140
hundred seventy two thousand dollars

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:29.170
today that's bad I mean I would probably

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.990
put my foot through the TV - this was a

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.500
tube TV so this guy had a really strong

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:39.970
Irish foot Hill told Burke he wanted to

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:41.289
fly up to Boston he was like you better

00:41:41.289 --> 00:41:43.180
go see those kids but nothing happened

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:45.910
the scheme all ended on an unsuccessful

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.519
note gonna coupe that music right oh

00:41:48.519 --> 00:41:49.269
yeah

00:41:49.269 --> 00:41:51.970
scheme ended on an unsuccessful note but

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:55.809
Henry Hill allegedly cleared $100,000

00:41:55.809 --> 00:41:57.160
which was three hundred forty two

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.960
thousand today with some of the higher

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.910
ups like Paul Vario making about two

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:02.890
hundred fifty thousand which was about

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.599
eight hundred sixty-three thousand today

00:42:04.599 --> 00:42:06.039
so that was like I think that was total

00:42:06.039 --> 00:42:08.619
what they made so they came out on top

00:42:08.619 --> 00:42:10.720
you know spent a little made a little

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.910
but I mean they won four they lost three

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:29.910
and push - that's a bunch of games yeah

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.730
yeah so then so then that was it

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:35.769
everything just kind of like everything

00:42:35.769 --> 00:42:38.740
just kind of fizzled out I'm sure Jim

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.609
Sweeney thought that he was okay and

00:42:41.609 --> 00:42:45.759
things wouldn't resurface for a while

00:42:45.759 --> 00:42:47.710
guys we're gonna take a quick little

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:49.390
break and then we'll be back with the

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:53.279
rest of the story on the sit down

00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.010
you

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:02.959
[Music]

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.040
you

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:19.119
all right come on let's come back as

00:43:19.119 --> 00:43:22.450
it's long this song is great there's a

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:25.160
hot song and I can't stand Hip Hop

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:25.350
[Music]

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:31.450
[Laughter]

00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:36.339
researching looking at different making

00:43:36.339 --> 00:43:43.510
our doggie big all right let's take a

00:43:43.510 --> 00:44:07.480
break crazy people Michael Brooks does

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.640
that with his [ __ ] yeah also Michael

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:18.130
stop doing that you [ __ ] cheat at the

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:20.319
Michael Brooks and all that and the

00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:21.839
Carribean women that he had sex with

00:44:21.839 --> 00:44:29.069
alright alright so in 1980 Henry Hill so

00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:32.710
in 1980 everyone's the law is coming

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:34.299
down on Jimmy Burke for Lufthansa Jimmy

00:44:34.299 --> 00:44:36.099
Burke is killing the Lufthansa heist

00:44:36.099 --> 00:44:39.059
when they robbed the airline and

00:44:39.059 --> 00:44:41.049
everybody's coming the law is coming

00:44:41.049 --> 00:44:42.220
down and Jimmy Burke and he's killing

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.839
everybody that's connected to the

00:44:43.839 --> 00:44:46.299
robbery because like a typical Irish see

00:44:46.299 --> 00:44:48.339
Irish people betray each other too but I

00:44:48.339 --> 00:44:50.400
guess he learned it from the Italians

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.869
he's killing everyone who's connected to

00:44:52.869 --> 00:44:55.240
Lufthansa and then Henry Hill gets

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.880
pinched for for drug trafficking which

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.369
as we know is highly forbidden by

00:45:00.369 --> 00:45:02.859
organized crime because uh because of

00:45:02.859 --> 00:45:06.160
the [ __ ] charges the long sentences

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.599
so Henry Hill thought he was getting

00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:10.109
busted for Lufthansa but it was for

00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:16.539
doing drugs then I think so so he

00:45:16.539 --> 00:45:19.839
realizes that he's gonna be he's gonna

00:45:19.839 --> 00:45:21.640
be killed if he gets if he goes out on

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.180
the street because he was asked not to

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:28.029
do to deal drugs and he did it he did

00:45:28.029 --> 00:45:29.980
something else to he like I think

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.240
me probably wanted to kill him for

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.609
Lufthansa which they never really make

00:45:33.609 --> 00:45:35.859
that clear in Goodfellas either cuz

00:45:35.859 --> 00:45:37.810
Henry Hill says in Goodfellas like aw it

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:40.060
had nothing to do with me yeah but I

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.640
don't know I haven't seen the movie

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.660
enough I can't believe they left out

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.119
Paulie [ __ ] Karen yeah over a good

00:45:49.119 --> 00:45:56.080

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.530
so there's a scene in there's a scene in

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:07.630
Goodfellas where Henry Hill is becoming

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:09.850
a witness and he's got Karen there cuz

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:11.350

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:14.260
protection too but with it all reveal in

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:15.640
that movie is that he actually had two

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.710
girlfriends in the other room that he

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:20.200

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.820
arrangement just multiple women yeah and

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:32.740
there there's there's like a rank you

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.900
know like almost like it's an Applebee's

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.940
franchise and you have your GM your

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.830

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.480
you know women don't understand no they

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.850
do get women to do that

the law classroom together then another

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:09.940

natural situation imaginable yeah I mean

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:29.830
we've talked about this before but like

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:31.540
I think that's a good system you have

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:34.600
like your rank of women so one lives in

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.180
the bed with you lives in the [ __ ]

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.390
you know house one you share you share a

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:43.240
bed with in the guest room she's like a

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.130
number she's like a curvier woman who

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:47.700
just needs to you know

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.320
yeah well these [ __ ] can leave

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.710
whenever they want they're replaced and

00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:55.960
then you have like a like a younger girl

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.570

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:00.460

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.330
clean I gotta be honest with you this

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:11.830
definitely has been a method throughout

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:16.750
human history we should research that

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:21.960
though do an R Kelly episode but slaves

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:29.350

cool for the same thing with Jimmy yeah

00:50:57.619 --> 00:51:00.559
they make Jimmy [ __ ] DeNiro mm-hmm

00:51:00.559 --> 00:51:02.539
Jimmy was a [ __ ] guy that was

00:51:02.539 --> 00:51:05.209
attacking people yeah it was dead

00:51:05.209 --> 00:51:07.130
clearly he was the smarter one of the

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:09.349
group right but he was also a murderer

00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:12.410
yeah that a bunch of wops would call and

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:13.999
be like hey can you kill this person for

00:51:13.999 --> 00:51:16.489
us hmm maybe I get no problem yeah

00:51:16.489 --> 00:51:18.920
you're dumb right he was dumb

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.289
right he was not too near oh that's not

00:51:21.289 --> 00:51:22.729
a good movie either if you're just

00:51:22.729 --> 00:51:29.299
casting a bunch of like we should Rob

00:51:29.299 --> 00:51:31.609
the airplane but but it's hard it's hard

00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:34.369
to like make a movie about stupid people

00:51:34.369 --> 00:51:37.670
I think right cuz Sopranos is

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:39.769
essentially about stupid people it's a

00:51:39.769 --> 00:51:41.630
smart that's great but it's a smart

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:44.269
stupid people yeah but but then here's a

00:51:44.269 --> 00:51:46.849
stupid people watch it they like it no

00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:49.029
they go yeah exactly

00:51:49.029 --> 00:51:53.480
now you gotta disrespect

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.130
you know you have to you have to put in

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.080
little analogies here and there for like

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.480
oh the broken shoes an analogy for his

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.840
life or we're you know just like subtle

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:05.900
details first you Matthew Anderson's

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:13.490
directorial debut broken shoe broke the

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:18.920
shootie kit it's like a black and white

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:24.320
movie in color and Matt's movie yeah

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.260
you're a genius mad [ __ ] its cinematic

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:32.210
genius yes oh Henry Hill gives everybody

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:35.119
up the grand jury indicted spark film AZ

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:38.510
Rick Kuhn the perla brothers on the

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:40.310
basis of testimony given by a hill Hill

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:42.200
was named as a co-conspirator but not

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.090
one of the defendants and the

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:45.830
prosecution offered phone records a

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:47.000
detailed communication between

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.480
conspirators during the 1978-79 season

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:51.680
along with records from Western Union

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.660
and various hotels which corroborated

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:57.109
government testimony so yeah usually

00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:59.090
what happens is you know the government

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:01.580
makes a deal with some some very bad

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.890
person gets off in exchange for you know

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:07.490
information you know to get other people

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:09.859
so there's a lot of mass murderers

00:53:09.859 --> 00:53:13.340
walking around yeah they do that yeah

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.840
they probably shouldn't do that

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.940
yeah but then how else are they gonna

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:19.790
just [ __ ] kill them just executions

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:21.380
get them dude yeah you know they're

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.270
doing it you know get them right right

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:26.090
get those [ __ ] wops dude round them up

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.250
yeah you would think why doesn't the FBI

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:30.140
just have like hit squads or something

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:35.300
they probably just go kill him and then

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:36.680
be like we don't know who did it was

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.880
probably one of the other guys but they

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.310
do that sometimes yeah just be like we

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:42.050
gotta put it [ __ ] into this guy shoot

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:43.580
him I wonder if they you know they're

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.180
like the mob took him out yeah

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:49.200
why didn't she you should run the FBI

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:55.370
[Laughter]

00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:01.910
just kill the wops approach you know

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:04.190
before before Shane Gillis directed the

00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:05.250
FBI

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:06.990
they used to this is the FBI director

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:10.050
normally Irish like there's like some

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:13.320
quote from sessions being like you could

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.060
always dress the Irish sir they were

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:43.890
drunk guy in politics just an hour

00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:48.480
he's like Maniscalco at this point same

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.920
thing five minutes into every single one

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.420
he's like look at the press back there

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:54.000
boo them like I figured out it set yeah

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.550
he has a set oh yeah yeah then he calls

00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:58.170
like what's her name Elizabeth Warren

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:00.420

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:10.620
just I'm scared cuz it's like it I mean

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.450
if this was the March Madness

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.040
competition at Caroline's he would

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.980
totally he would take it who's gonna

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.310
who's gonna beat him no one that's what

00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:22.110
I'm sitting there with my friends we

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:23.940

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.620
Donald Trump is a [ __ ] [ __ ] I was

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:30.840

her right now dude he's 72 73 yeah

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.200
but [ __ ] people on Twitter I think

00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.730
there was like Howard Schultz said

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:01.350
something about like he was like I know

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:03.060
I'm not the smartest guy in the room but

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:04.290
I always picked people around me and

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:06.450
then Trump was like self-described not

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:09.140
smartest guy

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.970
yeah if Trump followed this girl yeah

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:19.710
and then what the hell are you gonna say

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:21.660
oh yeah it seems like I mean I saw a

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:24.269
quote from like Bernini quote to eat him

00:56:24.269 --> 00:56:25.740
and he was like it's funny that Donald

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.019
Trump is a fraud he called that like

00:56:28.019 --> 00:56:30.900
that was like the most that was the most

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:33.269
aggressive comeback that I've seen from

00:56:33.269 --> 00:56:35.339
most politicians everybody else like

00:56:35.339 --> 00:56:37.319

00:56:37.319 --> 00:56:38.339
everyone's like taking the high ground

00:56:38.339 --> 00:56:41.819

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:04.759
of funny

00:57:04.759 --> 00:57:08.009
clover chart is the closest one we were

00:57:08.009 --> 00:57:10.319
talking about it a little bit that's

00:57:10.319 --> 00:57:11.999
trying to recycle when it is Matt

00:57:11.999 --> 00:57:13.769

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:21.420
beat Trump right we don't need a [ __ ]

00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:23.819

00:57:23.819 --> 00:57:28.589
threw her iPad oh I don't know about her

00:57:28.589 --> 00:57:30.239
but she sounds like the right person

00:57:30.239 --> 00:57:45.599
yeah yeah yeah and then I was talking to

00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:49.410
uh Gail Bennington and she was like cuz

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:51.509

she threw binders at her staff and Gail

00:57:54.119 --> 00:57:55.650
was like if that was a man nobody would

00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:57.480
care like I don't know I think they

00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.759

eight months but I mean hearing that ten

00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:59.300

in prison now he's kind of like a scared

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:06.440
straight speaker he's like that was the

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.150
funniest [ __ ] thing about middle

people I'm sure Philly they musta done

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.740

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:14.480
losers on the planet to talk to your

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.240

he's a guy's just read your Bible okay

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:11.960
good place to start the book of John

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.330
there's a lot of good stuff in there but

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:15.890
he's like he's like talking about how

01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:18.500
like some girl went to a party and did a

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.980
quaalude

01:00:21.709 --> 01:00:23.279
so scared

01:00:23.279 --> 01:00:27.359
I'd be so scared and uh and and I'm like

01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:29.400
raising my head like so how do you look

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.469
I guess my voice hadn't changed yet I'm

01:00:31.469 --> 01:00:39.630
like very waffling so what do I gotta do

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:43.349
to avoid the situation I was like I was

01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:45.630
a huge like gullible [ __ ] of course you

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:47.339
know thought like you're gonna be

01:00:47.339 --> 01:00:50.249
presented with these situations ever you

01:00:50.249 --> 01:00:51.599
know every day you're like and then he

01:00:51.599 --> 01:00:54.029
goes he happened to prison 11 times the

01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:57.119
last time and he starts to cry he's like

01:00:57.119 --> 01:01:02.819
was murder one him and a bunch of bikers

01:01:02.819 --> 01:01:04.619
like sir have this guy beaten to death

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:08.009
with like them off his bike just kill

01:01:08.009 --> 01:01:38.329
them yeah come in in the classroom yeah

01:01:43.360 --> 01:02:17.410
[Laughter]

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:23.480
[Laughter]

01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:34.209
[Music]

01:02:40.339 --> 01:02:51.690
my uncle died their body was you gotta

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:53.279
keep that that's gonna follow you to

01:02:53.279 --> 01:03:15.599
high school at least three bucks anyway

01:03:15.599 --> 01:03:17.759
so yeah but they could tell that Sweeney

01:03:17.759 --> 01:03:20.190
wasn't really a willing participant I

01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:21.900
guess they thought they they realized

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.450
they couldn't prosecute him I mean he

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:25.769
probably did take some money into shape

01:03:25.769 --> 01:03:28.259
points and then Ernie Cobb you denies

01:03:28.259 --> 01:03:30.509
yeah he denies it that was really sad

01:03:30.509 --> 01:03:31.920
because Ernie Cobb was a guy all he ever

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.060
wanted to do was play basketball and

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:39.130
[Laughter]

01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:43.069
[Music]

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:45.329
right well I'm sure you liked other

01:03:45.329 --> 01:03:47.069
stuff I'm sure he had other dimensions

01:03:47.069 --> 01:03:51.630
to his personality all Ernie Cobb wanted

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:59.970
to do was [ __ ] white women and he was

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.799
really good and then and then at the so

01:04:01.799 --> 01:04:03.420
at the time of the investigation he was

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.190
trying out for the New Jersey Nets and

01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:06.210
the Nets

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:07.950
released them didn't say why but they

01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:09.210
assumed that was because he might have

01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:10.259
been involved in this point shaving

01:04:10.259 --> 01:04:12.630
thing allegedly Rick Kuhn gave his

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:16.410
girlfriend gave his girlfriend an

01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:19.799
envelope with $1,000 in it and that's

01:04:19.799 --> 01:04:21.210
kind of like the only evidence is there

01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:22.049
any Cobb was like I'll take a

01:04:22.049 --> 01:04:23.579
lie-detector test I was nailing this

01:04:23.579 --> 01:04:24.810
they probably I think he did

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:26.790
probably meet with these guys anyway

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:29.820
that's something that the Mafia is very

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:31.710
good at just destroying the lives of

01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:34.230
like random people you know telling

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:36.060
you're killing your dad killing your

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.090
[ __ ] brother killing your son

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:40.410
crushing your dreams cuz you know it's

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:43.230
like it's uh I guess you have to respect

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:45.620
it in some ways to complete sociopathic

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.260

this is like there's like a footnote of

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:57.000
the story like Henry Hill like using

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.730
witness protection but he also like gave

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.830
this like interviewed a Sports

oh yeah like journalists just like put a

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.990

government was given like 1500 a month

01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:16.110

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:11.700
what the worth of where was I where was

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:16.469
I yeah Rick Kuhn got ten years for

01:08:16.469 --> 01:08:18.450
twenty eight months the other two guys

01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:21.060
Sweeney and Cobb didn't get any prison

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:21.750
time

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:24.089
Henry Hill didn't get anything oh and

01:08:24.089 --> 01:08:25.560
they that this is actually what they got

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.480
Jimmy Burke Ford you never got twenty

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.380
years out worthless tree X's you know

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:33.540
for orchestrating this this scheme and

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.100
then also Henry Hill fingered him for

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:35.609
murder

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:41.229

government way more information than he

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:03.100
