electic acid you docent it all today

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.100
no no sick when's the last time you dose

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.350
I've been off of it really yeah why I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.570
don't know what does happen Oh have you

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.370
been doing that vegan I think that's

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.020
what it is you've been going full vegan

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.750
yeah I was actually uh for the month of

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.149
January told I'm purely pant totally

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.370
vegan yeah it sounded hard actually it's

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.620
pretty easy but yeah preparation for my

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.059
new diet I tried to tell someone about

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.520
this last night and I watched them

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.690
repress the information that I gave them

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.670
well my new diet basically is

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.589
plant-based but if I feel I deserve me

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.990
then I'll eat me after this 30 days is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.090
up if I do something that I deem like

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.150
monumental enough to deserve meat I'll

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.060
secure like depending on like how good

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.830
of a thing I do like maybe a couple

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.200
chicken wings if it's a little thing

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.549
maybe if I say I like wrote another book

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.170
and finish the first draft I would go

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.610
get like four pounds of ground beef and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.210
that would be like the to kill the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.829
insulating hunter-gatherer you put my

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.990
freezer or something right yeah before I

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.340
could salt through four pounds in like

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.759
two weeks

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.840
I could eat four pounds of ground beef

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.900
before went bad four pounds even once

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.430
full keto is the easiest diet possible

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.159
just eat meat yeah I heard that about

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.079
you I've heard butchers oh yeah we

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.070
forgot to intro Johnny mckeavy yes

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.829
patreon one we got the legend on Nick he

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.530
is

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.590
the God now I don't I [ __ ] hate of

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.290
every game just hanging out like I would

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.300
quote normies dude I was just in normal

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.070
evil hanging out like telling this lady

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.660
about it I was like she's asking on my

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.990
diet

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.980
well might stimulate another

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.510
hunter-gatherer so I'll give myself meat

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.450
as a reward I watched her go and like

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.010
just not acknowledge it and this goes

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.270
yeah the the keto diet is Kiyo's hot all

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.590
right now it's very put yeah you can eat

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.140
some wings and blue cheese blue cheese

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.580
is perfect except no beer no beer I

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.900
haven't been drinking beer for a while

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.480
no beer no pizza no bread that's where

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.850
that's where it gets hard supposed to

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.459
drain yourself of carbohydrates to the

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.959
point where your body starts running off

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.610
an alternate fuel source which is your

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.120
fat yes this is Rogen's cast this is

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.730
yeah carbs and sugar this is what you're

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.220
eliminating I guess that makes sense

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.260
though you start burning fat as fuel you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.799
know so that's more fat as [ __ ] great

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.660
skin they do the other they're not that

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.030

polar bears dude they're jazz band rap

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.630

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.010
way to get in the right politics stretch

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.830
yeah yeah dude I actually saw in real

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.450
life the other day I parked and it was

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.920
like a Sunday this lady came out of

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.200
church she was probably like 40 or 50

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.630
she was leaning into a car like doing

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.250
something in the passenger side and the

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.810
wind was kicking I felt like rocking my

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.640
car and I was just like no way to dress

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.500
and I was like thirty yards away I'm

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.880
like no way the dress [ __ ] stands a

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.200
chance against this way and I'm sitting

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.940

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.830

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.840

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.110

cartoon that he jerks off it wasn't it

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.070
was an Indian [ __ ] comic book that I

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.600
don't know how I stumbled across it like

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.279
this [ __ ] aunt her like let her nephew

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:10.910
suck it's funny too because like they

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.470
only let out a certain amount of free

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.610
ones before you have to pay and it's

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.640
like I've seen all the Free Cities then

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.320
found a site that ran the paid ones they

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.839
took it down but yeah if you masturbate

00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:22.279
you if you have sex you have to say like

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:23.660
were you thinking about porn during sex

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.430
and all this stuff oh dude this sounds

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.750
like fun doing half of school or

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.220
something oh it's not you you don't

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.080
understand I I disagree because it's

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.120
like if my parents when I was younger

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.500
because dude they forbid porn in your

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.690
house I mean what they weren't giving it

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.339
out but like if you got call with it

00:11:37.339 --> 00:11:38.839
what happened they'd be pissed you get

00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:41.150
busted ever uh I remember I to tape and

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.830
then one day it was not there stay

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.200
didn't like confront you know what

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.630
because I think the idea of being like

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.420
talking to your son about yeah jerking

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.589
off there might I think my mom just

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:53.450
throw it out was I gonna fight dude my

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.700
socks were in her dryer froze yeah seven

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.560
she knew what was going on yes sure but

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.710
my parent my mom was like this is filth

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.000
she would find it like this is

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.620
discussing which I you know I I was like

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.360

playing a weird [ __ ] mind game with

00:12:22.339 --> 00:12:24.710
folks I mean I agree with him though see

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.570
if my parents were like dude don't watch

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.280
porn I think in a relationship you

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.589
should save all of your sex energy for

00:12:30.589 --> 00:12:32.839
your significant other wow that's sweet

00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:34.490

later come for your girls before like

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:46.100
you need to have to come to a certain

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.570
level to deal with a certain level of

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.490
[ __ ] that's absolutely true like if

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.810
I get all to come out of me and my

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:51.740

00:13:04.449 --> 00:13:07.119
I'm instantly shut the [ __ ] up yeah if

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.350
she's doing something right now that

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.660
bothers me and I'm like I can tell him

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.009
[ __ ] annoyed and stressed

00:13:12.009 --> 00:13:13.869
I'll go jerk off and then just be like

00:13:13.869 --> 00:13:15.670
there's been times where I've jerked off

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.939
and then like 30 minutes later I've

00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:24.009
remembered her [ __ ] we have a girl with

00:13:24.009 --> 00:13:26.800
a girl there's literally that happened

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.209
like two weeks ago I jerked off because

00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:30.790
I was mad at finished and then honestly

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.110
a half hour later I was on the couch

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:38.079
like playing xbox I was like I think

00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:40.779
state is to be so jacked up on comment

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:41.800
when your girl comes out you're like

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:49.629
what is if she she won't listen this

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:52.029
this is patreon dude this page yeah but

00:13:52.029 --> 00:13:55.899
what's funny is it was a fight I came

00:13:55.899 --> 00:13:58.089
and then immediately changed my mind I

00:13:58.089 --> 00:13:59.110
was just like yeah you do whatever you

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.990
want it's fine yeah I don't care you can

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.579

good yeah I love you just let me know

00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:13.360
and that's the thing if you had jerked

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.980
off twice that day and she tried to put

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.300
the move on you and you're just like I

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.009
don't really feel like it you never

00:14:18.009 --> 00:14:20.139

00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:54.249
proved her wrong it was like no no buts

00:14:54.249 --> 00:14:56.499
about it yeah I was right I supported

00:14:56.499 --> 00:14:59.499
the argument I won she goes I mean I

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:01.749
guess and my brother starts with having

00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:03.549

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:11.119
yeah she'll be like I guess yes yeah

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:13.669
you're wrong dude [ __ ] wrong

00:15:13.669 --> 00:15:15.619
Tommy has hit me with this twice now

00:15:15.619 --> 00:15:17.749
I've gotten girlfriend arguments with

00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:21.349
Tommy the first one is about

00:15:21.349 --> 00:15:23.659
he's like the Eagles need the Cowboys to

00:15:23.659 --> 00:15:26.479
lose to make the playoffs now you got

00:15:26.479 --> 00:15:27.979
this wrong you got this wrong

00:15:27.979 --> 00:15:30.919
the Cowboys can win the NFC East which

00:15:30.919 --> 00:15:32.989
they will and the Eagles can make the

00:15:32.989 --> 00:15:35.299
wild card mmm it's much more likely that

00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:37.369
the Vikings lose or I forget who else

00:15:37.369 --> 00:15:39.529
was in there then the Cowboys losing two

00:15:39.529 --> 00:15:41.739
games and the Eagles winning - yeah

00:15:41.739 --> 00:15:44.899
half our argument half our [ __ ]

00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:47.479
argument where he has no [ __ ] idea

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:49.639
what he's talking about and then finally

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:52.039
finally which was really nice the

00:15:52.039 --> 00:15:53.869
Cowboys won the NFC East and the Eagles

00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:55.189
made the playoffs they both made the

00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:56.839
playoffs so we argued for a half hour

00:15:56.839 --> 00:15:58.759
that only one of them could make it so

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:00.139
you know like hey look right here I was

00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:01.849
I was actually like you remember that

00:16:01.849 --> 00:16:06.079
argument we had remember that I was

00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:08.059
right the whole time was he saying

00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:09.469
they're both want to win and both go no

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.389
he was saying that the Eagles in order

00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:12.769
to make the playoffs needed the Cowboys

00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:14.839
lose oh yeah because in his mind for

00:16:14.839 --> 00:16:16.099
some reason he felt the only way the

00:16:16.099 --> 00:16:18.999
Eagles made it was if they won the NFC

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:24.639
yeah of course everybody know but then

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.810
anyway back to the what me and Tommy

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.870
fought about at the end of the Bohemian

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.010
Rhapsody they play the Live Aid concert

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.180
they're like one was last concerts and

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.130
at the end he started playing this song

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.810
like it sounded off-key cuz it was live

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.640
yeah and Tommy was like you see that

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.620
that's off-key because uh because they

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.990
couldn't get the rights to it what and I

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.760
was like dude it's a [ __ ] biopic

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.990
about Queen they definitely have the

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.300
rights to Queens music playing Queens

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.620
music this whole time what do you think

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.150
they fight another one bites the fly

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.980
would they do that we argued for twenty

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.510
minutes and then I was like you know

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.860
what I bet that is I bet the reason it

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.300
sounds weird cuz it's the actual live

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.200
audio from the concert this doesn't

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.340
you're not listening to me you're not

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.300
listening to me then he tries to roll

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.830
wind it and play the he's like see how

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.240
it's off there it's off there and I'm

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.950
like yeah cuz it's live it's live

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.690

that was actually the live audio

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.020

00:23:37.929 --> 00:23:39.309
like back and when it was at my

brother's house and it was literally a

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.400
helicopter crash and I was like driving

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.559
as a tail spun it turned like a green

00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:47.470
like drawling man and then a guy on a

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.570
string was like

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.620
really it was a normal movie other than

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.940
that we did a stunt you would just like

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.280
see the [ __ ] that's looking wild it's

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.570
pretty tight so what's the [ __ ] movie

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.309

it is one of the dumbest

00:24:08.419 --> 00:24:11.240
worst [ __ ] it's a true story about a

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.490
lady a writer who was like a failed

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:17.110
writer who started plagiarizing like old

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:20.210
letters from famous people she started

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.620
making them and selling the local

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.870

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.320
speech and it's just like I've been too

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.640
much of a coward to write my own stuff

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.850
I'm proud of this end of the movie it

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:35.450
was the worst [ __ ] it was this what was

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.640
the thing like I wrote this old ass

00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:41.120
a bookstore and sell it to them for like

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.940
a hundred bucks oh yeah she was

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.530
counterfeiting old letters that's the

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:46.940

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.840
someone's you're disenfranchised somehow

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.110
yeah and in [ __ ] Queen they made sure

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.820

a female writer you're [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:59.270
that's the truth what's that based on

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.000
Emily Dickinson is she she's [ __ ]

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.820

wrong definitely [ __ ] well the

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.480
funniest part is her when she tried to

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.220
like typically the adult realm she tried

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.050
so hard to write like a grown-up wizard

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:34.760
book and everyone's like JK just [ __ ]

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.090
just chill sit on the millions of it

and receive their award and the woman

00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:30.049
that [ __ ] received the award was a

00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:32.960
white lady and she spoke for all these

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.940
Asian spoke for the nipsey she spoke for

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.499
them and she read a thing about white

00:28:36.499 --> 00:28:38.570
men she was like when I started in this

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.659
industry a white man said other races

00:28:41.659 --> 00:28:43.309
wouldn't were like people wouldn't want

00:28:43.309 --> 00:28:45.049
to see diversity on screen it's like

00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:52.039
first of all would you say that you you

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:54.320
just [ __ ] you can just say that like

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.600
there's no oh yeah like it doesn't have

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.369
to be true you can just say like like

00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:00.200
there's so many anecdotes now where

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.999
people like when I first started people

00:29:01.999 --> 00:29:03.379
told me I couldn't meet because that was

00:29:03.379 --> 00:29:04.639
a woman it's like no they didn't yeah

00:29:04.639 --> 00:29:06.350
nobody said that yeah thought it in your

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.809
[ __ ] Honda Civic for 13 years and

00:29:08.809 --> 00:29:10.369
then you got somewhere and you're like

00:29:10.369 --> 00:29:11.600
oh I'm tired of people tell me that's

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.950
like no dude that was in your head yeah

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:16.129
the whole time anyway so John women's

00:29:16.129 --> 00:29:17.929
women definitely have not been put down

00:29:17.929 --> 00:29:20.090
and entertainment I agree with you they

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.009
have it they have they have not John

00:29:22.009 --> 00:29:30.230
McKeever review the worst and like just

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:34.909
some guy being like no one's own hot

00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:38.179
chicks like oh my god well that's none

00:29:38.179 --> 00:29:39.440
of these writers are hot check again

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.240
there's everything people have women are

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.529
[ __ ] well people have definitely

00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:44.960
told women that but it's never like hey

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.369
girl this specific girl I'm talking

00:29:46.369 --> 00:29:48.259
about is a sideline reporter who like

00:29:48.259 --> 00:29:50.389
them became like a camera girl and she's

00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:52.789
so [ __ ] high their Instagram it was

00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:54.679
like when I first started a guy told me

00:29:54.679 --> 00:29:56.149
I couldn't do this cuz the camera was

00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:58.100
too heavy for a girl but I did it

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.749
tonight and I kicked ass meanwhile the

00:29:59.749 --> 00:30:01.279
guy was probably like are you cool doing

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:02.720

so when you handle 40 pounds well also

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.509
technology is advanced in that time

00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:09.799
where the cameras are much lighter and

00:30:09.799 --> 00:30:11.629
easier to hold yeah he probably handed

00:30:11.629 --> 00:30:13.580
her like a shoulder strap [ __ ] thing

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.950

[ __ ] dicks real quick can I do one

00:31:13.519 --> 00:31:16.399
joke that specifically was like where

00:31:16.399 --> 00:31:17.840
he's like hey yeah Black Panther was

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.049
that about he did Joker he's like Black

00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:22.940
Panther was that about how black people

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.529
were like oppressed and then like it was

00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:26.720
he like made a joke that wasn't funny

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.919
but then he said like something really

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:33.200
like he was like yeah he was like is

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.549
this an action movie or did you guys

00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:36.529
make a movie that symbolized the proper

00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:38.090
plight of African Americans when that

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.590
came over on slave ships and then we're

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.360
systematically oppressed for hundreds of

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.590
years in America like he did one of

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:43.549
those things where it just went real

00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:45.230
fast he listed it and it was just like

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:46.850
practice he waited for people to clock

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:49.279
and then people clap they do this

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:51.799
monologue where the garbage know nothing

00:31:51.799 --> 00:31:53.210
funny about this and then it finally

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:55.880
ends with this what certain [ __ ] sand

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.059
your house is like and I just want to

00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:00.649
say this from the bottom of my heart

00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:02.240
after joking the whole time kind of

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.700
crying then she starts crying she starts

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.590
like pretending to be emotional and is

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.289
like they said we would never see this

00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:11.870
much diversity in this room and I see

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:15.200
you right now and it may not be this way

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.730
next year but this is it right then she

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.070
goes I see you and like pointing at a

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.240
table and they all started laughing they

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:23.929
thought she was kidding

00:32:23.929 --> 00:32:25.340
because she was just telling jokes she

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.899
was just on junkies and then she was

00:32:26.899 --> 00:32:28.730
like and this is the most powerful

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.830
moment and she like fake cried but it

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.899
was my secret oh there was also joking

00:32:32.899 --> 00:32:34.760
where Andy Andy Samberg made a joke

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.660

Asian table they needed to give him like

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.090
pepcid ac or whatever cuz I guess Asian

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.210
people have a reaction to alcohol and he

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.550

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.160
that it feels like we're living in a

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.650
culture now where people are trying to

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.870
be a new gift like the other day I Ana

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:25.910
she started filing her nails when the

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:27.740
sort when she was debating some dude but

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.960

00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:39.620
someone trying to have a conversation so

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.270

white girls pose yeah they're trying to

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.970
align themselves with minorities I've

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.800
seen I've wondered about that

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.960
specifically with like how that with

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.760
that snapchat how that interferes with

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.260
people's normal behavior so now people

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.670
start acting differently because of the

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.440
internet which is weird to think about

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.150
totally yeah it is it is all for white

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.810
chicks dude

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:16.270
so I'll watch it now I like the in that

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:20.080

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:25.330
white chicks and rich black kids yeah

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.570
that grew up in white neighborhoods

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:29.350
black kids that went to an all-white

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:32.110

01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:37.910
haters his [ __ ] no matter what he says

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:41.329
it's just like dude his and what's funny

01:04:41.329 --> 01:04:43.369
is like the liberal counter to that now

01:04:43.369 --> 01:04:47.299
is like that Alexandria Cortes check her

01:04:47.299 --> 01:04:49.609
being like cool on Twitter yeah which is

01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:53.000
gayer yeah like who versus Trump trying

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.069
to just be an [ __ ] yeah Trump's

01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:57.920
funnier he's 72-73

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.890
and he [ __ ] them up on Twitter and that

01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:05.329
blows my mind every time he was after he

01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:07.579
gave that speech about the wall his

01:05:07.579 --> 01:05:09.290
tweet was like that thank you that was

01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:12.710
so with like ten O's like he said that

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:14.960
was like so interesting he gave his

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.119
speech out of the Oval Office and used

01:05:17.119 --> 01:05:24.589
12oz and so there's a funny thing he

01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:26.119
does whenever he's giving a very serious

01:05:26.119 --> 01:05:28.069
speech he all breeze through his nose as

01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:30.020
hard as he hey

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:33.550
what we need to do we need a wall -

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:36.080
what's going on down at the border it's

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.480
a crisis and then he was like in the

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.970
speech he's like like this woman from

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:43.040
Maryland whose daughter was raped and

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.690
brutally murdered by illegal immigrants

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:46.640
or this man from Minnesota

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.270
whose wife was brutally raped or this

01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:52.820
other family from California all right

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:59.000
they were all raped by a very brutal not

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.460
good not a good one of the bad rapes

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.020
have a better work ethic when it comes

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:15.410
to raping well did you see wait so you

01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:16.970
don't want it so then Nancy Pelosi and

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:20.750
Chuck Schumer gave a response I saw yeah

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:23.390
it's [ __ ] [ __ ] honor do they say well

01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:24.680
I saw they're all in the office together

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.970
and that's when I was convinced we were

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:28.310
being run by like senile [ __ ] oh yeah

01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:31.030
that's right so they're like so Trump

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:32.150
daddy

01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:36.200
[ __ ] crosses up front especially at

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.530
one point he's like keep in mind that

01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:40.730
Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are both

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.350
about to give a speech after me they

01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:45.500
both voted for a boarder barrier five

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.260
years ago before me he said that he like

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.330
prefaced it was like it was like a

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:52.580
[ __ ] roast battle where he went first

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:53.840
and was like well the next groups a

01:06:53.840 --> 01:07:00.290
bunch of [ __ ] they didn't even like

01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:02.210
listen to his speech really they just

01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:03.770
came out it was like he's calling a

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:07.100
presidents choosing fear and like mr.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:12.620

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:30.020
black men and he's also pro-immigrant

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.120
and it's like what the [ __ ] did such a

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.370
weird stance they go by the ways against

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:36.080
murdering people without guns it's like

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.940
that's not a [ __ ] plant for yeah yeah

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.610
ma most people are most non psychos

don't want people getting killed

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.849
most police are

01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:45.799
yes yeah most of the guys that you hate

01:07:45.799 --> 01:07:48.140
in this debate or it's definitely like

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:49.640
I'm not a fan of that yeah and you're

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.559
like there's been a couple like I've

01:07:51.559 --> 01:07:52.940
seen a couple of videos where like a cop

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.950
shoots a guy now granted I'm not saying

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:56.900

yeah where he was at a traffic stop and

01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:13.099
basically yes he shot him and then you

01:08:13.099 --> 01:08:15.529
could see the cop I don't know this

01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:19.190
obviously the racism was this is the

01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:22.690
[ __ ] out of this the racism the the

01:08:22.690 --> 01:08:25.460
claim was that the racism was like

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:26.989
instilled in him and that's why he shot

01:08:26.989 --> 01:08:29.029
her which could be which could certainly

01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:31.489
be or maybe it was learned from being a

01:08:31.489 --> 01:08:33.049
police officer for a decade I don't know

01:08:33.049 --> 01:08:36.380

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:29.700
in the military academy

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:32.860
sorry that's true yeah a great soldier

01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:35.380
at work it's when I did demolition the

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:37.180
coolest thing that sucks too but like if

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:38.469
you drink a bunch of coffee you get

01:18:38.469 --> 01:18:40.150
jacked on caffeine and start breakfast

01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:42.100
you start breaking glass it does until

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:43.090
like

01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:44.349
just like knock a building over and

01:18:44.349 --> 01:18:45.880
they're like all right that was cool

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:46.690
watching that fall and they like

01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:47.949
separate the [ __ ] brick from the

01:18:47.949 --> 01:18:49.900
metal and you're like [ __ ] like

01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:51.580
demolition sounds sake all it was is

01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:53.920
like a machine would come and dump brick

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.469
stone or like stone and metal and wood

01:18:56.469 --> 01:18:58.300
and I'd have to like separate it and

01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.770
then I'd like you to scoop it away the

01:18:59.770 --> 01:19:01.150
other thing was scoop and I'd bend over

01:19:01.150 --> 01:19:05.739
and be like I was for months you stand

01:19:05.739 --> 01:19:09.810
out there then like Wally's I try to

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.449

you're like I couldn't do it and he

01:19:25.179 --> 01:19:27.250

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:30.580

01:19:31.869 --> 01:19:33.280
appears that's the thing I think that

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.540

01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:45.070
and I didn't know anything about guns

01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:46.599

01:19:46.599 --> 01:19:49.449
guns yeah yeah yeah I was in the labor

01:19:49.449 --> 01:19:51.070

walked through a picket line and was

01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:36.639
like taking stuff up yeah that's the

01:20:36.639 --> 01:20:37.570
whole political thing if you have a

01:20:37.570 --> 01:20:38.560
construction company you guys you're

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.670

sit there and talk to dad does that go

01:20:48.489 --> 01:20:50.170

laborer like you can have you can fully

01:20:52.599 --> 01:20:55.960
be like Jews run Hollywood [ __ ]

working for them after we made a sketch

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.910
and we had talked about we as soon as we

01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:20.950
started working for the show it was like

01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:23.320
we can't be deplorable we can't have

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:26.560
that in the name that was the whole stop

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.300
doing like stopping ultra right-wing

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:29.980
like if we're if we're

01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:32.080
middle-of-the-road this could be a

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:34.150
pretty big success yeah we told we told

01:23:34.150 --> 01:23:37.000
him we're like if you are anti political

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.970

01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:49.600
exciting like people aren't like he

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.220

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.480
you specifically I remember you arguing

with him because I had argued with him

01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:10.760
about it for so long and I was like I

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:11.660
can't [ __ ] do it anymore

01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:13.400
yeah yeah and Shane was specifically

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.950
like dude if you align yourself this was

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:17.000
the conversation because I was a Ryan

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.010
Fournier thing and he was like if you

01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:21.440
[ __ ] align yourself with the right you

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.330
are the right yeah if you align yourself

01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:23.870
with the left

01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:25.700
you're the left so don't [ __ ] align

01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:27.290
yourself with either one yeah and all

01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:28.790
these people in the [ __ ] country that

01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:30.920
are tired of all of it yeah well [ __ ]

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:33.560
come runnin sure they all want this [ __ ]

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:34.940
everybody wants it right now yeah and

01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:37.430
they have nowhere to get it and he had

01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:38.930
the chance and I do think if he would

01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:39.860
have made that see if he would have

01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:41.480
funded it and we would have got

01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:43.250
everybody that we knew we liked we would

01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:46.070
you to the firefighter we did the

01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:48.050
Gilbert Godfrey one and the white

01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:48.870
supremacy want

01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:50.910
which got progressively more liberal

01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:53.280
yeah yeah like the Nazi one was like

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.860

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:57.390

talking about that sketch that head

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.780

this going to be like we're gonna make

01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:06.660
fun of everybody yeah and they're like

01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:11.180
yeah yeah yeah it was like Mexicans

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.800
specifically I remember specifically I

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:16.170
wanted to make a sketch at the very end

01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:19.680
about the dude who makes my pillow I was

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:21.360
like a [ __ ] get to the wears like a

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.610
cross again infomercial where's like my

01:32:23.610 --> 01:32:25.710
pillow makes me sleep better but they

01:32:25.710 --> 01:32:27.060
don't ever mention he was a [ __ ] meth

01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:29.340
addict for like ten years so I wanted to

01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:31.050
make a fake commercial where it's like

01:32:31.050 --> 01:32:33.270
it's called a high pillow where it's

01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:34.980
like you got the perfect pillow because

01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:36.570
you were a meth head for so long you

01:32:36.570 --> 01:32:37.920
found the most comfortable way to sleep

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.810
I feel like you've been through so much

01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:40.980
[ __ ] that you found like the best

01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:43.110
comfortable and he was like we don't go

01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:46.680
after that base and he was like they

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:47.940
actually do a lot of advertisement on

01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:51.390
Fox News and I was like oh I was like so

01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:52.770
you don't want to go after conservatives

01:32:52.770 --> 01:32:59.190
and I was like all right yeah he don't

01:32:59.190 --> 01:33:00.930
want to hurt conservatives at all

01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:02.880
he actually said after the Nazi sketch

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:06.180
came out he was like basically we've

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.560
made a mistake because that went after

01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:10.680
our base people got our base the [ __ ]

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:12.300
are you talking about we don't have a

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:15.660
base like this is me and Shane's [ __ ]

01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:17.910
yeah this is me and Shane stuff that

01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:19.320
we're making that we think is funny like

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.480
we don't have a [ __ ] base and then

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:25.610
when you retweet [ __ ] Ryan Forney or

01:33:25.610 --> 01:33:29.370
some [ __ ] right-wing dildo it was

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:31.770
like dude that sucks and hoed the host I

01:33:31.770 --> 01:33:33.630
don't think I really don't think at the

01:33:33.630 --> 01:33:36.270
end of the day you don't I do but good I

01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:38.550
didn't know trust me i we think the same

01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:39.960
thing they think in the beginning he

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:43.170
really was like how do I make something

01:33:43.170 --> 01:33:45.630
different and then he got hooked he got

01:33:45.630 --> 01:33:48.420
he got attention from the right

01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:52.500
he was like his facebook friend request

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.270
from like fat white dudes or the oak

01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:56.960
leaves on their heads

01:34:00.769 --> 01:34:03.090
but yeah you got a [ __ ] watch this

01:34:03.090 --> 01:34:06.449
trailer it is dude do you and Annie came

01:34:06.449 --> 01:34:08.789
in for that meeting mm-hmm holy photos

01:34:08.789 --> 01:34:10.590
so Annie came into the office to like

01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:13.920
sit for them to run a pitch and those

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:17.570

01:34:21.449 --> 01:34:22.110
everything in the guy who's in

01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:26.280
everything what not a we don't know but

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.960
at one point they came back and was like

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.340
they did say the name deplorable was

01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:31.710
ridiculous yeah which sue me and Sheen

01:34:31.710 --> 01:34:33.360
both [ __ ] right all my first day I was

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.320
like you got changed that name that

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.239
thing's [ __ ] ridiculous

01:34:36.239 --> 01:34:38.639
it's fun and it's hacky so when Lucy

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:44.940
died and made that guy boss it was like

01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:47.340
a mob bosses [ __ ] son taking over

01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:48.630
and be like I'll just make a TV show

01:34:48.630 --> 01:34:51.059
yeah then you're gonna be the star of it

01:34:51.059 --> 01:34:53.070
have you ever done open mic stand-up

01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:54.539
comedy and you think you can talk to a

01:34:54.539 --> 01:34:56.420
[ __ ] live studio audience

01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:59.099
it was [ __ ] not so towards the end it

01:34:59.099 --> 01:35:02.130
was like it was clear that the in flight

01:35:02.130 --> 01:35:03.809
with the Caitlyn Jenner thing that's

01:35:03.809 --> 01:35:05.849
what we were like - like we're not

01:35:05.849 --> 01:35:08.729
sitting here [ __ ] bleeding hearts for

01:35:08.729 --> 01:35:10.170
transgender people

01:35:10.170 --> 01:35:11.369
we're just saying if you're gonna make a

01:35:11.369 --> 01:35:13.860
[ __ ] joke make it funny exactly and

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:15.449
you're [ __ ] making it up I think

01:35:15.449 --> 01:35:17.309
without him being or sorry you're making

01:35:17.309 --> 01:35:19.320
a joke about her being transgender yeah

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:20.639
how the [ __ ] is that funny it's like

01:35:20.639 --> 01:35:25.530
well I think it's funny yeah remember

01:35:25.530 --> 01:35:27.479
the Olympic athlete pretty much it was

01:35:27.479 --> 01:35:30.510
like so now it was like this man woman

01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:32.309
called like you know did the whole

01:35:32.309 --> 01:35:33.960
[ __ ] dead naming thing which first of

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.809
all like they're just doing that to

01:35:36.809 --> 01:35:37.769
[ __ ] be trolls

01:35:37.769 --> 01:35:39.869
you're saying Bruce Jenner to piss

01:35:39.869 --> 01:35:41.639
people off yeah yeah you're not saying

01:35:41.639 --> 01:35:43.499
it because you [ __ ] love a man unless

01:35:43.499 --> 01:35:45.300
you're a black dude over the age of 35

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:49.769
sure you can't use dead names Bruce imma

01:35:49.769 --> 01:35:52.050
call him Bruce can and it's like oh yeah

01:35:52.050 --> 01:35:54.449
dude whatever you want the show but yeah

01:35:54.449 --> 01:35:55.829
they made a thing that was like the

01:35:55.829 --> 01:35:59.719
video about Caitlyn Jenner was like

01:35:59.719 --> 01:36:02.249
whatever how old she is like 50 year old

01:36:02.249 --> 01:36:06.210
man woman Bruce Jenner married 20 well

01:36:06.210 --> 01:36:09.239
I'm your own man woman and hopefully

01:36:09.239 --> 01:36:10.769
they stick together cuz if these two

01:36:10.769 --> 01:36:13.320
can't make a work maybe love's not real

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:16.800
that was the video it was like so the

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.870
joke is you just said man woman which by

01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:21.510
the way is pretty funny I'm thinking

01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:23.760
it's so gay but they eventually took it

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:24.390
down

01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:25.800
and I was like once they took it down

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:29.430
they're like we had already like people

01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:30.990
would screenshot it it was like dude

01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:33.030
you're done like this is like yeah

01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:35.600
you're not this isn't sustainable like

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:38.220
it's the same [ __ ] that was going on on

01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:40.140
the [ __ ] left

01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:43.440
it's like empty [ __ ] [ __ ] jokes

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.750
[ __ ] humor of like and I'm a girl and

01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:47.310
I don't make as much pause for laughter

01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:49.440
and it's like Jesus Christ yeah well

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.350
maybe because I respect women it's like

01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:55.200
yeah Trump or the older but early go to

01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:01.410
and now Pete Lee yeah you gotta watch

01:37:01.410 --> 01:37:03.030

01:37:10.530 --> 01:37:12.840
think there are like a massive [ __ ]

01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:15.330
people out there dying for [ __ ] that's

01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:15.720
funny

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:18.360
mhm and nobody's giving it to them and

01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.400
then like the one shot potentially that

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.140
could have happened he got [ __ ]

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:23.880
hooked on the right and they were like

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:25.890
this is all right and he was like he

01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:28.080
must have been like yeah all right it

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.390
was it was like ow Jesus Christ you ever

01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:32.070
lose a friend in grade school to like a

01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:34.800
cool group of people can see it was kind

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.680
of like but it was a cool group it's

01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:43.920

drift to the [ __ ] dark side yeah yeah

01:38:13.170 --> 01:38:14.550
and then what's weird is like afterwards

01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:16.320
like after that firefighter video which

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.900
