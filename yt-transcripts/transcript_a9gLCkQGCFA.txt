i've been following you like throughout

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.320
the podcast that you've done since this

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.160
whole thing started and it's like carmen

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.840
san diego because i haven't like you

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.439
know i just go all at once and i'll

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.119
start going like okay that podcast must

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.880
have happened before that one must have

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.080
happened before that one because we

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.000
started with salt life and then we were

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.640
in arizona and now you're in tennessee

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.360
so so what has

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.720
where have you been

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.880
since this all started

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.960
yeah i don't know i i think it makes me

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.240
sound like a [ __ ] but uh i've never

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.479
literally never traveled more

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.840
uh

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.840
i was in florida when it started and

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.600
then i stayed down there for like a week

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.799
or two

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.799
and then i got a house in

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.439
south carolina in hilton head for like a

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.240
week and then uh virginia in the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.920
mountains like i got a lake house for

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.280
like two weeks

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.520
and then i uh drove to bisbee arizona

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.159
to hang out with stanhope for the last

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.799
like three weeks and now i'm driving

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.640
back yeah

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.840
are you are you doing this because it's

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.119
cheaper to travel right now or you just

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.320
try to avoid new york you're like

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.600
[ __ ] i might as well when it's you

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.000
know rent or uh or halfway it's a little

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.360
yeah it's a little bit of both uh my

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.640
i'm definitely not going back to new

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.440
york right now uh there's no point

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.400
um

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.720
and then i i would i would go home my

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.000
family lives in harrisburg which is

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.599
where i'm going right now but at first i

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.520
was kind of you know afraid of it

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.599
because my parents are old and uh my

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.599
sister's like going through like chemo

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.160
and [ __ ] so i didn't want to

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.040
risk killing my whole [ __ ] family

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.680
uh yeah yeah and airbnbs are cheap as

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.080
[ __ ] and you can travel and yeah

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.959
so you figured you'd that

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.640
yeah yeah

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.160
so your plan was just to go to multiple

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.640
states across the country

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.040
can you hear me jim

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.080

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.440
oh okay

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.040

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.200
just blatantly disrespecting you

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.120
yeah no there's no first there's no

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.319

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.680

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.040
we uh

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.640
got like

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.080
you know we rented a boat me and a

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.200
couple a couple of my friends from

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.640
philly came down

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.319
they had comics from philadelphia they

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.840
came down and uh

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.080
you know we just hot tub and drink

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.920
mostly drinking that's kind of all we've

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.760
done

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.120
it's perfect

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.560
so when are you coming back to new york

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.799
or you have no idea

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.879
uh right now i don't know i mean i guess

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.280
i guess it would be when

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.159
[ __ ] gets opened

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.760

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.080
if clubs are open i don't know

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.959
yeah i guess if you don't know if you

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.560
want more people and they're not getting

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.400

you're not hearing us at the same time i

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.920

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.120
time but

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.120

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.439

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.799

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.239

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.520
so angry at myself for not just staying

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.720
in the house and then the next day i

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.400

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.360
dick you're fine yeah yeah yeah

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.880
so the people that are stuck in new york

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.960
have they been mad at you

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.320
for not being there because i know at

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.080
first there was this sort of

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.120
town

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.280
pride or whatever but i feel like that

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.680
escaped as people all realized we should

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.280
not be here

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.800
yeah they got they got over that they

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.000
tried to they tried to make the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.919
marketing plan the same as they did with

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.919
the [ __ ] boston marathon and get

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.520
everybody to be like

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.759
we're new york strong baby it's like

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.240
that you guys are [ __ ] sick you're

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.560
not strong just relax

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.000
you don't always have to be tough you

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.840
have the flu right now

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.840
yeah yeah it's bad everybody's getting

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.610
it there

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.160
[Music]

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.919
oh [ __ ] i have it

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.840
do you have a favorite spot that you

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.000
visited that you've cause well first of

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.240
all so you said at first

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.000
that you didn't want to just go home and

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.759
kill your whole family

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.479
but then you said now you're on your way

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.560
to where your family is and it's way

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.600
worse now because you've been in

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600
multiple states and seen multiple people

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.759
so if you didn't have it before

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.280
you definitely have it now so if you

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.759
weren't going to kill them then

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:46.960
i think it's more likely that you're

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.199
going to kill them now yeah well i don't

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.360
give a like uh i really don't care

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.880
anymore my mom was being a real [ __ ]

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.240
about me going to stan hopes so

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.000
uh i'm definitely she was she was she

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.160
like she would call me and be like i

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.360
know you're doing drugs i'll be like mom

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.360
there's no [ __ ] drugs here i haven't

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.639
seen a drug

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.560
she what are you doing my mom

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.600
no i didn't i didn't do any drugs

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.759
my mom was like

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.240
she watched youtube videos about

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.160
stanhope because she didn't know who he

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.960
was

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.199
so like every night she she would watch

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.080
stan hope [ __ ] youtube interviews

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.919
where she was like this is who my son's

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.919
with he's doing that made her feel much

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:30.760
better

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.810
[Laughter]

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.720
or no is he actually doing what he's

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.759
supposed to be doing or does he not give

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:38.800
a [ __ ]

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.520
uh he's

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.440
he's doing it

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.880
yeah i don't know i think he's being

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.319
[ __ ] reasonable they're in bisbee

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.280
arizona so like people people were

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.120
coming over and stopping by the place

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.880
but kind of staying far away from us and

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.199
relatively practicing social distancing

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.039
yeah for sure

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:00.880
so it sounds like you have a mom who

public enemy number one for a week or

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.319

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.880
about them and goes well who are they

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.440
staying with i hope that they're safe

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.319

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.720
well my mom's also a white nationalist

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.080
and she was actually pretty proud of

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.960
that you didn't go far enough she said

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.960

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.479
was like i promise i'll do my best and

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:44.440
that's why i moved to new york

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.160
[Laughter]

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.080
she probably was she must have already

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.840
been she had a day

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.240

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.840
weekend to throw it in all her friends

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.520
faces and then it immediately went to

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.879
like sympathy like a bug died it just

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:18.560
instantly was like

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.319

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:22.800
you know i don't think he's that racist

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.319
what was the process like for you like

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:26.400
with the agents like where the agents on

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.840
the phone go look dude this is probably

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.919
not a big deal but look they're calling

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:32.320
asking a question like does the agent at

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.399
first try to keep you feeling positive

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.440
because that's the worst when you're

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.560
getting calls from the agents and

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.039
they're like i think this will blow over

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.440
how were they handling no they were

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.959
they were hitting the [ __ ] panic

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:44.480
button hard

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.399
immediately they were like well i was i

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.640
like man life life's pretty good

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.399
and uh

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:57.839
i still felt weird about it the whole

00:08:57.839 --> 00:08:59.680

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:12.160
crazy but uh

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.480

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.160
night it got announced i was gonna go i

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.080

i got a text yeah an agent my agent

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.920

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.560
like did you say uh

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.480

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:32.480
there's

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.839
there's another one

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:36.240

yeah remember i would never say it there

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.519
is some context in which i would have

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:50.080
said it but the context really really

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.120
matters

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.120
yeah no but then i'll be honest there

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.519

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.440
like i was just kind of saying it on

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.000

writer from the new york times about a

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.720
write-up and then i'd get a call like an

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.360
hour later like now we thought about it

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.200

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.040
other writer telling your story we want

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.440
you to go on cnn and do this interview

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.360
with anderson cooper and i was like i'm

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.000
not doing i'm not i'm not gonna sit down

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.079
and discuss comedy

00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:20.000
like i'm not i'm not trying to because

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.519
it would it would come off as me just

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:23.519
imitating a patrice o'neill clip from

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:24.800
fox news

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.800
right it'd be it'd be an open micro

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.639
going on and being like i know funny

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:32.399
you don't know funny anderson and i

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:34.240
would i don't have his strength that

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.480
would break

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.720
trying to get a cameraman to laugh

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.440
yeah i would probably have cried

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.800
but he wasn't in trouble when he did

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.079
that patrice was defending opiate

00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:45.279
anthony so you would have had a reason

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:46.880
because you were defending yourself so

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.320
it would have been fair for you to go on

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.920
and and speak you had every right to

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.839
you're funny and you deserve to be on

00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:54.320
snl and it was just shitty

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.920
oh thanks um yeah but snl also you know

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.600
it would have been cool to be [ __ ]

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.839
rich and famous

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:05.199
yeah it would have been awesome but also

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:06.880
you would have had to do these weird uh

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.120
snl at home shows right now

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.800
yeah it was a pretty i watched [ __ ]

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.800
uh ah see look dude this is what happens

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.839
i sit down i start talking [ __ ] on

00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:16.639
people he's got me in trouble i was

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:18.960
literally about to start naming people

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.240
[Laughter]

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.160
did you do you start to like do you

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.120
start to

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.120
do you start to rethink everything when

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.320
you're in these meetings and they're

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.839
like you said this and you're and

00:14:27.839 --> 00:14:29.920
multiple times now you said i did not

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.920
say that and then your agent or lauren

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.600
michaels or whoever it is is like you

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.040
definitely did and here's the tape of it

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.440
and you're like oh [ __ ] do you start to

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.000
realize like oh i need to start thinking

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.600
about what i'm saying into microphones

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.160
because clearly like we all we record so

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.639
much content that none of us remember

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:47.920
anything that we say we just remember

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.800
what our intention was and if we didn't

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.360
mean to we were just trying to be funny

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.480
we don't ever remember the words right

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.320
yeah i mean i guess i guess if you if

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.160
you do start to worry about it i guess

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.040
you got to kind of stop but uh yeah

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.720
because otherwise i mean what's the

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.079
i mean nobody wants to hear me do a

00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:08.399
podcast where i'm like

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:12.079
you know a [ __ ] about it but um

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:13.360
i don't know the

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.160
like

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.600
yeah you're right about that though like

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.839
i i i would remember my intentions so if

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:19.199
somebody brought up something like

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:20.800
[ __ ] up that i said i'd be like no i

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.959
don't [ __ ]

00:15:22.959 --> 00:15:24.800
i don't feel that way racist why would i

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.560
be racist against asians what am i a

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.000
[ __ ] [ __ ]

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.199
right

00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:31.920
andrew reached out to you

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.759

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:47.759

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.880
andrew yang be like hey guys uh i think

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.399
we got to just take things in certain

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:00.320
contexts and kind of defend you a little

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.560
bit without going full tilt he was like

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.399
kind of on your side or at least not on

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:05.839
the side of the mob

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:08.240
and it was one of the few times that the

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.160
mob turned on him too and they were like

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.399

know calling him like a [ __ ]

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.720
yeah they were like he's a white

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.079
apologist he's just trying to get the

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:21.759
white vote dude look at him bending the

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:23.360
knee to these white supremacists it's

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.639
like dude i made a podcast you [ __ ]

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.399

did he tell you or did you still have no

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:46.480
well he he never found the

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.839
i was like i don't think that's out

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:50.160
there like i i don't think that clips

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.160
out there of me calling someone

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.199
yeah

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:54.880
there it was literally it was somebody

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.680
that worked on the show

00:16:57.839 --> 00:17:00.320
so i was like wait what

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.240
and uh

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.480
which dude i was here's here's what it

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.799
is and this is this is just you know i'm

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:08.880
not like making excuses i'm just telling

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.160
you like

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.400
i was an open micro in philly

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.720
that was pretty good at stand-up and

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.319
wasn't getting any

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.880
opportunities i'd come home every day in

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.120
the uh i had a mattress on the floor in

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.959
a basement i'd be getting drunk after

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.039
open mics and sitting down and being

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:28.160
like this type of comedy is why i i'm

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.919
getting nothing because all this woke

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:32.010
[ __ ] all this [ __ ] like dude

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.480
[Music]

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.559
dude i'm watching like guys go on stage

00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:37.840
and be like

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.000
catcalling's wrong right it's like dude

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.400
what are we doing and i thought that was

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.240
why i wasn't getting opportunities not

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.600
because i just

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.000
lived in a basement in philadelphia as

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.559
soon as i moved to

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:52.480
york and got every opportunity i was

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.039
like oh maybe i was being kind of a

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:57.120
jealous [ __ ] that whole time and i was

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.720
pretty embarrassed about it

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.120
i

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.200
i was very embarrassed about it

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.480
that is the thing that happens when

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.080
you're not successful

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.760
you start blaming the people that are

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.280
successful like they're doing something

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.200
wrong and it's stopping you and then

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.559
when you start to get some success

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.799
you're like oh wait a minute i would i'm

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:16.080
just better now or i'm just in a

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.760
different scenario now or i'm in a

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.919
different location now or whatever it is

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:22.480
and you realize it wasn't it wasn't

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.000
their fault they're just doing yeah i

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.480
mean there's a

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.480
there's truly there's a ceiling in

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.799
philadelphia you can be a good middle

00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:32.320
and then you got to get out you got to

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.679
go to la or new york and that's how it

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:34.960
works these days like as soon as i moved

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.440
to new york

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.000
within [ __ ] months i had an agent

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.480
management got jfl comedy central

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.640
saturday live in one year it's like oh

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.400
[ __ ] i should have maybe the industry

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.400
doesn't hate straight white guys like i

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.160
thought

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.679
yeah no there's only a certain element

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:53.840
of it that that does but yeah i mean you

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.520
could you can still succeed and get

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.600
where you're going regardless of the

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.720
climate i know what you're saying though

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.720
like sometimes it feels like [ __ ]

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.160
because of all this other stuff this

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.760
isn't happening you know it's just a

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.520
natural instinct

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.000
yeah and you

00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:10.240
see i mean you still see the [ __ ]

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.000
like shows that are being put out that

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.600
are like yo

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.039
this you guys are more focused on

00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:17.200
diversity than funny and uh that's

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.000
that's clear on a lot of it

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.520
yeah and it's irritating as a comic

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.799
because you're kind of taught like we

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:24.720
just call things out when we see them we

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.320
say what we think of things and a lot of

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.919
times it's not pleasant this is where

00:19:27.919 --> 00:19:29.360
you almost admire actors and their

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.799
ability to go like no i've never i don't

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:32.559
know like you almost admire their

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:34.000
ability to keep their mouth shut yeah

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.360
yeah

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.440
when you when the uh when the onslaught

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.200
was coming in

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.880
were you

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.320
was there any panic

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.480
of like oh my god this is never gonna

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.120
stop this is everywhere i'm never gonna

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.480
get any kind of success because this is

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.000
gonna start back again if it does oh

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.520
there's so much more tape of me doing

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.960
this i like

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.880
did those thoughts start to kind of take

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.400
over or were you

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.679
pretty

00:19:57.679 --> 00:20:00.480
self-assured of look you know

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.559
at the worst case scenario i'll just go

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:04.400
back to stand up

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.120
um no i was i was

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.280
very i was i was more confident then

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.840
probably you know while the middle

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.760
like while you're while you're in the

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.000
newspaper and on cnn every day it's easy

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.200
to be like maybe i am famous you know i

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.200
felt like a [ __ ] it's like a school

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.799
shooter that's all of a sudden on every

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:24.960
[ __ ] channel like i did it i did it

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.200
i'm famous but uh

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.039
no i i was always confident that i'd be

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:31.760
able to do stand-up and uh

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.520
i had people behind me that were you

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.799
know

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:35.520
like

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.720
that was the only thing i wanted to do

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.880
like i didn't move out here to

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.200
i didn't move and make this my career so

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.960
that i could

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.440
you know dress up like a [ __ ] turkey

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.400
and dance on nbc like i did it because i

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.039
wanted to do stand-up so

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:53.600
uh no i was always confident in it yeah

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.200
and since i started reaching out to

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.640
somebody or talk

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.840
you gotta turn your mind somebody who

2016.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.760
but it's funny comedians we're all very

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.440
sensitive to what other comics i think

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.799
it's like with another comedian it

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:14.559
doesn't matter what level they're on

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.080
with the comedian shit's on me i'm

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.400
always like [ __ ] it like it it bothers

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.919
me in a way that it wouldn't it wasn't a

00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:20.960
comic

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.080
no he's he's he's right to be

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.840
upset yeah for sure i would i would have

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.440
been upset but like

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.520
you know i guess i guess i kind of got

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.200
used to getting [ __ ] on the last couple

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.240
[ __ ]

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.200
months

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.799
you're immune to it almost right it gets

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:35.840
like a little numbing when you're like

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.520
yeah this is just the way yeah i'm

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.960
starting to

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.600
yeah yeah it never i'm working on it i'm

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.039
working on it i got to stop i got to

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:44.480
delete [ __ ] i got to stop reading

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.080
[ __ ] comments and [ __ ] but uh

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.520
i don't know i think most of them are

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.720
funny like if somebody if dude if i was

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.440
not not chris but judd apatow and read

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.760
an article that was like hey some guy

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.240
called you gayer than isis

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.279
i'd be like

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:03.039
he's getting fired he's getting fired

00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:06.159
from snl for that

00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:10.480
it's weird it's funny

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.919
if someone said they don't like you it's

00:24:11.919 --> 00:24:13.200
one thing but it's when they start to

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.960
figure out like this is why he did it

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.159
and then you're like no that's not why i

00:24:16.159 --> 00:24:18.720
did it like yeah for sure

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.000
that's the part i'm sure that that

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.840
drives you crazy

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.159
yeah for sure and then and then like

00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:26.720
it's it's from both sides so from from

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.520
like the [ __ ] woke side of it i am

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.559

00:25:56.799 --> 00:25:59.039
i appreciate the solidarity

00:25:59.039 --> 00:25:59.919
you don't want to piss off your

00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:01.520
supporters by correcting them you're

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.880
like yeah yeah i guess so but you don't

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.760
want to piss somebody off who's

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.799
supporting you because it's like well

00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:06.480
[ __ ] that person that's my back

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.840
like when trump was talking about the

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.400
kkk and yeah i don't know i don't know i

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.440
don't know who they support i don't know

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.799
anything about them like he wouldn't say

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:14.880
he wouldn't go to bat for them but he

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.159
wouldn't say anything bad about them

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:18.159
because he knew that they supported him

00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:21.600
yeah yeah i've a hundred percent

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.799
i understand what he's doing

00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:26.240
yeah i guess that you can't pick who

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.159
pick and choose who supports you or who

00:26:28.159 --> 00:26:29.440
backs you and it's gonna be some people

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.880
you admire and some people you like and

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.880
some people that are just like [ __ ] and

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.240
you know you don't want to start weeding

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.039
through

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:36.559
who's supporting you it's like anyone

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:38.559

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.170

00:27:44.799 --> 00:27:46.960
to be able to publicly judge you

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.120
yeah and i didn't want to scold somebody

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.120
for a joke like even if it's wrong

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.200
yeah come on

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.039
after a show yeah

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:56.960
taking pictures it's like

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.279
hey get this piece of [ __ ] out of here

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:01.279
yeah that's not appropriate

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:03.679
yeah man it's great to me and i'm glad

00:28:03.679 --> 00:28:05.919
you're a fan but you know if i could

00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:07.760
teach you a little something too i mean

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.440
my comedy is about laughing but also

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.039
about learning yeah i want to make sure

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:12.720
you guys learn about

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.720
culture

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.520
you're really not going to teach anybody

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.799
you're not going to change anybody with

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:20.399
your [ __ ] like i never want to change

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:21.679
i figure you give your opinion and

00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:23.039
whatever they do with it they do with it

00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:24.559
but comedians that stand there i think

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:25.679
they're really going to change the

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:27.279
culture and the way people it's like

00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:29.360
you're not no one no one you're not

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.799
gonna change anybody's opinion on

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:33.440
anything yeah and how i mean imagine how

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.320
[ __ ] dumb you'd have to be to

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.480
watch a comedy show and then leave there

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.399
like hmm

00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:42.720
i guess i am gonna make some changes

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.720
yeah

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.679
yeah you are a bit easily led if that's

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:50.960
if you're looking at the comedians to

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.559
get your real opinions from you're

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:54.320
probably an easily led like well

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.360
community to a responsibility shut up

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.440
yeah yeah it's funny too because i'm

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.120
sure look i've done enough podcasts

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.399
where i'm sure you can find some clips

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:03.760
of me out there like

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.760
yeah i'm in the trenches perfecting my

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.600
craft and uh

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.520
yeah this is it's about the art like i'm

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.200
sure i'm sure at one point i've said

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.960
something [ __ ] pretty corny about

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.120
this but yeah yeah i

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.640
i agree with uh the current mood

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.080
do you uh

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.000
go ahead jim i know i can't tell if i'm

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.360
on a delay still so i'm trying to be

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.360
careful so i apologize if i'm still

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.679
stuttering uh because i sometimes shane

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:28.720
your mouth is moving and then i'm

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.320
hearing you 10 seconds later so i

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.320
definitely it's definitely my connection

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.559
um how do you reset like yeah now that

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:36.640
that's done i'm looking forward to this

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.799
like okay that part's moved past that

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:40.640
part and you because again you're really

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.240
funny or a good stand up and you know

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.640
everybody respects you comedically so

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.000
like what do you

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.360
how do you reset and go alright this is

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.600
the next goal

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.360
um

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.880
i don't know i mean the goal never

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.480
really changed like i just want to have

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.200
a

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.559
good special

00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:57.600
someday

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.480

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.720

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.320
and then

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.399
then i got spiked back down to just

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:10.720
being like hey hopefully comedy dynamics

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.440

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.200
i honestly dude i had one week where i

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.799
was like

00:30:18.799 --> 00:30:21.679

00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:26.880
now i'm gonna hook up like all this [ __ ]

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.279
and then and then some some [ __ ]

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:33.279
[ __ ] was like he said a bad word and

00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:35.360
yeah

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.200
and you can't but you can't then turn

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.640
around like when everybody's calling you

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.720
racist you can't turn around and be like

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.320

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.679
dreams

00:30:43.679 --> 00:30:45.360
yeah yeah yeah like that's not a good

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.159
defense for racism yeah be like wait

00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:50.000
i was about to be in the movies guys

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.120
don't call me racist no i uh

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.600
yeah i i mean i [ __ ] i knew it it

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.360
made sense the whole thing made perfect

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.440
sense everybody

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.039
like when people were defending me i was

00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:02.880
like i don't i mean i appreciate it for

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.880
sure but it's like i get it i understand

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.200
why i'm getting fired like you can't

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.919
you're not allowed to say bad words

00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:12.240
yeah it's just what it is so so that's

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:12.880
it

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.720
understanding nbc's motivated of course

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.399
everybody understood why they like after

00:31:16.399 --> 00:31:17.679
a while they have to because it's just

00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:18.960
too much [ __ ] they're taking it's

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.480
different than agreeing with it though

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.360
you know what i mean and when you i

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.880

your career like you've never said [ __ ]

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:31.039
that if all of a sudden what's allowable

that i should go into this trying to

00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:26.880

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:56.960
funny

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.480
yeah

so what's been here there's only one i'm

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.039

what's been in your travels during

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.039

do you have a favorite spot that you've

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.679
been in or a favorite place that's you

00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:15.519
think is handling it

00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:17.760
better than other places

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.240

i think i'm just going crazy i haven't i

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.119
i'm

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:42.079
i can't write i'm pretty bad at that and

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:44.639
uh yeah i was like oh nice definitely on

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.159
this drive this long drive i'll

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:48.320
definitely get some [ __ ] uh some

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.000
material out of this

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.159
and uh no i've just been driving listen

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:54.240
to the same [ __ ] 10 rap songs i took

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.320
him i took adderall yesterday and had a

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.160
panic attack i was like i was driving

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.079
and i was like all my friends think i'm

00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:02.720
gay and they hate me

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.280
that was for eight hours i was like i

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.320
actually suck at comedy

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.880
so uh no it's it's same old the only way

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.599
i got material was doing stand-up and uh

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:15.440
without doing it i'm just sitting around

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.960
uh i got a good premise about uh

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.079
how they know volleyball shorts are bad

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:24.160
to put on little kids because i went to

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.079
my niece's volleyball game and all the

00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:27.839
kids were wearing hot

00:35:27.839 --> 00:35:30.400
little [ __ ] tight shorts which is

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.359
weird

00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:34.000
yeah necessary for volleyball and uh

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.599
because i know they know it's wrong

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:37.359
because they don't do it uh for the

00:35:37.359 --> 00:35:38.880
special olympics they give those girls

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.000
[ __ ]

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.760
big shorts

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.200
and i'm trying to get to the bottom of

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.960
that conspiracy that's what i've been

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.160
working on

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.720
that's good stuff isn't it

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.079
would you like i could write i'll have

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:51.520
some time to whenever i think i have

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.839
time to write i can clear my head i get

00:35:53.839 --> 00:35:55.920
[ __ ] nothing done

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.520
it's when i'm not exposed to be writing

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.880
like when my flight is late and i'm

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.400
literally going through security that

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.480
i'll come up with it's never

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.680
by the way even talking to you i just

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.680
pick a hack premise my [ __ ] plane is

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.920
late and i'm through airports

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.040
but you know what i'm talking about it

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.880
never i can never sit down and clear my

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.720
head and just write like i never get it

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.119
i get nothing done no my friend uh my

00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:17.920
friend francis uh who is a writer he got

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.839
fired from barstow barstow yeah i like

00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:22.079
him yeah yeah yeah yeah i'd say getting

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.839
getting getting fired from barstool is

00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:26.400
probably even a bigger accomplishment

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.920
than getting fired from snl because like

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.440
how do you get fired from barcelona

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.440
especially because francis francis is

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.359
like genuinely like a sweet dude like

00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:34.320
he's like

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.079
like if i say something [ __ ] dub in

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:40.119
front of him he'll be like oh wow

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.640
and uh no he got his stories so you

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.760
gotta have him on because it's so

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.839
[ __ ] funny he uh

00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:49.839
his he wrote an article about this girl

00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:51.760
who got kidnapped being like a [ __ ]

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.640
[ __ ]

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.620
yeah she

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.200
[Laughter]

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.119
well he thought they found her his

00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:58.320
timing sucked because he thought that

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.320
she was found and okay

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.839
and then you write it and it comes out

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:03.440
and it's like he really [ __ ] up this

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.359
just he was just talking about it he was

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:06.560
talking to me about it and he was like i

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.960
was on a amtrak and this article came

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.119
out that was like they found her charred

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:14.030
remains and i was like oh no

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.560
[Laughter]

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.560
so did he try to take the article down

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.000
did he's like hey maybe they could take

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.680
it down or would he just i don't know it

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.200
was too late i think he was i think it

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.680
was almost like uh i could i don't know

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.599
sorry it made me laugh think about

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:29.040
francis

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.560
uh

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.960
seeing charred remains um but

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.800
no the what brought me to that was he

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.040
was the one he was like he's a writer

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.480
he's a really really good writer and he

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.079
was like oh you're traveling around

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:41.359
during this quarantine like you're going

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:43.520
to have amazing stories like maybe you

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.280
can write a book about this

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.599
i was like dude i couldn't i can't write

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:49.599
a single pair f

00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:52.079
like i could not write a paragraph about

00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:54.320
this trip

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.680
yeah it's when you think you're supposed

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.839
to be coming up with these amazing ideas

00:37:57.839 --> 00:37:59.760
that [ __ ] creatively i'm just a

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.960
[ __ ] dud like absolutely nothing will

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.720
come and it's always when you're just

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.599
not

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:07.359
expecting something really good you just

00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:09.280
kind of on stage you probably just do it

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.480
on stage just [ __ ] come up with an

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.640
idea and try it and you know but a guy

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.400
like colin who's so brilliant we'll

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.160
literally have a finished book by the

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.640
time this is over like that's a great

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.800
comic who uses his time wisely

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.400
it is hilarious to me that somebody

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.119
coming off of the greatest professional

00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:26.480
trauma

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.480
in their entire life a trauma

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.920
professionally that most people will

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.960
never even uh experience

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.119
you decide then to while the world is

00:38:35.119 --> 00:38:37.520
shut down go on a cross-country road

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.240
trip by yourself and it's just

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.320
nothing no

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.200
there's nothing no it's me driving and

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.800
checking instagram for 4 000 miles

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.640
that's all it is dude

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.960
i know it sounded romantic on paper

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.240
i was like

00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.240
i smell i'm fat

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.160
and then we go we go like oh man you

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.200
know you're really clear in your head

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.400
and you're like whoa

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.079
i've been thinking

00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:07.440
kids wear those volleyball shorts

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.200
they're really short huh

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.560
i guess

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.920
that's what we got

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.440
that's pretty good though that's gonna

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.480
be a good one

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.920
were you in florida doing a gig when

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.040
this whole thing happened and like your

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.359
whole schedule just shuts the bed right

00:39:19.359 --> 00:39:21.760
i was in uh key west

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.200
and

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.880
and then i was supposed to go to south

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.400
by southwest which that would have been

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.240
interesting yeah because south by

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.599
southwest they like

00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:31.200
tried to kind of pretend i wasn't on the

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.640
flyer

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.000
oh really

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.839
yeah no actually south by never mind

00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:37.440
that was moon tower south by southwest

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.119
did like

00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:41.359
they were pretty open uh

00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:42.880
the guy who runs it was like openly

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.640
supportive of me which i was i was

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.240
pretty excited about but

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.320
the acts that were going to south by

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.960
southwest were very actively not too

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.480
excited about me

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.520
really

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.200
so that would have been uh that was

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.079
gonna be an interesting uh

00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:00.000
[ __ ] week i mean i think andrew yang

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.200
was gonna be there i think that was

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.720
gonna be an interesting

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.760
that could have been a cool week and

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.119
then as soon as that got canceled i was

00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:06.960
like i'll just stay in florida

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.040
and uh take a vacation because i haven't

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.880
had a vacation in a while

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.560
right now i've just stayed on a [ __ ]

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.800
vacation it's even weird to see you

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.880
place the place it's funny you talking

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.920
about the restaurant because it's even

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.240
weird when you signed on to zoom just

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.079
seeing you in a hotel room

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:24.240
like to me seeing a person in a hotel

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.160
room right now i'm like that's weird i

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.760
didn't know there were hotel rooms right

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.880
now

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.480
yeah i mean the first one i went to was

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.800
sold out by the restaurant that was full

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.680
wow

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.000
tennessee doesn't give a [ __ ] tennessee

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.359
it's just like

00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:39.760
i think we're getting it yeah

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.720
yeah

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.280
yeah yeah i think it's uh you guys i'm

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.560
sure have you guys been in new york the

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.599
whole time

00:40:45.599 --> 00:40:47.119
in and out yeah but i've been mostly

00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:49.280
there yeah so that's got to be very

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.880
traumatic and then

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.720
well that's why there's so much like

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.440
crazy division because in new york

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.800
we're all like

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.040
everybody is getting corona you gotta

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.040
stay home and in tennessee they're like

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.560
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.280
nobody's getting corona let's all go out

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.160
yeah and uh and now both sides want to

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.480
prove that they're right so yeah

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.079
it's just it's

00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:14.640
it's it's exactly how i figured our

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.960
country would handle a crisis at this

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.680
point where it's hardly actually trump

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.839

00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:43.119
down to being in and out it's a little

00:41:43.119 --> 00:41:44.400
frustrating doing these from the road

[ __ ] cool yeah i like chris i think

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.880
like most of us he's just sensitive and

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.240
he gets his feelings hurt like by

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.160
another if that was if you were not oh

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.160
man if somebody called me sensitive i

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.079
got my feelings hurt

00:42:08.079 --> 00:42:10.720
i would want to fight you but dude no as

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.160
a comedian i am sensitive to other

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.480
comics i don't mean hypersensitive like

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.640

[ __ ] it bothers to be fair sure yeah for

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.680
me one time kevin pollock publicly said

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.440
that i wasn't good on the radio and i

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.319

these people yeah

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.200

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.720
[ __ ] roll off their back like with me it

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.720

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.079
[ __ ] that like i remember you know some

00:42:50.079 --> 00:42:51.359
guys can let it go off their back and

00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:53.280
not ever care about it again every

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.880
insult it's 911 dude i'm i will 100

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.599
never forget what you did to me

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:00.880
but do you think do you think people

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.160
really let it roll off their backs i

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.200
feel like the people who say they're

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.800
letting it roll off their backs are like

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.440
the very successful people who are not

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.640
letting it roll off their backs they're

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.920
just smart enough to not say anything

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.359
publicly and then behind the scenes

00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:13.520
they're [ __ ] people

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.160
yeah i think everybody my age like i've

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.599
i've done it like five different times

00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:18.800
where i'm like all right it's time to

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.800
stop reading [ __ ] internet comments

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.079
about myself

00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:24.560
and then that day i'll be googling

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.400
my [ __ ] name so

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.319
uh i think our generate like younger

00:43:28.319 --> 00:43:29.920
people especially are never gonna stop

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.319
reading comments and uh

00:43:32.319 --> 00:43:35.200
once you start reading like i i did get

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.760
pretty good at letting like media

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.640
insults roll off my back like i you know

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.319
i'd see my name in like

00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:43.680
the washington post be like all right

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.359
whatever and just go about my day

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.880
but like when it's yeah when it's like

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.359
just some weird like opium anthony fan

00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:52.960
that puts out a [ __ ] tweet that's

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:57.520
like he's a [ __ ] i'll be like hey

00:43:58.079 --> 00:43:59.520
this guy used his real name was calling

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.200
you he's he's questioning your courage

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.400
for not handling it a certain way but

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.839
meanwhile he's too afraid to say it as

00:44:03.839 --> 00:44:06.640
himself so it's like take those to heart

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.880
so much i know and then but then they

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.720
have a point where it's like me i talk

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.720
[ __ ] on so many people and so many

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.720
things it's like yeah they're they're

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.720
[ __ ] allowed to call me

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.880
whatever they want so it's like

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.280
uh they you know there's valid points on

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.800
the uh internet

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.200
internet troll side as well so they can

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.640
say whatever they want yeah but i just

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.240
respect that hey look you know when you

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.480
when you say things as yourself

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.240
like almost like comedians that bash you

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.760
they have to have the embarrassment of

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.520
facing you like if there was a comedian

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.720
that said he should be fired then they

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.480
have the embarrassment of having to look

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.520
at you

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.040
and know that

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.400
it's just an uncomfortable thing it's

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.720
funny it's funny to think that they what

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.400
did they think i was going home

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.079
after the snl thing like they weren't

00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:51.680
going to see me for the next 20 years

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.839
unless i die i'll die i'll die was there

00:44:53.839 --> 00:44:55.839
anything you knew beforehand or was it

00:44:55.839 --> 00:44:57.680
people who you just didn't know

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.720
um most it was always people i didn't i

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.839
didn't know

00:45:02.839 --> 00:45:06.400
uh you know what's right i listened

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.040
ah i don't want to [ __ ] on her um

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.240
that's like the fourth time that's

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.319
happened in this one conversation well

00:45:12.319 --> 00:45:14.319
i'm [ __ ] making it i'm genuinely

00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:17.280
making an effort to stop going on shows

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.160
and be like yeah that person does suck

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.200
yeah

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.000
because i really need there's no point

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.079
no uh i mean it's funny it's kind of

00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:28.640
funny but uh

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.319
it's just

00:45:30.319 --> 00:45:33.520
someone you knew [ __ ] on you

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.440
uh i don't think so i mean

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.960
the i'd say the most annoying things

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.720
were just like

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.400
comics because i'm still new i'm still

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.119
new in philly or in new york yeah and i

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:44.839
was new at the time and

00:45:44.839 --> 00:45:47.359
uh just having like the older comics

00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:49.359
kind of like critique what i was doing

00:45:49.359 --> 00:45:51.119
and how i was doing it

00:45:51.119 --> 00:45:53.119
and and just

00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:55.359
that that that [ __ ] hurt me not hurt

00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:56.880
but that [ __ ] annoyed me when i'd

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.040
like walk into a club and see see people

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.040
criticizing like oh he shouldn't have

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.079
said this or you shouldn't have done

00:46:02.079 --> 00:46:03.280
that it's like dude

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.640
don't even worry about it you'll

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.960
literally never have to deal with this

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.079
i love that you're pretending you don't

00:46:08.079 --> 00:46:09.839
have feelings i love that you're because

00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:11.440
