00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.119
mood then then i was anxious about

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.640
getting to that show because we were

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.560
running a little late yeah yeah

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.400
yeah healing that was

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.520
yeah i drew that it was my woman brain

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.040
we all have a part you're an anima dude

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.200
your anima [ __ ] acted up i was like

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.200
we're running late this is his fault

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.799

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.720
late i don't need to do this like i

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.439
could i could feel the [ __ ]

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.000
the woman madness towards you oh you got

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.439
it i was like i need to [ __ ] you got

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.720
to start medicine we got to turn this

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.479
off you gotta start meditating

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.920
yeah well maybe it's because my yoga

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.600
practice has taken a hit really i

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.640
haven't been doing it you've been off

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.399
the cbd's too you know yeah i did have

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.479
to stop those they were too powerful

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.000
what i'm telling you the mix is the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.159
perfect one because the big bottle some

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.080
[ __ ] dude that i won't even

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.440
name trying to spread rumors that i'm

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.440
cutting it with oregano oil

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.040
[ __ ] them up dude yeah

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.319
boy hit me up he's like yo i'm defending

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.360
your honor dude but some people are

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.360
saying that the big one so there's the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.760
750 which is high concentrated which

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.640
kind of

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.160
gives you a buzz and there's a 900

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.239
milligram which is like not as high

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.920
potency but i th it's pleasant it's nice

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.680
does the trick but if you're used to the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.760
750 and you do the 900 you're just kind

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.080
of like the 900 is not as potent per

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.599
milliliter no because there's still more

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.680
milligrams in the bottle i see so i mix

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.840
the two so it's not as like spacey and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.840
like stone feeling and you're still

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.280
buzzing around but you still get a nice

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.360
[ __ ] relaxer so i mix the bottles so

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.720
i might start mixing them make my own

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.879
[ __ ] i felt like i was driving poorly

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.599
or cbd oil like i felt like i was real

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.040
[ __ ] relaxed like i'd be on the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.480
turnpike just like

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.319
going [ __ ] 80 around turns it's just

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.280
like

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.720
because you killed all your dreams you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.160
killed all your anxieties dude it's

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.080
crazy it's i mean it's like it's

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.319
technically is a gaba reuptake inhibitor

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.560
so like it whatever the [ __ ] gabba is i

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.239
don't know but it but it's some [ __ ]

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.680
like serotonin it's one of those

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.040
[ __ ] that floats around your

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.280
brain and floats through the center

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.920
serotonin

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.959
serotonin dopamine dopamine is highly

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.120
responsible for schizophrenic behavior

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.040
really schizophrenics are like

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.720
their bloods are afraid their brains are

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.319
flooded in dopamine that's what happened

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.080
to the youtube lady

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.120
dude

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.599

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.120

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.519
a tough it's one of the tough ones dude

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.319
but my thing is like

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.000
i don't think this [ __ ] mass shooting

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.920
stuff is about i mean yeah it's about

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.319

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.239
what do people in iraq use and [ __ ] or

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.159

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.400
she was paranoid she was like super

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.400
paranoid she was nuts here's all i'm

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.240
saying dude

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.160
why don't we just take a lady like that

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.759
have a weird algorithm on youtube where

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.759
like they just give you like

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.600
millions of fake views and like a little

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.199
universal basic income where you can

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.880
kind of live in some weird environment

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.319
and no one ever you're like yeah you're

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.759
a youtube star man you make [ __ ] a

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.280
thousand bucks a month

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.720
you live at your parents house and do

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.319
what you got to do hopefully that's what

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.919
youtube shouldn't do someday we can get

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.560
there youtube [ __ ] instead of

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.120
like diminishing her views she was

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.199
looking at stats she hadn't posted on

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.720
that website of hers i'm not gonna lie

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.240
dude look at this just a little bit of

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.000
her and me when libsyn [ __ ] with our

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.680
stats i was like where is this [ __ ]

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.919
place exactly

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.960
where is it going on here

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.880
yeah that's uh

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.479
you can see her video again you can see

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:14.560
in her face she's just crazy dude and

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.800
her dad did you hear this her dad so

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.960
they found her sleeping in a parking lot

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.919
her dad and her dad

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.120
i guess talked to the police and was

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.319
like yeah she [ __ ] hates youtube

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:27.199
like what are you talking about he's

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.120
like just i'm telling you she's coming

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.720
for youtube that's what she's doing

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.800
right now and they were like all right

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.000
i mean you can't arrest someone who was

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.080
she what kind of gun was she rocking did

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.479
she go in there like a pistol lara craft

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.160
lara croft tomb raider with two pistols

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.919
on her leggings short shorts damn she

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:43.440
went in there and lara croft looked hot

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.639
as [ __ ] dude

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.080
that was probably one hot [ __ ] lady

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.720
because i don't even get pistols missing

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.560
i i gotta like see what's going on with

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.599
her i don't even know if she's

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:52.960
schizophrenic dude but i haven't seen

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.960
her videos i'll show you a video if we

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.960
pause at any point i'll show you a video

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.800
she's doing squats and then she's like

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.960
these two black spiders crawl across the

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.199
screen and then she keeps doing squats

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:05.120
it's awesome that's some wildfire she

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.879
was making some cool [ __ ] it's too bad

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:08.639
she died she was

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.000
it sucks

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.680
but again thank god that wasn't a white

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.560
man

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.919
last thing you want coming through those

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:15.759
doors is a [ __ ] white dude or a black

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:17.759
dude in the trunk of a car if a black

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:19.759
dude air dropped the trunk of a car into

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:21.039
youtube he would have no one would have

00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:22.240
known where it was coming from dude he

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.360
would have been picking people off for

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.639
days

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:26.400
i dude that would be

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.160
we just got to convince mass shooters to

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.440
use paintball guns because i think he'll

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.599
be equally as effective and cathartic to

00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:34.000
roll into youtube and expect pop pop pop

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
you might as well if you did that you

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.519
wouldn't be a villain you wouldn't have

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:38.640
to shoot yourself well i guess you could

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.760
shoot yourself with a paintball gun

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.039
afterwards just for a dramatic effect

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.680
they don't hurt like a [ __ ]

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.519
but you do with paintball guns you roll

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:47.200
in you're a national [ __ ] hero dude

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.640
everyone's like oh my god this guy lit

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.160
them up with paintball guns true you

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.760
live you pay a little price she would

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.120
have shot up youtube with a paintball

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.800
gun the point would have been made dude

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.920
and people would be like yo she's the

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.839
[ __ ] and casualties would have been the

00:08:57.839 --> 00:08:59.200
exact same it would have been like four

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.519
wounded yeah dude it'd been like four

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:03.680
with hard welts yeah which i think is

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.760
what happened

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.920
she probably winged a couple of people

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.519
you probably winged a couple of nerds

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:11.279
dude i mean there's not much body mass

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.480
to aim at that was tough it was like

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.839
shooting a bunch of popsicle sticks

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:14.720
they're probably all wearing like

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.560
sweaters and scarves and [ __ ] that was

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.279
probably tough to hit

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.839
it's like walking into a field of

00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:24.399
scarecrows yeah you know which one

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:26.000
yeah that's uh

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.800
yeah r.i.p lady r b whatever you will

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.640
not be forgotten weird name was you made

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.040
a good run dude dude she went and got

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.519
five stars bro

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:36.560
helicopter

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.760
yeah that's dude that sucks that

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.680
man i mean i'm gonna say though if your

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.560

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.880
you know what i mean what to go shoot a

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.200
couple people on youtube first it's like

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.640

dude

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.320
there's the worst ways

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.279
i mean

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:02.160
you get to get on the news

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.000

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.519

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.480
[ __ ] up face like while i was trying

encampment kind of like wild wild

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.959
country i was in this weird encampment

00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:06.320
it's like a recurring dream like the

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.360
place i'm in with like a bunch of

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.040
computers and chairs and like it's just

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.240
bizarre

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.640
and i kept explaining things whenever i

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.160
would say black people a lady would be

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.680
like you can't say black people you have

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.560
to say

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.000
brown people and i was like what the

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.959
[ __ ] does it what's the difference

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:20.240
between that and i was kept arguing

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.079
people i'm like [ __ ] fine whatever i

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:23.440
went into the bathroom and there's these

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.760
four people with [ __ ] meth needles

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.959
they're doing they're shooting meth they

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:28.560
had needles and i was peeing in the

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.240
bathroom with you and i was like i gotta

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.839
get the [ __ ] out of here yeah we were

00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:32.800
peeing in the bathroom and there's

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.000
people these are like yeah they're

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.760
flicking meth needles and then i walked

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.920
out of the bathroom and i'm like where's

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.440
shane and i was like oh no shane's in

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.120
the bathroom dude is he doing meth and i

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.399
woke up and i was like

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:43.760
i was definitely doing it you were you

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.600

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.720
oh god oh god oh my god

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.000
yeah that's so we might have connected

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.519
on the astral realm dude

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:53.839

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:06.079
in your dreams now in your mind it was

00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:07.839
so bizarre and it would be like i'm in

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:09.040
the middle of like talking in a normal

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.880
conversation someone like 30 yards away

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.240
be like you can't say black people and

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.360

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.720
they're like brown people and i was like

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.600
no

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.399
that's

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:22.480

so much [ __ ] driving that was another

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.919
thing that contributed to me being salty

00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:57.039
yesterday

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:59.120
that was yeah that was a week straight

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.440
of just driving at least driving at

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.039
listened to four straight episodes of

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:10.400
dan carlin

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.240
those episodes are like four hours long

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.520
holy [ __ ] [ __ ] all world war one

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.480

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.880
oh my god and again

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.559
you put me onto that and i can't i'd

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:22.000
listen to it even i'd listen to it for

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.400
[ __ ] 16 hours and every time you said

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.760
it again i was like god damn it dude how

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.280
many can you count

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.799
constantly just get your head around

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:31.440
it's like imagine again

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.600
these are human beings

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.880
like you and i

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.080
torture

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.600
if you're allowed to talk in hardcore

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.640
history you're [ __ ] up dude

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.480
it's it's called a

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.640
blueprint for armageddon i think

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.400
it's so [ __ ] that's like part you'd

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.720
listen to parts one through four yeah

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.240
i still have another part of it i'm a

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.760
ww2 head so am i wwe one is kind of

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.600
[ __ ] you get it now you when you're

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.080
in the store can you imagine i never got

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.080
into it what did our ancestors go

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:00.960
through

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.760
again true that it's [ __ ] nuts dude i

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.000
i just like i said that [ __ ] is

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.080
it's so weird to me to think about how

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.520
that [ __ ] started because when you look

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.880
at it it's usually

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.200
usually economic [ __ ] dude usually a

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.960
couple billionaires are like nah dude

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.960
[ __ ] you and they're like [ __ ] me huh

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.640
all right dude well how about this and

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.240
they like whisper into some [ __ ] nut

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.520
and they're like dude

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.320
yeah guys shoots the archduke next thing

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.000
you know dude there's like millions of

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.760
people dead and it's like yeah all right

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.799
we win

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:31.840
it's [ __ ] up it is but this is uh this

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.600
was at a time when

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.760
there weren't a lot of huge armies

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.799
leading up to this there was never

00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:38.400
really a war like this

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.000
that was the first american civil war

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.120
was like

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.760
kind of pre like industrial

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.440
war where thousands and thousands and

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.600
thousands died so like everybody kind of

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.039
looked at the american civil war and was

00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:50.159
like

00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:51.360
that's kind of what it's going to be

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.120
like there were small wars everywhere

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.360
like japanese versus russia

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.440
the russo japanese war where like you

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.120
got to kind of see what's coming but

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.640
nobody knew world war one was gonna be

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.120
like i mean it was it opens with like

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.600
cavalry charges into machine guns here

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.039
where millions of people are dying

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:08.480
that's [ __ ] up oh they were still in

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.080
old school mode of like

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.760
standing in lines like the french when

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.280
they you know when the americans went

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.559
out and got necessarily standing in line

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.240
but yeah pretty much yeah like old

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.400
school tactics against like

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.240
they like we would just build a fort and

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.600
then the other other side would have

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.799
artillery

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:24.240
and just destroy it think about how much

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.000
is advanced now now it's like you go

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.080
gain intelligence through like cyber

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.760
hacking and then you have people like

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.400
throwing secret coups over there dude

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.080
yeah you couldn't i don't they have to

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.880
take the whole economic like military

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.640
industrial complex and just take all

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.440
that money and invent like a really sick

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.600
game that all the countries can play and

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.360
whoever wins the game you can put the

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.200
same effort and war into it whoever wins

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.039
gets like the more of the like the money

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:51.440
spoils bitcoins yeah or like you know

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.799
you just get more of the money and more

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:54.320
the cool stuff rather than going in it's

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.760
like so everyone's playing this [ __ ]

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.200
game it's nonstop

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.320
that's a good that'd be a good thing to

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.240
do that's a nice thing you know yeah i

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.559
mean and then i spent i spent this

00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:04.400
morning watching um

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.320
shell shocked videos of these dudes from

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.360
world war one that like with ptsd and

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.679

00:24:11.679 --> 00:24:13.039
horrible dude like their bodies stopped

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:14.000

from home [ __ ] up orders and [ __ ]

00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:17.200
going off around them yeah but just from

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.880
yeah from being in like artillery

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.919
barrage barrages and [ __ ] like that yeah

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:23.840
it's like it [ __ ] you up so bad that

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.039
your body is destroyed just mentally so

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:28.880
they're like our fireworks basically

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.400
like for a dog

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.880
yeah literally we're like

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.520
yeah except for like four years old and

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.960
you get to watch everybody explode

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.080
around you

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.400

the artwork that came out of it was sick

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.159
though a lot of these soldiers like

00:24:46.159 --> 00:24:48.400
became artists oh yeah they came out

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.799
with gas masks and trenches and it's

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:52.159
pretty sick that's true especially

00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:53.600

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:11.360
first blow

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.840

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.679
it's like the d'angelo video where

00:25:17.679 --> 00:25:18.880
remember everyone thought d'angelo was

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.159
getting a [ __ ] and like no one could

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:21.919
see it i think carlin's getting stroked

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:23.360
and he's like and then

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.520
oh that's a good theory he is getting

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.880
ahead everything i think remember you

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.480
always uh who's the guy he always

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.440
references he's like if you even exist

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.480
yeah yeah yeah that guy's probably

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.679
giving him like a foot job under the

00:25:33.679 --> 00:25:36.480
table that makes perfect sense oh

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.880
the franco brushing more

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.320
yeah

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.760
um

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.279
speaking of the d'angelo thing you were

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:45.600
talking to me about uh

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.960
r b

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.200
songs oh my god i forget what it was

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.960
it's funny as [ __ ] i hit this theory the

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.919
other day i i've had a very turbulent

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.919
racial time with my girlfriend recently

00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:57.840
to wear like well not turbulent but just

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.039
she's been putting me in really

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:01.120
uncomfortable waters to where like

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.640
i'm hanging out with her i'm not even

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.679
hanging out i'm on the couch i'm

00:26:03.679 --> 00:26:05.360
chilling she calls me the other day and

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.559
i was telling her like i had plans to

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:08.559

00:26:08.559 --> 00:26:10.480
girlfriend white dude blackjack same

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.240

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.360
you know we'll chill out or whatever

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.039
we're gonna hang out and uh

00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:16.720
because my girlfriend's all about church

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.159
dude it's like she really wants to go

00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:19.440
start going to a church so i'm like they

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.279
go to a non-denominational church i'm

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:22.559
like we'll go with them whatever it's

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:24.640
like well like what kind of black chick

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.120
is this what kind of black chick is she

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.720
and i literally you guys went on a

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.320
double date to church no he didn't go

yet he didn't durkin invited me and i

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:33.919
was like that'd be nice for her

00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:36.720
so that's thoughtful of you exactly dude

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.240

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.799

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.920
all going to be this and that it's like

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.920
it doesn't work yeah just on the

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.880
personality level if you and everyone

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.560

that just happen to have dominant

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.520
personalities so it's like they're going

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.760

allowed to make anything like a

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.440
political allegiance so like when people

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.280
will start dominating the commune you

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.640

using their land properly which fair

00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.520
enough for them because they live in a

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.720
quiet town now they're like wait you're

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.319

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:09.839
never-ending tip and they didn't like

those commune people they didn't like

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.400

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.760

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.880

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.520
tale of [ __ ] two weird cities dude

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.079

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.119
think you said you didn't get to this

00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:28.960

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.599
hilarious the indian the retreat what

00:43:31.599 --> 00:43:33.520

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.200

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.599
rajneesh the city of rajneesh yeah they

00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:39.040
need and then again you're a white dude

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.880
in overalls and also your city becomes

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.640
welcome to mirage niche dude you're just

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.240

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.160
masturbating your shotgun just like oh

god it's time oh my god they uh

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.440
they needed votes

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.760
to win this county seat well they were

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.160
going to dissolve the [ __ ] whole town

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.520
try to do that they try to dissolve

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.010
that's why they got renamed raj

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:00.880
[Laughter]

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.720
but then later there's another election

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.319
where they they're trying to elect like

00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:05.599
county officials they're trying to buy

00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:07.200
the entire county

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.839
and then uh so in order to get votes

00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:11.680
they're like we need to just get

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.680
at least a thousand people more in our

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.839
city so they just go out and get as many

00:44:15.839 --> 00:44:17.839
homeless people as they can

00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:19.760
from all over the country just homeless

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.520

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.520
and vote with us

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.359
and then they were just like

00:44:25.359 --> 00:44:27.119
that's when the wheels come off because

00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:28.800
those boys came in

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.640
they're like this is paradise

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.800

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.839
15 of the homeless people were like okay

00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:42.000
i'm getting back on my feet but dude a

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.520
lot of those guys are like completely

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.880
thousand of them and they're like we can

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.440
fix them we can treat them like humans

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.960
and then they're like dude they just

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.119

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.560
rape culture dude if you're living on

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:15.760
the streets that's the biggest thing if

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.119
you're living in abandoned houses and

00:45:17.119 --> 00:45:19.599
[ __ ] what's to stop some [ __ ] meth

00:45:19.599 --> 00:45:21.440
out junkie to just like spot you out in

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.800
your sleeping bag and [ __ ] tear

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:23.760
through that

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.560
dude

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.880
they get [ __ ] raped hard

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.160
and most people you don't think about

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.440
that man when you see some guy with a

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.960
sign it's like you might just sit on

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.280
those vents but steve come on [ __ ]

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.200
steam that butt out they just took one

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.400
in the [ __ ] keystone

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.480
i love the idea of this commune just

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.920
being like we can take these people in

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.920
and then just instantly it's just like

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.240
the whole thing just dissolves and then

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.760
they start like exporting homeless

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.720
people they're like all right you got to

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.480
get out of here well it dude it's a tale

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.319
as old as time i think and i i think i'm

00:45:52.319 --> 00:45:54.880
not totally sure david bowie did

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.040
something like this to where he was like

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.640
people just need a place to go to and

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.160
freely like create and express

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.359
themselves and it just turned into a

00:46:01.359 --> 00:46:02.480
bunch of people mooching off them and

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.920
acting like [ __ ] or it was like yeah

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.680
you know what [ __ ] this

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.440
[ __ ] and it's like you break every

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.480
that's what happens you do so many

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.079
hallucinogenics and acid and [ __ ] that

00:46:10.079 --> 00:46:11.520
you break everything down to like the

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.960
beginning of time in your own head to

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.200
where you're like no we can start new

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.720
and then you just go on this new path

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.560
and all of the old lessons of everything

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.400
is like oh yeah all this shit's here for

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.839
a reason and it all makes sense and you

00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:22.960
get depressed and you become like a

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.560
shitty hippie and you're like you become

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.000

everyone's bored it's like you gotta i

01:00:54.079 --> 01:00:55.119
think people i mean this is very

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.799
rogan-esque but it's like it's not

01:00:56.799 --> 01:00:57.839
everyone should do it but if you're

01:00:57.839 --> 01:00:59.280
really like what am i even doing it's

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.480

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.559
good

01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:04.720
my normal sense of reality i'm taking it

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.480
for granted you gotta disturb it every

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.760
now and again

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.960
that makes sense

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.079
but i i've discovered that the only

01:01:12.079 --> 01:01:14.240
thing this is really corny also but the

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.839
only thing that like keeps me away from

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:18.079

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.560
