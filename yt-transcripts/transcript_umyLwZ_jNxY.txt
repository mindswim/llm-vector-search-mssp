get big value packs of swedish fish they

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.760

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.319
and and yellow

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.319
that's not a real swedish fish though

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.840
it's the swedish fish company makes an

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.280
assorted pack

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.200

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.120
besides red or assorted

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.360
that's it so they don't have yellow

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.640
running in its own pack

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.760

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.160
here's what's going to go on

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.919
let's go tell me what you want me to do

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:57.039
yeah because i've been going through

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:58.080
this on the road a lot lately

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.440
i've played with uh rob mayu okay

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.319
and shane both of them i'm i'm going on

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.360
the idea that neither of them are

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.319
listing this right now

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.080
well shane's coming in i know so i'm

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.160
gonna get it up before he gets here

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.840
both of them here's the thing i don't

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.840
want people to come over and then stop

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.479
playing

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:16.879
because i'm just mastering them by 30

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:17.520
points

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.120
oh shane said he beat you right

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.199
so what i do is i keep the game at a

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:24.240
thing and i try to make little

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.759
challenges for myself out of it so i

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:26.000
have

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.800
shane up by 10 yeah in the fourth

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.840
quarter i'm like let me see if i could

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.080
tell

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.360
that one of the games i just wasn't able

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.760
to like close the gap just enough so

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.440
you're saying the entire time you

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.519
this is such an ex you just let shane

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:39.519
get up by the fact that they don't know

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.440
it blows my mind rob mayu i mean i would

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.959
have i would have fast breaks that i

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:44.000
would throw

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.839
ridiculous alley-oops on because i'm

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:46.959
like i don't want to just get the

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.080
obvious dunk here

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.360
i was like it's just two easy points and

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.279
he's gonna start getting frustrated

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:54.640
black loo this is a slap to both of our

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.760
if you want this proven though if you

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.440
want this proven that i'm right the gate

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.399
once like rob

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:00.800
uh mate once i realized i had him like

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.000
in with enough games

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.399
and then i mean i didn't lose to him by

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.839
less than 20 something

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:07.920
blackley what's up uh jay do you

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.279
remember the first time that we played

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:10.640
we won i did the same thing

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.440
excuse me you won i did the same exact

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:13.920
thing

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.360
so you're saying you're gonna buy me 30.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.920
you lose you want people to

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.320
you want to lose what did i say this

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.080
weeks ago by the way

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.000
how many do you want to be i take your

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.920
bets that i'll beat either of you by 20

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.800
points or more

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.160
oh please i mean i can't i i suck at

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.360
that game so i don't know

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.080
use all stars by the way and i'll use

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.279
today's sixers

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:38.320
you're being crazy christine who would

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.080
you lay money on that

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.519
okay she'll get hit

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.440
yeah that's why she paused why'd you

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.880
pause because

what am i going to say besides you oh

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.839
just and by the way just so we say this

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:50.560
because christine is

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.320
someone who doesn't give a [ __ ] at all

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.000
yeah but christine everything i've just

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.519

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.360
laughing phone call after any of these

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.000
how about you doing three randoms huh

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.320
how about playing 2k with three randoms

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.240
you want me to use the sixers

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.839
you want me to by chance get a

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:03.839
significantly better team

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:06.000
sure that's a really bad idea for you

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.440
dude if you got the rockets

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.279
i did it with shane by the way justino

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:11.519
with shane we did random teams

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:13.279
he's coming in we're gonna get coverage

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:15.200
from him yeah for sure

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.560
it's gonna break his heart and you know

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.680
why you're gonna see a look on his face

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.600
i feel like i know shane and he's gonna

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.360
go like he's not gonna accept it he's

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.560
gonna be like this shut up

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.320
shut up yeah shut up he's gonna be like

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.600
you [ __ ] don't know what you're

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.639
talking about that's what he's gonna

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:31.279
think

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:34.240
but in reality i completely understand

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.920
if black blue doesn't believe that i did

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.600
that last time we played

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.120
but i could almost guarantee and

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.720
christine's not gonna remember can i

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.920
but if i lost a black lou in a genuine

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.240
like i was going for a [ __ ] like win

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.320
yeah i would have been frustrated can i

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.839
tell you what i get that involved in it

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:50.639
but i i was like

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:53.279
would i lose shane didn't beat me a game

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:54.720
rob didn't beat me i don't think at all

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.560
but if it happens but when i lose those

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.920
games i'm like oh it was a good game

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.040
though man that's what's matter because

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.320
all i'm doing is trying to keep somebody

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.120
interested in playing

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.040
i think i have less skin in the game

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.160
because i can tell you right now what

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.920
i'm most excited for

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.600
is hoping that 7-eleven has those

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.279
assorted swedish fish they're go

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:12.000
oh the assorted sword is such a score

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.560
it's so

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.079
they don't taste any different yes they

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:16.000

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:24.079

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.880
it buzz

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.280

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.520
like

soak my bathroom mat and then soak like

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.440

wet footsteps to the floor like i'm

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.480
haunting the place yeah that's what it

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:52.799
was

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:54.799
uh all the way to yeah and then when you

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:56.000

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.120
wet on the floor you're like well that's

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.520
probably

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.039
[ __ ] something up or even worse when

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:00.720

it's like the ghost of your anger

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.360
because i was like oh man i was really

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.440

doing his job

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.200
wet socks that happened to me and this

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.559

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.080

before we get to four socks i just

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.080
thought of a good prank

because i hate wet socks if you make all

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:05.039
your friends take your shoes off and

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:06.720
then someone gets up to go

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.919
get something from the kitchen you put

00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:09.840
water where they're sitting on the yeah

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.039

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:13.280
feet

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.120

through this three times it got my socks

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.120

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.200
a pair of socks and then

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.799
the next day when i'd go to put socks

00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:34.080

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.039
where i had the other socks drying

00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:39.360

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:10.320
jay was in here earlier talking about

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.280
you guys playing nba 2k

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.560
why don't you explain to shane your

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.640
system that you said

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.480

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.800
i want to see his face also shane's

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.079
shane is gonna uh

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:25.599
do her uh he's doing a road gig with me

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:27.119
not too long from now

00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:29.599
and this is it's the reason this is all

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:30.960
set up is because i would like to

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.480
continue to play it's my favorite game

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.520
to play with somebody

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.720
nba 2k but you you can't find anybody

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.839
in your in your league talent more than

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:40.320
anything

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.040
oh i had a feeling this was coming yeah

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.000
yeah i'm telling you he's going to

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.240
realize it was the case

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.800
shane i kept shane in every game so he

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.400
wouldn't want to stop playing

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.599
yeah and then uh and then one but then i

00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:53.920
would

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.520
i said with these games i'll tend to set

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.040
challenges for myself where i let myself

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.960
get down by a few or whatever like

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.480
late in the game see if i can come back

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.280
i would be frustrated if i lost the game

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.880
if i lost the game that i was trying

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.400
very very hard to win

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.880
and then black lou brought up he goes uh

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.240
i don't remember the first time we

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:10.800
played

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.800
uh the game in uh

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.359
yeah i did the same thing i let him hang

00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:18.640
around the game then i [ __ ] i blew it

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.280
i blew

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.960
listen it's legitimate blowing at the

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.320
end for sure

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.520
i couldn't listen i'm not a magician i

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.560
couldn't close

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.960
15 10 15 points in like two minutes ago

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.599
but you

00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:32.320
you allowed shane to get those 15 points

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.200
right

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.359
a 20 point loss every single game if i

00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:36.960
wanted to that's what you could do to

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.400
shane every game

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.000
really every game with any team

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.920
we already took a 20-point bet for moon

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.760
tower when we go down there

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.280
dan can't believe he's going to lose by

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.119
20 points or more anything more he gets

00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:50.800
more money than the who's playing

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.839

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:09.040

runs i guess he just

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.040

first time we played

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.040

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.319
the game which i didn't so

00:44:14.319 --> 00:44:15.839
i took that as frustration yeah jay does

00:44:15.839 --> 00:44:18.880
hit very there's very obvious video game

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.400
frustration

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.359
my favorite my my favorite of all time

00:44:23.359 --> 00:44:24.800
is jay when jay tells you that the

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.560
computer likes you more than him yeah

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.400
or like the refs it's like dude it's a

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.800
video game the refs the reds are perfect

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.319
they're literally perfect they're

00:44:32.319 --> 00:44:33.520
algorithms i mean they're missing so

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.400
many calls

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.480
yeah because they they like you they're

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.920
at home this is where they live

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.040
yeah dude i think you're crazy i can be

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.400
you're certain i can't right come over

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.800
after your podcast tonight

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.800
facetime me immediately i'll face we can

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.480
facetime dan we'll face time in fourth

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.480
quarter and show what the score is

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.720
really all right

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.200
that's great he's nervous he's who's

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.800
nervous you are i think you are

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.920
[ __ ] dan sees in your heart i see it

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.040
if this was ncaa or madden i would be i

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:05.839
would feel like i

00:45:05.839 --> 00:45:07.520
i had something to defend this is 2k

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.839
dude i'm not a [ __ ] black teen

00:45:09.839 --> 00:45:12.960
oh all right i guess i am then yes

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.720
you did it i finally did it did the

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.160
thing you always wanted to do

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.839
a black team

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.000
um yeah no i bet matt and i said well

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.359
here's the difference though

00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:31.440
you and dan both played football

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.119
organized i did not

00:45:33.119 --> 00:45:36.160
so all the stuff in the game i've never

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.920
understood in madden hot routes

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.240
i'm bad at defense i let matt pick my

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.839
defense and all i try to do is get the

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:42.960
quarterback with the

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.680
line i play it every year um less and

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.560
less each year

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.760
and i and i can figure out about

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.440
you know i have like a handful you know

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.800
10 20

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.040
uh offensive plays that i run sure not

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.960
even maybe like maybe 15 plays i kind of

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:57.280
know

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.440
different what different guys do in each

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.800
play and figure that out

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.560
so i'm not terrible at madden but i'm

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.160
far from any kind of good at it

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.440
but i don't know anything about it i

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.400
don't know anything about organized

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.920
basketball i know as much about

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.839
basketball as i know about football

00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:11.359
which i know a lot i just know it from

00:46:11.359 --> 00:46:11.920
the streets

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.560
but i don't know like triangle offense

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.000
whatever like approaches

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
i so i don't do any of that [ __ ] i don't

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.280
do any of those things

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.480
so you want to know this do you want a

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.240
little secret about danny daniel click

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.839
hot routes and stuff

00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:28.880
he does cheat hot routes but hold

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.480
the last couple times we played we had

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.000
to we stopped playing matting because it

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:34.960
started

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.520
it started to affect us i was coming

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.040
over i was like hey thanks a lot for you

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:39.760
know

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.359
helping me out doing all this and then i

00:46:41.359 --> 00:46:43.920
[ __ ] him in madness

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.839
he's changing the strength is you flip

00:46:45.839 --> 00:46:47.440
teams that you just [ __ ] rail on

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.119
shane and then shane's going like that's

00:46:49.119 --> 00:46:50.960
[ __ ] are you used to the lineman the

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.240
whole time

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.160
this is like eating his quarterback's

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.280
lunch i'll play you right now

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.480

nfl broke me from super nintendo

00:56:44.079 --> 00:56:46.240
tecmo bowl because he would just be the

falcons

00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:48.480
he'd be like you could be any team you

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.559
want and then he would just go to dion

00:56:50.559 --> 00:56:51.839
and then he would do the coverage

00:56:51.839 --> 00:56:54.640
himself and he would intercept the ball

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.400
almost every time and then as he was

00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.760
running it back he'd just look at you

00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.319
and go

00:56:58.319 --> 00:57:02.240
prime time uh hurran

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:04.160

jackson's fast when you got dion

00:57:06.079 --> 00:57:07.920

with kevin hart used to have me come

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.799

00:57:12.799 --> 00:57:15.280
north philly friends playing nba live i

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.559
think it was that time still

00:57:16.559 --> 00:57:17.920
that was when live was way better than

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.920
2k did they beat you he talked [ __ ] the

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.200
whole time they would do a press

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.720
conference afterwards

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.880
gave speeches that's really funny it was

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.480
such an ordeal but uh uh

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:28.400
who actually was funny my friend john

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.520

bird my name was dr j versus bird on

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:40.240
atari

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.079
i thought it was uh jordan versus bird

00:57:42.079 --> 00:57:43.920
was on nintendo mine was dr j

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.359
bird i think on atari 7800 which had a

00:57:47.359 --> 00:57:50.319
weird controller yeah paddle and it was

00:57:50.319 --> 00:57:52.160
you know obviously plug-in cord

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:55.440
and my when that 7800 ended up going bad

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:55.760
it

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.000
i mean that thing became such like a

00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.440
ball like a mace

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.880
yeah when he would beat me over because

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.160
he he didn't play the game at all he

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.319
didn't even have atari 7 800.

00:58:04.319 --> 00:58:05.760

01:00:11.559 --> 01:00:14.480
oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] you

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.839
ah [ __ ] but dude we played ncaa and i

01:00:17.839 --> 01:00:19.359
would rock his [ __ ]

01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:22.960
and then occasionally he would be miami

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.799
and he would get one on me and i

01:00:24.799 --> 01:00:27.200
remember i was old miss with eli manning

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.960
and i had this [ __ ] there was a pla a

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.960
pass play called wide receiver under

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.839
where the x receiver dips under the slot

01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:34.720
route to go

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.640
up under the linebacker this is real

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.240
tech technical talk

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.079
and then the [ __ ] slot receiver goes

01:00:40.079 --> 01:00:41.359
in just a pure

01:00:41.359 --> 01:00:43.680
just uh you know deep bomb getting this

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.040

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.559
draw this up i want to call it in later

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.480
because i think we're gonna run this way

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.520
dude he [ __ ] picked it and then

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.280
ran it in to win the game and he had

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.520
this laugh where he goes oh

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.079
and i got up and [ __ ] what why i just

01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:02.079
put like three solid holes

01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:03.839
in the wall that was my stoned laugh all

01:01:03.839 --> 01:01:06.240
weekend with rob oh cause we smoked a

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.839
lot and just sitting there and as he's

01:01:07.839 --> 01:01:09.280
getting more and more frustrated tell me

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:09.760
there's

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.280
there's things i don't know i'm doing

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.960
that he doesn't know about and i'm just

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.240
giggling yeah yeah

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.960
you know the buttons oh he's like

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.240
no you definitely just know something i

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.400
don't know jay's offense is simple

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.880
he goes down and runs pick and rolls in

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.440
the paint

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.960
that's it runs pick and rolls in the

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.400
paint and then let's computer play

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.599
defense for him

01:01:29.599 --> 01:01:32.160
it's crazy yeah super easy and then

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.559
occasionally steals an inbound

01:01:34.559 --> 01:01:37.359
so frustrating it's so frustrating yeah

01:01:37.359 --> 01:01:38.319
but it's not really

01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:39.760

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.560
threshold

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:09.520

[ __ ] radio show about where their

if you shot a one laser into a specific

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.480
part of the death star it would blow up

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.239
that joke on blue harvest is still the

01:10:56.239 --> 01:10:58.320

adult it's been a long time

01:12:39.679 --> 01:12:41.679
it's been a pretty long time i used to

01:12:41.679 --> 01:12:43.520
when i was younger i used to

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.280
i said i started doing stand-up comedy

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.600

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.719
happened

01:12:48.719 --> 01:12:50.640
i built a callus to it from when i was

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.480
like a kid

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.239

01:12:54.239 --> 01:12:55.600
late teenager if i

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.880
if i found something that funny and

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.640
laughed that hard i would have to stop

01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.920
myself from pissing a little i think

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.800
that's

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.400
a little i think it's so great mine was

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.159
always breathing i couldn't breathe if i

01:13:04.159 --> 01:13:05.679
laughed too hard i'd be like i can't

01:13:05.679 --> 01:13:06.480
breathe

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.960
really so like i was like i'm fine but

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.719

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.480

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.880

l.a because i want to be on instagram

01:15:48.159 --> 01:15:50.239

instagram's all over the world

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.000
i mean l.a because that's where

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.239
instagram is it's only there and that's

01:15:58.239 --> 01:15:59.600
what my ex-boyfriend told me and that's

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.440
why i moved away

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.360
he tricked me out of living where we

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.480
lived because

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.040
i was like come to instagram yeah come

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:07.600
over here

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.880
come come over i live in instagram

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.320
well come here let's talk about it i

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.400
could probably get you reinstatements

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.760
oh yeah is your account not around

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:19.600
he goes well i mean you know we could

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.960
always negotiate something and get you

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.320
back up you know

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.120
thank you jim instagram oh my god he

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.360
can't believe your dad robert instagram

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:27.920
created

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.120
instagram and turned it over to you and

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:31.760
he died

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.080
tragically and the only way you can

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.159
restore accounts is by blow jobs that

01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:36.480
are

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:39.120
really sloppy i can really appreciate

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.880
this not how you want to do it but it's

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:44.159
how you have to do it

01:16:44.719 --> 01:16:48.560
this trick stinks yeah keep going i

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:52.960

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:57.520
oh just a sack of lips and eyes

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.480
yes because i'm just a hole in the mouth

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:01.360

is how many photos she's got

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.400
but it wasn't that many i bet she posts

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.280
some pretty high pictures

01:17:15.679 --> 01:17:18.159

she's so broken up by the instagram fans

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:31.679
more than because this is

01:31:31.679 --> 01:31:33.199

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:35.840
famous for like

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:38.639
social media that guys think ralph had

and just did their tour bus with her

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.000
they ended up booting her off in the

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.440
middle of nowhere

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.400
kicked her off the bus because they were

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.840
