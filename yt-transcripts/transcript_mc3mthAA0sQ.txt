I've always hated all of them dude yeah

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.610
I don't think there's ever been a DJ T

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.260

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.650
sick what yeah what's this guy about

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.279
trashing people

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:38.750
well do that and that's the thing now on

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.459
people the fact that people can even

00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:43.310
pretend like to like politicians it's

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.159
like do they have all

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.709
information you know exactly how we feel

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:48.329
when they go to campaign all of our

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:49.769
information is out on the internet and

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:51.329
literally Google and Facebook sells it

00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:54.930
to the campaigners so dude you shouldn't

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.519
be on the air dude literally so it's

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:57.839
like when they're like oh this guy gets

00:08:57.839 --> 00:08:58.889
it you saw him well exactly what I'm

00:08:58.889 --> 00:08:59.879
thinking of he's like yeah cuz you've

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:02.069
read the aggregate data from all of your

00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:03.810
[ __ ] status isn't that regional area

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.329
dude get this get you hat do you know

00:09:06.329 --> 00:09:08.399
what Google Street View is yes do you

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:09.629
know do you would you are you familiar

00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:10.800
with like the controversy that

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.680
surrounded it no so when those when

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.149
those cars were driving around remember

00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:16.139
they drove around their little thing

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:17.250
yeah they still do yeah they were

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.230
pulling [ __ ] Wi-Fi data they were

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.970
pulling data out around oh my god

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.800
they're pulling data web history

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.110
passwords your names address all that

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.470
[ __ ]

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:32.149
so they're off and then I would search

00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:35.040
everyone's like oh yeah it looks it off

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.230
and then go back to try to find it never

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.879
found it well they [ __ ] they

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:40.740
definitely blocked it out dude so they

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.149
were they they were they went through

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:44.579
there they definitely censored dude

00:09:44.579 --> 00:09:46.560
we're getting literally we're getting

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.839
destroyed or people have no idea what

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:50.160
they're feeling so there was going

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.810
around and just lock it like the Ninja

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.459
Turtles was a bad guys thing that's the

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.350
big guy on it yeah it was just rolling

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.480
around pulling all of our Wi-Fi data out

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.370
across going Street the street to go

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.660
away cool I'm gonna be a leader net so

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.220
then picture needs to be on the Internet

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.399
a blurry pixelated picture of me for

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.889
like four years ago so then they got in

00:10:10.889 --> 00:10:13.410
trouble someone a hacker figured this

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.730
out it was like this is what they're up

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.639
to and Google was like no not and he was

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:18.779
like yeah now here's the proof and

00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:19.649
they're like oh yeah

00:10:19.649 --> 00:10:24.180
our bad we don't know doing literally go

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.939
oh that was actually retasked one person

00:10:26.939 --> 00:10:29.069
to set that all up and that was a bug

00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:30.899
like who's the one person they're like

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:35.550
yeah you know we're not gonna say so so

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.019
then that went on that people were like

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:39.209
there was people in like like Ireland

00:10:39.209 --> 00:10:41.040
and England like blockading the Google

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.839
car there's people who are like they're

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:47.490
[ __ ] search history was so bad that

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.009
they set up like the [ __ ] apocalypse

00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:50.879
blockades and they can do this thing the

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:52.559
[ __ ] out of here that's awesome oh it's

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:56.430
fantastic so then what happened was they

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.930
eventually least someone got a hold

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.100
the name of the engineer who's in charge

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.230
of setting up the Google Maps at dock

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.350
sir he got docks so that guy this is a

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.820
book I'm reading like they followed that

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.740
guy so they never like did anything to

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.360
him eventually you got transferred to

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.220
one of Google's alphabet companies and

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.470
guess what this guy guess what app this

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.270
guy designed in the company what a

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.300
pokemons go I'm just sayin bro so you

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.440
can't have the car so you have people

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.730
walk around their cell phones record

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.649
everything to him and you set the

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:24.690
location that they walked to yeah like

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.730
hey go fight here yeah dude

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.770
so that was an experiment modifying user

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.810
behavior because what they want to do is

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.790
set your Google map to where like they

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.339
can be like hey we notice you've been

00:11:35.339 --> 00:11:38.250
searching a like countertops a lot when

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.570
you're going somewhere you will see an

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.920
alternate route in the car and it's

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.360
leading you to a [ __ ] counter tops

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.680
yeah man that's what the [ __ ] that's

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.480
what they're up to their googles mission

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.060
is to cover what they say their mission

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.240
is is to like cover every inch of the or

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.950
like to index all of the world's

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.270
information and they're like well we

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.970
have to do a cover like the the terrain

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.649
as well and all they're doing is saying

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:02.610
they're doing that and it's trying to

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.589
pull everyone's Wi-Fi data and the cell

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:07.950
it [ __ ] up dude damn insane and dude

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.120
it they they literally if you're running

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.730
for office now you just call Google and

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.779
you're like ooh girls like yeah we can

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:14.700
give what do you think I should I say to

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.410
win in this district I'm in South I'm

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.120
and I'm in Arizona what you know what's

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.160
trending and you hire Google contractors

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.060
and they're like all right we'll check

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.740
you into the frame all right here you go

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.720
and then Trump calls and he's like oh

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.800
I'm just gonna make fun of Rosie

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.690
O'Donnell like that's actually gonna

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:31.320
cross that's gonna be awesome

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.390
yeah dude so that's that's what's been

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.160
going on so we've literally traded in

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.920
all of our basically our information and

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.209
see which isn't a big deal but in the

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:41.100
aggregate it's [ __ ] crazy to give away

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.959
all that stuff and all we've gotten

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:46.380
forward arbitrary internet things like I

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.480
don't like GPS no no I thought about

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.250
that I'm not talking about that

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.750
I'm talking about like like since we're

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.910
rewarded like which literally are

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.560
another mechanism for like tracking you

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.480
to like if you like something in a lot

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.110
of those looks

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.190
every time you like something and

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.870
installs cookies and you're computing

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.730
love those legs yeah

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.949
yeah yeah it is funny the trade-off is

00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:06.959
like they got billions of dollars and

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:08.310
we're just like [ __ ] yeah I got 40 for

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.089

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.820
like you know Hilda we tried slithered

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.740
out yeah you people did keep that going

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.210
oh my god this is crazy they'd [ __ ]

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.780
Benghazi yeah I support Hill dog with

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.220
Benghazi do you really yeah

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.260
what was the move nothing they didn't do

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.670
anything they knew I think they knew

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.350
there was gonna be an attack III don't

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.750
think see Hill dog could possibly have

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.490
been held responsible for that

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.320
she was just ahead of they knew there

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.550
was attack we didn't they not pulled him

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.830
out or something hit solve if that were

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.680
me I'm saying follows he'll dog I'd be

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.330
like get me a [ __ ] helicopter drop me

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.740

well thanks in front of your [ __ ] BAE

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.600
I can't I can't think of what getting

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.310
called a [ __ ] white devil and then

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.940
becoming a white guy just speak his name

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.330
and he shall appear dude devil yeah man

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:42.000
all down the dog I'm telling you it's

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.040
really they they s they're so used to

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.990
seeing people who are like like around

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.000
here yeah I remember like my dog's a pee

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.440
outside if you like you're gonna clean

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.000
it up I'm like it's [ __ ] piss and

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.690
they're like are used to deal with 18

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:56.550
year olds like I'm sorry I'm sorry that

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:01.770
I'm interfering in your space I'm not

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.360
[ __ ] with that dude I got it I got

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.610
attacked in my class recently all the

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:06.960
[ __ ] [ __ ] do you really

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.740
dude they did a study and the worst part

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.930
is is like well either I'll tell you the

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:17.010
study so the study was people so that it

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.390
was specifically the studies like

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.970
specifically among African American kids

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.280
this is the title are less likely to be

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.250
anxious when they have higher measures

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:30.150
of ethnic pride so I go okay reading the

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.570
study all it was was that they said like

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.640
so if you took a black kid and their

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.350
parents accepted them they were less

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.490
likely to have anxiety

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.130
makes sense of course and then they

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:42.840
correlated like in what also correlates

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.510
is ethnic pride which we also say is

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.090
someone accepting themselves and a

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:49.850
subplot also accepting their ethnicity

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.620
so is this really vague definition of

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.270
like and they're trying to be like the

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.280
more the more ethnic pride you have the

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.660
less anxious you are the more your

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.710
parents are nice to do the more I think

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.170
pride you have sorry dude just genuinely

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.600
raised my hand I was like whoa so like

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.550
my parents like accepted me like why I'm

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.960
not sure I'd be like super stoked I'm

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.370
like being white and they're like I'm

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.080
like I'm not like mad at the study I'm

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.060
saying it's [ __ ] it makes no [ __ ]

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.940
sense you know all the it's all very

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.650
loose the way it's done I'm like when

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:20.970
you're doing a scientific study this is

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:22.260
social science is so funny because it's

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.050
like you like the variables are supposed

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:27.090
to be like speed weight that's what

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.800
science is made for when you put into

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.750
Social Sciences it's like ethnic pride

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.700
and so what how do you wanna fly that

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.170
well it doesn't make any sense and it's

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.750
like I'm just [ __ ] weird now it sounds

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.000
like and like to me it sounds like they

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.890
just did a regular old anxiety study and

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.240
they were like how can we make this

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.830
about black people and it's like because

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:44.760
they're like an underserved population

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.530
whatever but at the same time it was

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.210
like you guys are trying to get [ __ ]

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.920
published because it's a cheek right now

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.630
that's this is a science that this quote

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.490
science I'm reading and it was like the

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:56.160
lady dude the teacher goes uh she was

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:56.820
like wool

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.590
she was like well they don't mean like

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.000
race in mean ethnicity I'm like hold

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.340
there yeah but they're saying like you

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.170
know I'm like so I recite alien she's

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.940
like I'm guessing you're Irish right no

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.160
like literally teacher says that I'm

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.230
like yeah like why and she was like I'm

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.970
saying it's like you know and she kind

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:13.770
of gave like a like a I roll thing and

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.020
I'm like what the [ __ ] is this oh I'm

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.250
getting [ __ ] attacked and I with my

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:18.720
head um all I said I'm like it just

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.250
seems click baby that's all it seems

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:22.470
like they had a regular old anxiety

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.330
study and then they added ethnic pride

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.130
in there which is a weird I'm like it

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.600
was just weird to think about a

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.370
scientific study supposed to translate

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.770
to other popular you have pride in your

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:34.260
ethnicity you have lower anxiety that's

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.430
what they're saying I'm like that's a

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.110
[ __ ] slippery so I'm saying like

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:38.670
that's a weird [ __ ] thing to be

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:39.990
pushing out there and it doesn't if

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:42.720
you're to flip that study it's just kind

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.060
of like like white if I'm like it so

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.400
we're gonna like ethnic pride amongst

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.310
like him European Americans is increased

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:51.690
when you're a parent it's like dude what

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:51.970
the

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.340
doing that's awesome white nationalists

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.580
have no anxiety I get it that makes

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:57.970
sense

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.889
they probably walk around like yeah I'm

00:32:59.889 --> 00:33:03.970
the [ __ ] best I am a Superman yes oh

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:05.740
that makes sense fear dude I get [ __ ]

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:06.970
I give it every one and then dude

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.169
there's always someone in my class who's

00:33:08.169 --> 00:33:10.990
like um actually like what whiteness is

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.909
ubiquitous in American like someone

00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:14.889
those people like a peanut gallery of

00:33:14.889 --> 00:33:17.230
like um actually and I'll to sit there

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:18.970
I'm like yeah yeah I know what I'm

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:20.350
saying is it's a [ __ ] weird study

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.299
this I'm like how does that translate to

00:33:22.299 --> 00:33:24.159
any other parties doing that Nike is

00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:28.659
using that like ethnicity thing real

00:33:28.659 --> 00:33:30.460
strong right now it's real weird really

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:34.990
there's a billboard right by compound

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:38.110
where I go to [ __ ] a fair one there's

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.240
this giant billboard and it's pretty

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.370
sick pictures but it's also like it's a

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:43.629
Nike billboard in the middle of

00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:45.669
basically like Times Square it's huge

00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:47.710
but every time there I noticed that

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.149
obviously they only have black athletes

00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:51.850
as their but oh no never mind they have

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.129
a lot of female athletes they even have

00:33:54.129 --> 00:33:56.019
like a [ __ ] one of the slides because

00:33:56.019 --> 00:33:59.740
it's a slide show type and yeah I don't

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.330
know how it was I don't you talking

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.070
about like it's electronic yeah the

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.840
picture changes every like 30 seconds

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.809
yeah even though like the skateboarding

00:34:07.809 --> 00:34:10.389
one's a black skateboarder you know like

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:11.800
it's like come on give us computable

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.099
take one who was a guy there's a guy

00:34:15.099 --> 00:34:18.700
from Tony Hawk the black yeah no I think

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.579
it's a BMX guy actually pretty good

00:34:21.579 --> 00:34:23.879
right that's crossing the [ __ ] line

00:34:23.879 --> 00:34:27.520
take my bicycle I bested you know why

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.929
people have best doing tricks in the air

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:34.030
and Rick's but uh one of them's there's

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:37.750
a Muslim lady who's a fencer Olympian

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.760
fencer sir pull from the fence he's got

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.179
a [ __ ] Nike turban it's got a Nike

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:46.000
hat yeah it's pretty sick that's pretty

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.069
tight but she's good she's good at what

00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:51.369
kind of sword is she she's just curvy

00:34:51.369 --> 00:34:55.040
and ideas yeah she beheads them

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.690
she has a one move it's a broad stripe

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.849
brother swipe to the top yeah her

00:34:59.849 --> 00:35:01.079
opponents have to be kneeling and

00:35:01.079 --> 00:35:05.220
handcuffed she fights people with a

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:09.240
potato sack or thigh holes so it's that

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.270
and every ad is like they said you're a

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:13.890
woman and you can't do it and it's a

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:16.079
picture Serena it's like the badass girl

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:18.359
from Compton sold a picture of Serena

heading yeah that's a that's a culture

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.070
mat that you need to learn to accept

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:46.310
exactly as a white man you need to learn

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:47.930
to be a little more open to cultures

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.580
dude don't get me started around when I

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.200
talked about female genital mutilation

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.840
class when they talked about that we

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.760
don't like you know it's just a cultured

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.080
only what about female gentlemen I can't

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.250

groans I walked after those billboards

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.620
every time right before I go into

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:24.150

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:26.610
compound media like this is wild I work

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.500

belly of the [ __ ] alt right movement

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.130
sure somewhat like that's where the

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.560
proud boys started that's where like you

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.090

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.220
like it's kind of yep so we share dick

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.200

which you know that's a little weird but

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:47.910
uh this is risky and then I'll see that

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.200

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:51.120
honestly say this it doesn't make a

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.010
difference I made it I'm in my program

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:55.380

so I just start you know I'm like you

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:10.980
got you I was like this whole programs

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.630
the [ __ ] echo chamber of just the

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:14.640
same [ __ ] opinion over and over and

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.220
over dude I'm [ __ ] listen I just got

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.480
an argument about Charles the charles

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.370
murray study and it's like about how

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.110
they're trying to conflate the science

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.820
with social policy which you know kind

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.710
of got from sam harris i felt like you

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:27.090
know so i just like listen to [ __ ]

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.590
they don't understand i listen to so

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.180
much [ __ ] content they don't listen

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:30.670
to any

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.980
all they do is go my whole argument was

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:33.910
like you're getting your information

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:37.330
about a scientific study from equip in

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:39.760
the New York Times I'm like that and I'm

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.900
like so you gotta go we're gonna engage

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.340
conservative thing I'm like I'm not even

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.050
[ __ ] conservative but I'm like I'm

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:45.610
paying money to be in this place and

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:47.620
like it's an embarrassment the depth of

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.120
like the way you guys try to argue

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.530
against stuff by just being like it's

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:53.080
[ __ ] racist dude I'm literally going

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.520
I'm going into it and then I'm like you

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.960
said you have to even if you think this

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.520
guy's racist at least read the science

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.260
before you argue it do people I don't

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.640
have to read anything from someone who's

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.750
racist up some like I saw you know I'm

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:05.650
going back and forth

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.600
teachers like well we did disprove the

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.190
science I'm like you [ __ ] read an

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.780
article you read equip in an article and

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.220
use that to disprove a science his books

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.230
800 [ __ ] pages so you didn't have

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.550
your qualms with his social policy

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.590
whatever but like you can't like this is

football program to run so the so we're

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.240
sitting there we're going back and forth

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.560
everyone's hate know how many dude I'm

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.810
[ __ ] I'm going in I don't even go into

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:06.250
the fact that all their political

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.570
beliefs are feeding into like a

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:08.950
mechanism that's trying to control them

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:10.690
through social media that they say they

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.250
[ __ ] hate capitalism yet they feed

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.660
the most aggressive form of capitalism

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.100
which is gotten Google and Facebook

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.600
whatever take that out of the equation

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.890
take that out take that out of the

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:20.260
redact that racket that for now let's

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:23.920
put a pin in that I mean I'm getting

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.380
slimed by that you always use bracket

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.320
that slimed used to be let's put a pin

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:29.620
in that

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.180
let's put nice put a pin in that he goes

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:32.980
and then we go him in whoo every song

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.570
about like I think now we're at the meat

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.400
of the issue I think we're at the actual

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.380
course of the reactor of this issue it's

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.300
like you're just [ __ ] talking shut up

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.200
O'Conner steals

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.000
does he really O'Conner uses a ton of

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.590
Samaria now we're at the core of the

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:46.240
reactor of the rods of the issue not

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.430
making contact with reality with what

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:50.230
we're discussing that's go ahead now

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:51.520
yeah I'd like to get back to that first

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.750
point you made in that argument cuz

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:58.060
there's a lot to unpack here so in this

00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.440
and go back to that first point you made

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.780
may they all do digs and they they're

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.550
like well I think you might be a little

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:05.200
sensitive but I'm not gonna say dude

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.060
it's so [ __ ] funny so I'm like you

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.070
know so I'm I'm I'm as being like look

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:10.450
all you have you have to be able to

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:12.190
engage information as it comes and you

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:13.870
can't be like that's racist and just

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:15.940
block data like you know you can't do

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.310
that and it's it's not data that I'm

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:19.090
like all right whatever

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:20.980
oh but Charles Mary the one thing they

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.900
said against him is like because he's

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.550
like look man you know my whole thing I

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:27.250
studied IQ race does come up and it does

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:29.260
it comes up and all that stuff but then

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.940
his second book right after that was

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.320
basically white guys invented everything

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.750
he did it he broke down the date of like

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:36.850
kinky contributions to society so he

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:38.380
followed up his thing with what yeah

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:42.100
that's I was like [ __ ] trying to help

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.320
you bro yeah so his next book after that

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.820
was according to this guy Ezra Klein

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.490
again people do definitely you know take

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:49.960
liberties with his work someone should

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.340
have pulled me aside of me like yo dude

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.260
everyone knows you don't need to write a

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.930
book yeah why dude's invented everything

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.840
all right we know don't follow that up

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.590
but he was the [ __ ] happen with him so

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:04.810
yeah so then oh so his so the reason he

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:06.370
gets into such hot water is because he's

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:07.900
been he's been a proponent of like

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.250
stopping what ending welfare he's

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:11.230
worried about dis Genesis which is when

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:14.680
people like the basically people with

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.480
low IQs across groups that's who they

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.540
say across groups all across every group

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:21.250
are having more kids than people with

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:23.200
high IQs yeah within that group so

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.390
Murray's kind of like it's gonna be a

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:27.250
[ __ ] problem dude yeah it's you know

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:28.900
it's called it's like we're slowly you

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.670
know and it you know gets eugenic II so

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:32.470
it's slippery it's real mucky waters

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.210
urine but he wrote an 800-page book

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:37.540
about like basically IQ is this weird

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:39.460
measure of intelligence so like yeah it

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.900
does have predictive qualities but it's

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.060
also like now it's just out of nowhere

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.740
became how you become paid if you have a

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.780
high IQ you can pretty much for the most

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.550
part get paid and get money if you don't

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:50.200
you're kind of [ __ ] he was saying it's

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.090
basically being like you know like it's

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:53.230
like being an NFL lineman

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:54.790
it's like saying like yeah it's not the

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:55.870
most important thing in the world but

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:57.250
like if you're gonna be an NFL lineman

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:58.870
you got to be 300 pounds if you're gonna

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:02.560
be like a astrophysicist you need to be

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:05.110
[ __ ] you know certain IQ yeah so

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:06.220
that's all he's saying he's I'm you got

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.810
to watch out building a society that's

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:09.040
based on all this stuff but he's been

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.020
trying to end welfare for a long time so

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:12.490
people took all those things and were

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:14.320
like he's saying black people are dumb

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.050
and we should say [ __ ] oh wow what in

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:18.430
his book he's and his whole thing is

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:20.380
that he should we should do he's a big

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.480
proponent of you bi so he wants to do a

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.890
universal basic income instead of

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:26.140
welfare so that that's the dude you know

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.510
in a very tight nutshell but like I'm so

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:30.280
I'm like no one in my school knows any

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.360
any of this they're just gonna he's a

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.360
[ __ ] raisin so we're in class the

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.740

a you know also I mean they're also out

01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:01.420
here kicking around [ __ ] to the

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.760
harmful stereotypes but yeah we from

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.469
some Asians who are stereotypically

01:18:05.469 --> 01:18:07.840
about to eat it usually not to eat that

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.630
Corgi through that'd be a sick like I

01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:12.580
bet that coordinated might be a sick

01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:14.230
midnight like Sarah McLachlan commercial

01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:17.040
she's like you know how Asia's eat dogs

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.719
stop them from doing that 50 cents a

01:18:19.719 --> 01:18:22.300
month you could stop Asians from eating

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:24.580
dogs and also an additional dollar will

01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:31.690
revoke their driver's license man you

01:18:31.690 --> 01:18:32.770
think you should be saying that's what

01:18:32.770 --> 01:18:34.120
they are that's the kind of [ __ ] they're

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.350
putting out there with this [ __ ]

01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:37.750
self-congratulatory dog program just say

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:39.010
you rescued don't think yeah won't you

01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:42.100
[ __ ] Asians are hungry Asians or

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:44.409
licking their chops it's a beautiful dog

01:18:44.409 --> 01:18:45.900
and we rescued it

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:48.010
goddamn because I figured the dog was

01:18:48.010 --> 01:18:48.790
expensive

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:50.920
they said South Asia or North or South

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:55.290
Korea they said it was a Korean where

01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:57.370
dirty south I didn't think it was a

01:18:57.370 --> 01:18:59.080
robot I mean I know it's real dirty the

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.489
South obviously they're not rescuing

01:19:00.489 --> 01:19:02.469
[ __ ] North Korean dogs you know be

01:19:02.469 --> 01:19:03.969
your [ __ ] slap in the face yeah

01:19:03.969 --> 01:19:05.590
because those people are starving we

01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:07.099
should let them eat their dogs

01:19:07.099 --> 01:19:09.440
that's true they can best friends the

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:10.880
one Asian group that I'm like here go

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:35.900
delicious dog so I can't imagine if it

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:37.429

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.400
start like oh my Korean Bistro it's just

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.710

01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:14.270
actually a traditional meal and just get

01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:15.770

traditional dog dogs very traditional

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:26.090

eating your dog number one you're racist

01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:49.310
number two we like dogs more than North

01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:50.960
Korean people are eating their own kind

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.030
right now to avoid being called racist

01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:55.040

01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:45.150
awesome playlist I know you see uh the

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:47.219
Democrats are trying to lower the voting

01:21:47.219 --> 01:21:50.250
age to what to 16th okay cuz they know

01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:51.719
everybody young is gonna vote Democrat

01:21:51.719 --> 01:21:54.360
so they're like sixteen year olds are

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:58.530
smart drop the drinking age to I don't

01:21:58.530 --> 01:22:00.179
know it should that mean they have to at

01:22:00.179 --> 01:22:02.310
this point but how great is that

01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:04.739
they're trending Bob could you drive me

01:22:04.739 --> 01:22:06.090
to go vote right now yeah they're trying

01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:08.340
to destroy the electoral college because

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.810
it cost them the election and now

01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:11.159
they're trying to lower they're trying

01:22:11.159 --> 01:22:12.929
to get more votes by saying you should

01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:14.840
be able to vote when you're sixteen

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:17.159
didn't Bush lose close or did he win

01:22:17.159 --> 01:22:18.570
because the electoral college Bush won

01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:19.920
cuz of the college closer to college I'm

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.389
down with destroying the college yeah

01:22:21.389 --> 01:22:22.679
there's actually a lot of people that

01:22:22.679 --> 01:22:24.780
are saying it's a good idea but it is

01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:26.969
funny to be like since we lost so like

01:22:26.969 --> 01:22:29.460
yeah this is crazy thing that makes no

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:31.530
[ __ ] sense it's time for it to go

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:33.510
yeah yeah it's [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah

01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:35.159
they tried to blame Roscoe the electoral

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:37.110
college and key now they're trying to

01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:39.929
lower it to get more kids to vote pretty

01:22:39.929 --> 01:22:41.310
great they got it put they gotta start

01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:42.510
putting like a little like hookah set

01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:44.730
and then the Republicans are like you

01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:46.920
need to have a ID to vote I thought

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:48.510
that's races and you're trying to it cuz

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:50.250
it's you know that's cost em boats true

01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:53.310
yeah pretty fun so wait you can you can

01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:56.100
you vote without an ID yeah there's

01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.889
always like voter ID laws that are

01:22:57.889 --> 01:22:59.940
apparently designed to keep black dudes

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:03.300
away from voting my D they said black

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.969
people don't have IDs so saying that you

01:23:05.969 --> 01:23:08.520
need an ID to vote is racist but if you

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.690
don't have an ID you could just vote a

01:23:09.690 --> 01:23:11.969
hundred times willy-nilly all right no I

01:23:11.969 --> 01:23:14.610
doubt it I'm sure there's a computer but

01:23:14.610 --> 01:23:16.920
then you need to prove who you are who

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.230
you are to exactly like I could go steal

01:23:19.230 --> 01:23:21.300
I don't know enough about voter ID laws

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.730
to have a problem with it but if the

01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:25.560
only thing is you need an ID to vote

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.840
well I'm sure I'm sure they someone

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.770
somewhere put measures to block

01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:31.840
black people from voting yeah I mean

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.520
they've done it definitely yeah but you

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.760
do need a [ __ ] a quarter yes Mike

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.230
yeah you need a [ __ ] driver's license

01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:39.940
bra or state ID

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.620
I got an argument with my woke ass

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.810
roommate about this about voter ID laws

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:45.010
he's like you know how hard it is to get

01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:47.530
an ID I was like whoa presidential

01:23:47.530 --> 01:23:49.420
elections are every four years so if I

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:51.220
have four years to get an ID and I

01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.140
needed to vote if I wanted to vote badly

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:55.300
enough I could do it I could get an ID

01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:57.190
he's like they're expensive I'm like 20

01:23:57.190 --> 01:24:00.760
bucks 30 bucks yeah if you want to vote

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.980
that bad you can get even yeah 30 bucks

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:05.050
also I just save it up over four years

01:24:05.050 --> 01:24:07.180
that's mine this is my thing dude and

01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:08.860
this is where I'd attached you to people

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:11.290
from my school where it's like they

01:24:11.290 --> 01:24:13.750
almost go against free will where it's

01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:15.040
like yeah we have to help people we

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.540
can't assume everyone can work I get

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.250
that but at the end of the day there is

01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:19.870
a choice like you're saying if I really

01:24:19.870 --> 01:24:21.940
want to vote I'm gonna go out there and

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:23.980
do my little Mario boarding at 20 bucks

01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:26.230
so I also it's like imagine being like

01:24:26.230 --> 01:24:28.180
dedicating yourself and like if that was

01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:30.220
such a [ __ ] mountain to climb and

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:32.560
then going and like I finally voted to

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.610
be such a disappointment

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:35.200
you'd be like oh wait [ __ ] we lost god

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:38.680
dammit god dammit I mean dude I I don't

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.380
I'm uh I forgot he was to say that I

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:42.490
don't know if it was Socrates and one of

01:24:42.490 --> 01:24:44.500
them was like I don't know if I'm about

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:48.390
the whole like mm wisdom of the masses

01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:51.250
to be like we need we didn't have enough

01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:52.450
people need a vote I'm like yeah I think

01:24:52.450 --> 01:24:53.980
people are [ __ ] [ __ ] evil or

01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:55.870
[ __ ] [ __ ] let's literally all it

01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:57.520
is is people that the candidates play

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.560
like [ __ ] chess and they're like the

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:04.090
security morons over here say they're

01:25:04.090 --> 01:25:06.370
that all it is is stoking morons yes

01:25:06.370 --> 01:25:08.230
that's why I talked about how we could

01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:10.090
win we need the [ __ ] party the

01:25:10.090 --> 01:25:12.070

01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:13.180
to be the black vote announced or

01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.740
whoever can swing the [ __ ] vote

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.630

01:25:16.630 --> 01:25:20.950
well WWF the departed's or devote hard

01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:22.600
yeah but the [ __ ] votes caught
