what up everybody welcome to episode oh

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.690
man let me say episode 3 of Psych nah

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.450
sorry I'm trying to share my screen

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.980
people listening on audio sorry about

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.839
that this is gonna be a uncomfortable

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.850
experience for you here we go

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.430
BAM I'm using this uh presentation

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.810
software so you should probably watch

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.210
the video but you know you're using if

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.359
you're a guy using your hands out there

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.010
you can listen it's fine get home

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.000
check out the vid I made a little

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.520
presentation on Prezi it's like a

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.000
PowerPoint with cool effects so the last

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.739
one we we had another guest who came on

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.260
incognito and gave us uh gave us the the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.090
general view of act

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.910
what's acceptance and commitment therapy

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.350
which you know the more I read about I'm

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.730
like damn this [ __ ] is so [ __ ] cool I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.469
even actually I got to talk to the guy

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.489
who the guy who founded this whole

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.140
modality of Theory Steven C Hayes he was

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.430
I just emailed him and he was nice

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.949
enough to talk to me for two hours and I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.479
told him the project he's down with it

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.479
you know he he's all about it he's from

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.159
what's known as like the third wave of

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.430
CBT but you don't have to get really

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.650
into but he you know he got into CBT and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.049
he kind of in my opinion revolutionized

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.869
a whole branch of psychology and then

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.280
came up with his own mode out he based

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.560
on this other theory called rft which

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.270
won't get into as I go through this

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.299
guy's book but the dudes a [ __ ]

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.890
genius man and all the stuffs backed up

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.860
through like rigorous scientific studies

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.340
but you know I'm

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.899
the [ __ ] works it works I don't really

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.219
care too much about the scientific data

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.280
but it is cool that you know if people

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.500
are like you know this works it's like

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.789
yeah there's lookup there's like there's

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.319
like hundreds if not thousands of

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.079
studies saying that this these methods

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.829
for helping to elicit positive change in

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.049
people's life actually works and it's

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.819
been peer it's been empirically verified

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.090
so you know if you got a science boner

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.250
consider it sucked by me cuz I just did

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.600
it but you know even if you don't care

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.890
about it that's the cool thing to a lot

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.599
of things in psychology either appealed

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.700
like this like you know BF Skinner was

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.739
the guy who would like shock mice and he

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.840
came up with behaviorism so a lot of

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.340
it's like Freud which is like this

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.209
people are like what are they talking

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.610
about like myths and your dad's boner

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.829
and then there's like BF Skinner which

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.239
is like controlling behavior so the

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.459
fields kind of split between like you

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.660
know people who are like more or less

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.370
just like writing poetry and then people

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.079
who are like out here trying to do like

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.860
algebra on people and I think Hayes in

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.700
my opinion he did a good job unifying

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.670
like the impossible things that to nail

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.470
down and people like in terms of like

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.209
human psyche and like why do people do

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.739
the things they do and then also but

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.209
making it so it's not just some lady

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.620
holding a crystal over your head and

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.760
being like you're healed now what you

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.489
know these things can devolve into

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.959
hopefully that makes sense so I have

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.310
three little dots I'm gonna go through

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.400
my little Prezi slide so first we'll go

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.079
into the group's because I want to say

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.209
how I think the groups are gonna work so

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.849
look at that BAM zoomed in all right so

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:05.870
this is how I think the groups are gonna

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.209
go and after talking to a couple people

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.290
couple professionals um I got steered

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.540
away from doing trying to do like you

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.090
know my original idea was like well if

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.620
you just combined four people they can

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.319
just do therapy on each other and I was

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.090
warned away from that by for this reason

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.510
basically that um well you know you just

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.620
never know who you're dealing with

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.900
so you get like you know you might just

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.790
have four average Joes just like yeah

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.019
you know sometimes you get pissed off

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.060
sometimes to do this but like there

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.470
could be somebody who got like molested

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.790
or something or something really [ __ ]

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.200
up happened who comes in there and just

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.510
lays all this like super heavy [ __ ] on

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.459
some average Joes and it's like dude

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.720
even professionals have a hard time

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.689
dealing with this [ __ ] so it's like

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:49.189
after being warned away from like hey

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:50.960
man like everyone's got their own [ __ ]

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.130
you know when people [ __ ] trigger and

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.140
other people [ __ ] and to just like for

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.240
people having a meltdown on zoom' and

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.580
being like what the [ __ ] was that so

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.990
what I've been told to do and I really

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.580
do agree with this and it's funny

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.690
because it actually aligns perfectly

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.230
with the the the act stuff is putting

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.110
this into skills based groups right here

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.140
you see these are skills based so using

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.360
act as a theory

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.860
they're like so these presentations more

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.360
or less will be teaching people skills

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.220
they can apply to their own life you can

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.310
do your own introspection you know and

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.690
your own personal stuff can be done on

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.220
your own personal time and then you can

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.410
the teams of four cuz I think it'll be

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.700
good for a zoom window to have four

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.020
people so you can see everyone at once

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.240
in the team of four if you want to if

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.170
you want to have like further

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.450
interaction or further discussion I want

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.310
to break people up into teams of four or

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.890
you can I guess say or you know relate

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.510
to each other and it's pretty loose but

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.480
like how have these skills or how is

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.040
this material how have you applied it to

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.770
your life or if you did or you could

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.000
also be like well I think this is

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.280
[ __ ] you can explain why and just

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.720
kind of go back and forth and like what

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.950
you applied to your life what was the

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.980
result and like what do you think and I

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.210
think again like I said I have a peer

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.680
the group's not really for anyone to

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.630
process personal trauma but it's instead

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.760
to like help teach people process the

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.640
skills to manage that you know Universal

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.320
Universal emotional difficulty

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.790
associated with being a human being and

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.640
we'll get into all that later so this is

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.960
kind of the rule of thumb share the

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.090
things you can share the things only the

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.820
things that you can personally handle

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.560
yourself so if you have this you know if

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.780
one time you got pantsed at summer camp

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.550
and every time you think about it you

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.290
you just go into a blind rage and want

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.570
to cry that's not the stuff of this

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.830
group you know what I mean it's like

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.620
share the things that you can personally

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.940
handle without like your heart beating

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.050
through your chest or like wanting to

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.150
[ __ ] cry wanting to go out and you

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.960
know do heroin whatever like share the

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.810
stuff that you can handle so and again

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.400
and this is important too if you know if

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.480
you're doing these groups I got to throw

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.280
this out there this isn't if you have

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.480
like you know if you've been diagnosed

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.970
with like schizophrenia or like bipolar

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.830
anything serious or if you suspect you

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.510
have some kind of serious underlying

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.780
issue go either email me if you even

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.550
think you might just email me we can

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.290
talk one-on-one and you know I can try

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.180
helps I can use my social work skills to

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.010
set you up with somebody assess your

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.360
situation figure out a way that actually

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.430
like it works for you financially

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.490
timewise everything so again the group's

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.750
I'm gonna be skills-based

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.160
if you're in a group and it's just like

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.110
you know it's just like you're in this

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.610
group and this is something going on the

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.900
group is keeping you up at night or

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.030
making you intensely sad email me you

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.530
and I will handle it the group's not the

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.940
place for that the group's the place for

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.730
again this is what we learned this is

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.470
how I applied it this is what happened

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.940
and you know as the group's get to know

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.320
each other better you guys can feel each

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.640
other out and you know you'll be able to

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.890
see what the group can handle you know

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.890
how deep you guys can go into it but the

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.510
idea is for that to happen gradually you

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.430
don't want people you know coming in

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.980
real hot and being like you know telling

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.300
about stuff the Pappy did you know

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.950
that's [ __ ] up stuff and we all got to

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.900
deal with it and again it's like that's

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.970
not something for you know average Jews

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.590
can handle is it's you know it's [ __ ]

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.780
up so again skills based groups if

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.780
you're getting overtly jacked up from

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.650
the group email me ms secret podcast at

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.830
gmail.com and we'll go through that so

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.180
you know it's like it and that's one

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.110
thing too if you're in the group and

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.220
you're like [ __ ] man this is this is

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.820
just [ __ ] me up

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.070
you may hey guys got to go leave hit me

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.390
up alright well we'll figure that out

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.760
and again I have to stress this is not

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.320
I'm not telling this as a replacement

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.390
for traditional therapy this is just

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.590
something that I would like to do to

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.390
fill the void and I really do think this

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.950
will work and it's nice because if you

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.810
actually apply these skills they have

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.990
been empirically verified and

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.760
demonstrated to make a difference in

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.040
people's lives that lasts so alright so

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.660
that's enough sorry that's probably the

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.320
least fun part of this whole thing yeah

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.680
alright so we're at the text is get out

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.540
of your mind into your life by Steven C

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.570
haze and just a little bit on the theory

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.020
of Act we did talk about it a lot its

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.390
acceptance commitment therapy and it's

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.160
kind of built around what's known as

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.920
psychological flexibility and

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.300
psychological flexibility is like a

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.120
multi-part skillset that and the

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.860
psychological flexibilities we found

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.830
that people who possess psychological

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.500
flexibility are like less likely to have

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.170
you know serious mental disorder less

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.000
likely to develop another serious mental

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
disorder if they already have one and

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.890
often to like are more likely to have

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.660
satisfying relationships less likely a

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.940
divorce on and on non non non it's just

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.610
it's something that this is the stuff I

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.770
talked to with Hayes is like he was

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:27.960
saying they've done they've gone through

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.400
they've done meta-analyses of studies

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.680
where they've taken like hundreds and

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.599
hundreds and thousands of studies of

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:36.789
they specifically study different

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:39.610
modalities of therapy and seeing like

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.159
did it actually work and if all of the

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.810
ones that were clinically significant

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:45.910
they all boiled down to when when you

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.260
stripped all the variables down he said

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.010
all right what are they actually

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.680
teaching people here almost all of them

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.760
boiled down to the psychological

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.500
flexibility so and that's you know

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.150
that's if you think about it that's a

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.400
pretty big [ __ ] deal and this is the

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.440
guy Steven Hayes who came up with the

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.850
theory we'll watch a little bit of his

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.640
thing just to give you a sense of the UH

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.400
the master behind all of this

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:17.250
[Music]

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:23.910
[Applause]

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:29.170
life asks us questions I'm probably one

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.089
of the most important question that asks

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:34.260
us is what are you gonna do about

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:39.220
difficult thoughts and feelings if

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:45.459
you're feeling ashamed or anxious life

00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:49.269
just asks you a question if you're

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:51.160
standing here about to give a TED talk

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.510
and your mind is getting very chattery

00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:00.310
what are you gonna do about that good

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:06.310
question and the answer to that question

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.310
and ones like it say a lot about the

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.350
trajectories of our lives whether or not

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.360
they're gonna unfold in a positive way

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.779
that Mooseport towards prosperity love

00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:20.350
freedom contribution or downward into

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:26.050
pathology and despair and I'm here to

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.990
make the argument that you have within

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.440
you a great answer to that question or

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.230
at least the seed of it but you also

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.519
have this arrogant storytelling

00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:41.440
problem-solving analytic judgemental

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.829
mind between your ears that doesn't have

00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:48.010
the answer and is constantly tempting

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:54.640
you into taking the wrong direction my

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.500
name is Steve

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.860
and for the last last 30 years I and my

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.440
colleagues have been studying a small

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.800
set of psychological processes fancy

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.240
words for things people do called

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.690
psychological flexibility it's a set of

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:17.430
answers to that question and in more

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.790
than a thousand studies we've shown that

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.190
psychological flexibility predicts are

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.390
you going to develop a mental health

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.540
problem anxiety depression trauma if you

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.420
have one predicts later on will you have

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.900
two if it is so severe they are how

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.030
chronic they'll be but not just that it

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.740
predicts all kinds of other things that

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.830
are important to us even though some

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.530
psychopathology such as what kind of

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.740
pair are you gonna be what kind of work

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.990
are you could be can you step up to the

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.760
behavioral challenges of physical

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.890
disease can you stick to your exercise

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:58.250
program everywhere that human minds go

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:03.890
psychological flexibility is relevant

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:09.420
and what I want to do in this talk is to

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.640
walk you through the science of

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.560
psychological flexibility because we've

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.190
learned how to change these processes in

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.880
several hundred studies using acceptance

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.070
and commitment therapy or act and not is

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.350
there related methods to target

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.390
flexibility we've shown that we can

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.010
change it and when we change it those

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.320
life trajectories that are negative go

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.530
positive without right so we get the

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.470
idea the yeah if you didn't watch this

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.270
TED talk it's pretty cool I would

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.920
suggest you watch that entire one here's

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.150
a bunch of them but that one's really

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.530
good he goes into his own personal

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.010
history alright and again act as I said

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.330
is based off and he kind of hinted at

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.820
that in the talk about how we have think

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.140
he says something like our brains are

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.180
designed for these problem-solving

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.640
machines that only human beings are

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.380
capable they solve problems in ways that

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.730
only human beings are capable of doing

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.970
but it also leads to a suffering in ways

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.550
that no other animal suffers so

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.860
yeah so okay this is someone who's

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.470
explaining rft it gets super weird and

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.360
complicated as you can see is a picture

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.950
it's like what is a bar you know

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.310
whatever but again it's it's really like

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.770
the this research in theory suggests

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.390
that many of the tools we use to solve

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.130
problems lead us to traps that create

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.590
human suffering so and this is a quote

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.240
from his book to put it bluntly human

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.740
beings are playing a rigged game in

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.870
which the human mind itself a wonderful

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.060
tool for mastering the environment has

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.060
turned on its host which again might be

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.760
unclear but um you know hold on to your

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.170
hot dog dude because well we'll we

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.790
actually do a really deep dive into that

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.410
in Chapter two this is just the

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.000
introduction of the book so this is like

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.190
I'm giving people a double introduction

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.620
the one guy gave us an introduction this

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.140
is now a more in-depth introduction so

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.420
we cover the groups you got a little

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.970
understanding of the theory now for the

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.380
text all right

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.050
and again this book is called get out of

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.910
your mind and into your life by Steven C

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.910
Hayes there's the beast himself talk to

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.640
him on zoom' for two hours I and also to

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.590
act therapy acceptance and commitment

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.300
therapy is according to Steven Hayes

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.570
it's quickly becoming the therapy of

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:23.080
choice for psychedelic interventions so

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.760
I thought that was pretty cool and as

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.260
you get into it you kind of see it makes

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.650
sense but hold on one second here all

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.040
right sorry about that

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.500
my wife's friend was returning jumper

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.370
cables which hey man you know no big

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.770
deal first time you know well it's just

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.810
its second time I mean first time you

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.060
borrow jumper cables you know [ __ ]

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:46.570
happens

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.880
second time it's like all right go to

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.330
the [ __ ] hardware store not mad not

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.090
pissed at all no I'm not actually

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.920
it was nice seeing her all right so

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.190
where was I all right so act acceptance

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.830
commitment their therapy the way I think

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.150
of it I think of it's like a it's kind

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:07.450
of a futuristic Buddhism because it's

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.190
very similar to Buddhism with like the

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.260
you know the universal truths and own

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.810
Four Noble Truths whatever they are they

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:18.510
really kind of rail on this idea that

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.070
pain and suffering are a universal enix

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.010
capable truth of life so which is funny

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:25.480
because it's like you know this is like

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.540
oh and a lot of the psychological

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.240
interventions a lot of them do kind of

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.300
regurgitate this like Eastern philosophy

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.890
stuff but I mean for good reason I think

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:40.780
a lot of it's true but the cool the way

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.040
the way I think the reason I think it's

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.600
kind of like a futuristic Buddhism is

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.390
they like Buddhism I I've read a little

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.770
bit about it and I usually just kind of

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.150
get bored after a while because it's

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.280
like feeling is there's like a lot of

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.630
riddles and [ __ ] and you read it and

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:53.920
it's just like oh you know what dude I

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.020
don't [ __ ] know it's like what noise

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.730
does a one-armed man make when he

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.470
collapsed it's like I don't want to

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.970
think about that but either way so this

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.910
is um this is very much kind of like to

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.550
the point and again it's like they they

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.430
really do back up their claims so none

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.170
of this is kind of like just people be

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.790
like you know what I think school it's

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.750
like they do it they study it it works

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.020
awesome alright so act what is act act

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.910
is getting out of your fantasy driven

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.220
simulation so and again by the when I

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.560
say simulation I mean your tendency for

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.450
your mind to daydream which according to

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.090
Harvard researchers we spend about 50%

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.000
of our waking day and like a half day

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.260
dream state where we're not I mean

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.400
honestly it could be more for more

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.340
people we're we're not in the present

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.990
moment or thinking about exactly what

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.910
we're doing but instead we're either

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.590
like dwelling on the past worrying about

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.290
the future or just kind of like not even

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.730
there's like thinking about our moms

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.290
being like what the [ __ ] is her deal

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.450
like you know so it's like we spend most

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.780
of our time in this kind of like

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.570
personal fantasy realm that is different

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:57.050
for everybody

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.730
you know some people you know they they

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.410
check out of work and daydream and they

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.270
start thinking about like their car

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.770
running off of a bridge so it can be

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.280
anything so the idea of act is to get

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.720
out of the simulation that is running

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.100
through your head and into your actual

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.280
present moment operating on your values

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.780
this is the goal right this is Longview

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.120
you're operating via your values rather

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.220
than your pitiful futile attempts at

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.500
avoiding pain through seeking control it

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.720
says or avoidance but it's seeking

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.480
control and avoidance so again I want to

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.620
know I'm gonna hammer that home this is

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.640
like the this is very important because

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.530
most of us are operating without even

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.940
realizing it of just trying to avoid

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.770
painful situations painful thoughts

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.540
painful feelings and the way we do that

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.250
typically are things that in the long

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.950
term caused us more pain and suffering

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.420
again this is just the intro I'll get

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.830
into all that and back all that stuff up

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.290
later so again we want to operate via

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.260
our personal values that we decide which

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.940
again most of us probably don't even

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.400
have that you know what is out here like

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.440
a [ __ ] just dogs just looking at [ __ ]

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.780
and reacting so the idea is to get out

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.650
of dog brain hilarious and get into more

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.260
of like you know thinking about defining

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.120
ourselves what's important to us acting

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.310
through that rather than just like I was

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.630
talking to spud today it's like you know

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.790
you go in the grocery store it's like

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.130
you know you walk in your school oh this

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.990
is sweet this tastes good but it's like

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.340
if you're filtering those decisions

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.530
through your values it's like well you

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.060
know I mean you could say you know what

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.570
dude I value eating dunkaroos is like

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:29.830
you'll get them but if you're like you

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.019
know say you're somebody's wife

00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:33.429
somebody's girlfriend you're just a dude

00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:34.690
who's trying to be hot it's like you

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.820
know the old trap where it's like eating

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.590
a bunch of sugary [ __ ] and then

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.960
being like I feel so fat in this it's

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.980
like we'll stop eating all the sugary

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.179
[ __ ] [ __ ] your actions don't

00:18:43.179 --> 00:18:44.470
align with your values goddamn it

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.759
it's all right I'm not gonna get into

00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:48.070
into that so look we're still in the

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.740
intro and again we're still in his book

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.840
so I'm kind of in you'll see I sometimes

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.330
I quote him directly but I'll if you

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.529
ever hear anything in this book that

00:18:56.529 --> 00:18:58.330
sounds like remotely interesting and

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:58.960
insightful

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.789
just credited to Steven Hades it's

00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:04.000
probably his idea all all of this is his

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.950
we're living in Steven Hayes his idea

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.049
right now but again so it's like I'm on

00:19:08.049 --> 00:19:09.190
I don't want to get into like

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.570
plagiarizing stuff I'm not plagiarizing

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.129
anything anything you think is cool just

00:19:12.129 --> 00:19:14.200
attribute it to Hayes all right all

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.659
right so this is his first analogy to

00:19:16.659 --> 00:19:18.220
try to explain how to get out of this

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.289
simulation but you know I'm pretty sure

00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:22.559
I came up with simulation but what I'm

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:25.029
we're all scientists here all like you

00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:26.259
know groundbreaking theorists no big

00:19:26.259 --> 00:19:28.330
deal so the first thing he came up with

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:29.889
this is the idea of fighting the war in

00:19:29.889 --> 00:19:32.080
terms of like you know our attempts to

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.259
try to avoid pain and what he's trying

00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:37.629
to get us to do is leave the war you

00:19:37.629 --> 00:19:38.950
know it's like think of the you know

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.720
remember that Japanese soldier who

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.490
stayed hidden for like thirty years

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.379
after World War two he was in the jungle

00:19:44.379 --> 00:19:46.059
fighting a war that didn't even exist

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:47.799
you didn't know what ended he was as

00:19:47.799 --> 00:19:49.659
their bayonetting [ __ ] and

00:19:49.659 --> 00:19:52.720
shooting people and running away all for

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.669
nothing the war was over and this guy

00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:56.200
was in the woods like a [ __ ] nutcase

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.179
just fighting this battle that didn't

00:19:58.179 --> 00:20:00.070
need to be fought alright and this is a

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.720
direct this is how Hayes explains it

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.240
this is a direct quote metaphorically

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.070
the distinction between the function of

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.289
a psychological disorder and the form it

00:20:08.289 --> 00:20:10.299
takes in one's life can be likened to

00:20:10.299 --> 00:20:11.620
someone standing in a battlefield

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.320
fighting a war the war is not going well

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.659
meaning our attempts to mitigate our

00:20:16.659 --> 00:20:18.700
pain and suffering I decided that the

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.100
person fights harder and harder losing

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.289
is a devastating option but unless the

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:25.750
war is won the person fighting thinks

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.669
that living a worthwhile life will be

00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:30.159
impossible that's important this idea

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:32.559
like if I could just do this then

00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:36.370
everything would be okay not so much so

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.649
anyway so the war goes on

00:20:38.649 --> 00:20:40.899
unknown to that person however is the

00:20:40.899 --> 00:20:41.710
fact that at

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.659
anytime he or she can quit the

00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:45.490
battlefield and begin to live life now

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.370
the war may still go on but the outcome

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.140
of the war is no longer very important

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.390
and the seemingly logical sequence of

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.010
having to win the war before beginning

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.200
to live life has been abandoned the war

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.970
looks and sounds much the same this is

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.520
you know I cut some stuff out in

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.860
paraphrased so it's like after we leave

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.830
the war that's the dot the war looks and

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.630
sounds much the same whether you're

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.220
fighting in it or simply watching it its

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.440
appearance stays the same but its impact

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.630
its actual substance it's profoundly

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.610
different fighting for your life it's

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.830
not the same as living your life so it's

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.390
like again the Japanese soldier

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.039
this guy's hidden in the woods fighting

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:24.250
a war we're like what was the impact of

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.020
World War 2 on that guy's life after

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.520
that he could have his [ __ ] left but

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.049
he just stayed in the woods can't

00:21:29.049 --> 00:21:31.029
believe it in World War 2 spent 30 years

00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:35.529
dude hidden in the woods you know shit's

00:21:35.529 --> 00:21:38.860
[ __ ] up alright so here's another

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.450
analogy so you know the war ones cool

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.490
you know whatever think of it this way

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.200
right the war one you like a dude you

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.520
I'm not fighting a war [ __ ] you alright

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.169
well here's another analogy because

00:21:47.169 --> 00:21:48.549
Stephen Hayes is you know this [ __ ]

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:50.440
smart all right so now [ __ ] the war

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.940
you'd even fight the word too cool for

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.350
the wall right you're like you went to

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.059
[ __ ] Canada drafted it all together

00:21:55.059 --> 00:21:57.640
you [ __ ] [ __ ] alright so now you're

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.870
walking in the woods when all of a

00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:59.980
sudden you see someone stuck in

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:00.520
quicksand

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.710
there's no branches or ropes around all

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.630
you can do is say something useful to

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.659
them what do you do option one [ __ ]

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:09.640
jump in and save them option two tell

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.840
them to chill as hard as they can

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.700
let's just select option one and see

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.950
what happens all right now we're both

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.899
dead and they get another quote from the

00:22:16.899 --> 00:22:18.760
book when people step into something

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.320
they want to get out of be it a briar

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.230
patch or mud ninety-nine percent of the

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.600
time the effective action is to run step

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.600
hop or jump out of trouble though when

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.970
dealing with quicksand that same thing

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.279
that helps almost every other time as a

00:22:33.279 --> 00:22:35.740
really bad idea again that's a really

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.210
important thing when dealing with his

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.830
idea of relational frame theory how

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.390
language puts us in a unique position

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.669
that helps us so many other times but

00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:45.520
like in the idea of trying to manage our

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.429
mental states [ __ ] us so I'll repeat

00:22:48.429 --> 00:22:49.809
that though when dealing with quicksand

00:22:49.809 --> 00:22:51.940
that same thing that helps almost every

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.070
other time meaning like the the instinct

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.210
to jump or move

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.789
do something is a really bad idea once

00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:59.980
one foot is lifted all of the trap

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.110
persons weight rests on only half the

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.750
surface area formula occupied this means

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.700
downward pressure instantly doubles in

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.770
addition the suction of the quicksand

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.750
around the foot being lifted provides

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.149
even more downward pressure on the other

00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:14.919
already sinking foot so you're in

00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:17.049
quicksand and you thrash you just think

00:23:17.049 --> 00:23:18.429
more and more and more we all know this

00:23:18.429 --> 00:23:21.159
this is why people die in quick-set but

00:23:21.159 --> 00:23:22.630
yeah I actually didn't know this about

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.000
quicksand so you tell them to chill as

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.929
hard as possible

00:23:25.929 --> 00:23:28.440
okay so yeah you see the picture the guy

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.779
rolled out of mud so if you understand

00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:33.309
how quicksand works again this is a

00:23:33.309 --> 00:23:35.260
quote you would yell at the person to

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.240
stop struggling and try to lay flat

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.669
spread-eagle to maximize contact with

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.679
the surface of the pool in that position

00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:43.299
that probably the person probably

00:23:43.299 --> 00:23:45.100
wouldn't sink and might be able to log

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.230
roll to safety since the person is

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.090
trying to get out of the quicksand is it

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.799
is extremely counterintuitive to

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:53.740
maximize body contact with it somebody's

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.260
struggling to get out of the mud may

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.450
never realize that it is wiser and safer

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.830
to get with the mud I [ __ ] love that

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.120
and he it is it's one of those things

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.500
it's like that's why quicksand kills us

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.720
because it's you know spiders have webs

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.539
and you know lions have big teeth

00:24:09.539 --> 00:24:14.770
quicksand just by its what it is just

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.779
[ __ ] this up because it's like oh [ __ ]

00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:18.549
we're stuck I know what to do it and we

00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:21.270
do our animal instinct let me out and it

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:23.590
we sink ourselves in it that's why

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.649
quicksand [ __ ] us up and it you

00:24:26.649 --> 00:24:27.640
wouldn't think of it when you lay in

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.289
quicksand you doesn't you try to touch

00:24:29.289 --> 00:24:30.730
and get as much of that [ __ ] on you as

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.399
you can you lay flat just oh just lay

00:24:33.399 --> 00:24:35.830
get with the mud and then once you

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.690
accept the fact that you're a quicksand

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:42.190
hint you're able to pivot log-roll to

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.789
safety

00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:45.760
alright I'm dropping breadcrumbs better

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.890
be picking them up alright so we covered

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.630
the quicksand alright so it is suffering

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.429
truly universal you know you're anything

00:24:54.429 --> 00:24:58.499
I'm chilling I doubt it yes

00:24:58.499 --> 00:25:00.970
hey says we don't assume that left to

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.679
their own devices normal human beings

00:25:02.679 --> 00:25:04.659
are happy and that only an odd history

00:25:04.659 --> 00:25:06.610
or a broken biology disturbs the peace

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.889
we assume instead that suffering is

00:25:08.889 --> 00:25:11.559
normal and it is the unusual person who

00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:13.749
learns how to create peace of mind and

00:25:13.749 --> 00:25:15.399
this was cool too and I talked to him he

00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:17.950
was saying like there's so many stats in

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.320
psychology of like you know 1 out of 5

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.519
people have a major psychological

00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:24.399
disorder and you know or suffer

00:25:24.399 --> 00:25:25.990
psychologically whatever you know they

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.519
try to quantify like there's official

00:25:27.519 --> 00:25:28.960
psychological suffering then there's

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.909
just like you know everybody else eating

00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:33.460
[ __ ] all the time and what hey said he

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.320
goes dude it's not 1 out of 5 it's not 2

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.779
out of 5 it's 5 out of 5 we're all

00:25:37.779 --> 00:25:40.809
[ __ ] up and again the reason why is

00:25:40.809 --> 00:25:45.429
our unique ability to make connections

00:25:45.429 --> 00:25:46.960
through language that no other animal

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.580
can so we're in a unique position to

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.399
suffer harder than any other animal so

00:25:51.399 --> 00:25:53.080
just again keep that in mind we'll get

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.090
to it it's only be intro I'm kind of

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.779
blowing my load excuse me alright and

00:25:58.779 --> 00:25:59.860
here's some super depressing statistics

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.330
in case you were like you know what now

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:02.679
human beings aren't suffering it's not

00:26:02.679 --> 00:26:04.830
universal alright we'll consider this

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.879
throughout your lifetime you have about

00:26:06.879 --> 00:26:08.440
a 50/50 chance of struggling with

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.360
suicidal thoughts at a moderate severe

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.490
level for at least two weeks that's the

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.159
study done by chilies and strosahl also

00:26:15.159 --> 00:26:17.499
out of the book almost 100% of the

00:26:17.499 --> 00:26:19.179
people on this planet will at some point

00:26:19.179 --> 00:26:20.740
in their life contemplate killing

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.080
themselves for sure every time I Drive

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.299
pre verbal children do not make suicide

00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:28.330
attempts but even very young newly

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.580
verbal it's in bold font if you're not

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.690
listening if you're just listening to

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.360
this pay attention newly verbal children

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.369
occasionally do make suicide attempts

00:26:36.369 --> 00:26:37.809
hmm one of those are connection between

00:26:37.809 --> 00:26:40.240
language and things that would make us

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.070
want to kill ourselves well that was

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.950
cool I mean you know sucks that kids are

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:45.940
trying to kill themselves but that's

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.669
crazy dude to think about that the fact

00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:50.950
that as soon as language kicks in people

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:53.320
are like oh [ __ ] this you know what is

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.200
that we'll find out alright super

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.289
depressing stats number two about 30

00:26:59.289 --> 00:27:02.259
percent of all adults will have a major

00:27:02.259 --> 00:27:04.240
psychiatric disorder at any given point

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.860
in time and about 50 percent will have

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.869
such a disorder at some point in their

00:27:07.869 --> 00:27:10.299
lives and nearly 80% of these will have

00:27:10.299 --> 00:27:12.190
more than one serious psychological

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:14.830
a problem so 30% of all adults will have

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.230
a major psychiatric disorder and then

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.260
50% will have you know at any given

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.140
point in time like right now and then

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.690
50% of us will have had such a disorder

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.250
at some point in our lives extreme

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.680
anxiety extreme depression you know on

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.750
and on and on just meant whatever and

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:34.330
nearly 80% of the people who have had

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.120
some form of extreme psychological

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.700
disturbance will have another at some

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.440
point in life so you're you're you know

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.660
it's it's 50/50 shot dude you've all

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.270
thought about killing ourselves and then

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.770
there's a 50% shot that we're suffering

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:49.450
from at some point I have a serious

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:50.830
psychological disorder and the thing

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.720
that has been found scientifically to

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.180
get us to have log-roll us to safety out

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.890
of our psychological disorders happens

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.930
to be psychological flexibility so I'm

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.970
people innately have it but it can also

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.830
be learned which is you know the point

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:06.480
of this all right more depressing news

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.810
excuse me

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.760
any depressants are a ten billion dollar

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.800
industry even though their average

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.110
impact on depression is only 20% better

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.960
than placebo too small to be clinically

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.990
significant meanwhile our consumption of

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.670
antidepressants is so high that our

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.380
rivers and streams have become polluted

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.030
with them contaminating the fish that we

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.010
eat and again I do want to say that

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.860
there's um you know that's not to say

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.060
like if you're on Danny the presents

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.130
right now stop because that's not the

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.340
case there are people who like have bio

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.590
have something that's misfiring

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.510
biologically that you know they need

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.460
that chemical boost the problem is is

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.920
that people don't go through the other

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.510
steps of like you know like how are you

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.160
sleeping how are you dieting what are

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.900
your relationships like what are your

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.550
regular thought patterns which kick in

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:53.260
right like there's so many other things

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.970
you should check off before you go to a

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:56.500
chemical solution and it just doesn't

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.390
happen and so the problems not like if

00:28:58.390 --> 00:28:59.500
you're not if you're on them this isn't

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.970
like you [ __ ] faker you stop

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.350
doing that [ __ ] and you know do push-ups

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:04.060
that doesn't work for you know there's

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.410
there's people who that truly truly

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.180
doesn't work for they can optimize every

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.590
aspect of their life and they'll still

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.460
have some sort of um you know

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.240
biochemical disturbance in their brain

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.220
so again don't take that as like oh [ __ ]

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.320
you know I'm gonna stop don't stop

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.330
always talk to your doctor with any kind

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.370
of medication talk to a doctor you know

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.140
you can still do all these exercises but

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.659
don't like you

00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:26.340
don't just throw them all down the

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.249
[ __ ] you know sink cuz I said so but

00:29:29.249 --> 00:29:32.970
again the problem is not them themselves

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.609
it's the widespread go to use of them

00:29:35.609 --> 00:29:37.409
that's kind of the problem here and

00:29:37.409 --> 00:29:40.049
again as they say it's like it's not we

00:29:40.049 --> 00:29:41.879
the the planet can't handle how many

00:29:41.879 --> 00:29:43.379
people are taking these you know there's

00:29:43.379 --> 00:29:45.269
streams and suffer becoming literally

00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:46.590
polluted where you eat fish and it's

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.629
like it has Zoloft in it that's a

00:29:48.629 --> 00:29:50.820
problem and again it's it sucks for the

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.769
people who like truly truly truly need

00:29:52.769 --> 00:29:54.330
them and then he get people who are like

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.309
I'm kind of bummed out let me pop these

00:29:56.309 --> 00:29:58.409
and it's like you should try something

00:29:58.409 --> 00:29:59.820
else first that's all I'm saying

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.149
so again hopefully that's clear okay

00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:05.759
more depressing news only half of those

00:30:05.759 --> 00:30:08.070
who's only half of those who seek only

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:11.549
half of those who seek help typo okay so

00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:12.869
only half of those who seek help are

00:30:12.869 --> 00:30:14.340
diagnosed by the way I have to do this

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.570
all in one take I don't have anything

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.259
software so I do it on zoom one take kid

00:30:18.259 --> 00:30:20.309
so half of those who seek help or

00:30:20.309 --> 00:30:21.720
diagnosed with a serious mental health

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.399
disorder the other half are simply

00:30:23.399 --> 00:30:25.109
having problems at work in their

00:30:25.109 --> 00:30:27.509
marriage with family or simply from a

00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:29.179
lack of purpose or meaning in their life

00:30:29.179 --> 00:30:31.889
so out of all the people who seek help

00:30:31.889 --> 00:30:34.639
fifty percent have a verifiable you know

00:30:34.639 --> 00:30:36.899
psychological health a mental disorder

00:30:36.899 --> 00:30:38.429
which again you can you know people get

00:30:38.429 --> 00:30:39.809
all into that if like who gets to say

00:30:39.809 --> 00:30:41.549
what that is and who has I'm not you

00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:43.979
know in it sometimes it's like if you

00:30:43.979 --> 00:30:44.909
have bipolar

00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:47.099
you know let's say bipolar type two

00:30:47.099 --> 00:30:49.710
something like you know where you have a

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.979
manic state four seven I think it's five

00:30:52.979 --> 00:30:54.479
days oh I had one for four well you

00:30:54.479 --> 00:30:56.970
don't have you know bipolar type two

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.889
it's like really buy one day it's the

00:30:58.889 --> 00:31:00.809
same [ __ ] thing but you know so not to

00:31:00.809 --> 00:31:02.129
get too off into that this is only a

00:31:02.129 --> 00:31:04.409
[ __ ] intro but again you get the idea

00:31:04.409 --> 00:31:06.809
it's like there's people having like

00:31:06.809 --> 00:31:08.759
diagnoseable problems but there's also a

00:31:08.759 --> 00:31:11.070
huge chunk of people who are just their

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:12.599
relationships aren't working this things

00:31:12.599 --> 00:31:13.859
are just [ __ ] up they can't figure out

00:31:13.859 --> 00:31:16.169
what to do with themselves you know or

00:31:16.169 --> 00:31:17.460
any depresses the best thing to figure

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.690
out what to do with your life I don't

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.999
[ __ ] know alright more super

00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:23.669
depressing stats the final one 50% of

00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:25.289
marriages end in divorce and the rate of

00:31:25.289 --> 00:31:28.169
remarriage are no better and the dismal

00:31:28.169 --> 00:31:30.330
stats on fidelity abuse and marital

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.919
unhappiness show that many intact

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:33.389
marriages are based on unhealthy

00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:35.940
relationships and again just to really

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.499
rub your nose and how shitty everything

00:31:37.499 --> 00:31:38.349
is

00:31:38.349 --> 00:31:40.419
people who live in countries with

00:31:40.419 --> 00:31:42.859
spectacularly successful economies do

00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:44.299
not have fewer social or interpersonal

00:31:44.299 --> 00:31:45.379
problems

00:31:45.379 --> 00:31:48.440
eg suicide than their counterparts and

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.779
more difficult economic circumstances so

00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:52.580
again you know that from living in

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.889
America or wherever you live you know

00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:56.779
it's like you think we wouldn't be all

00:31:56.779 --> 00:31:59.450
bummed out but we are why I don't

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:02.359
[ __ ] know alright so now we're bummed

00:32:02.359 --> 00:32:03.950
out what's the [ __ ] plan dude

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:07.249
let's see alright so keep these

00:32:07.249 --> 00:32:08.959
questions in mind why is human suffering

00:32:08.959 --> 00:32:10.969
so pervasive why is you're so hard to

00:32:10.969 --> 00:32:13.099
change and what can be done about it

00:32:13.099 --> 00:32:17.409
here are the three pillars of act

00:32:17.409 --> 00:32:19.669
acceptance and commitment therapy you

00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:21.200
have mindfulness acceptance and

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.820
commitment so we'll start with

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.899
mindfulness all right so mindfulness

00:32:26.899 --> 00:32:30.229
what is it to be mindful I recently had

00:32:30.229 --> 00:32:32.959
a quote here I'll grab it in a second

00:32:32.959 --> 00:32:34.789
so for mindfulness think of your

00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:36.559
thoughts like lenses that you view the

00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:38.959
world from we have a tendency to cling

00:32:38.959 --> 00:32:40.909
to our particular lens and allow it to

00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:43.129
dictate how we interpret our experiences

00:32:43.129 --> 00:32:45.429
even to the point of infirm forming us

00:32:45.429 --> 00:32:48.289
who we think we are so we have a thought

00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:51.169
we cling or they say in this you fuse to

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:53.299
that thought all right so it's like man

00:32:53.299 --> 00:32:54.320
I'm a [ __ ] loser

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.940
you know like well you know what

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.249
happened oh somebody has some girl on a

00:32:58.249 --> 00:33:00.049
date she said no well maybe she has a

00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:01.579
[ __ ] boyfriend but you know you don't

00:33:01.579 --> 00:33:02.959
go into that you're not psychologically

00:33:02.959 --> 00:33:04.820
flexible you go no I'm a loser oh you

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.989
have the thought I'm a loser you don't

00:33:05.989 --> 00:33:07.579
question the thought you immediately

00:33:07.579 --> 00:33:09.829
fuse to it now it dictates your identity

00:33:09.829 --> 00:33:11.629
and you say well I guess I'm just a

00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:13.489
loser because I made it up in my head

00:33:13.489 --> 00:33:17.719
that I'm a loser alright sorry

00:33:17.719 --> 00:33:19.879
damn I do this like Jones do this is

00:33:19.879 --> 00:33:22.249
live this is [ __ ] sick and the quote

00:33:22.249 --> 00:33:23.659
goes on maybe you're stuck in the lens

00:33:23.659 --> 00:33:25.669
of psychological pain you may say things

00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:27.679
yourself like I'm depressed and then

00:33:27.679 --> 00:33:29.149
fuse with that thought to the point

00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:30.769
where it becomes integrated into your

00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:33.289
identity like I just said though as you

00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:35.029
free yourself from the illusions of

00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:38.089
language you will become of many weight

00:33:38.089 --> 00:33:40.099
okay as you free yourself from the

00:33:40.099 --> 00:33:41.419
illusions of language you will become

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:43.369
aware of many other verbal lenses that

00:33:43.369 --> 00:33:46.399
pop up everyday and yet will not be

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:49.309
defined by them mindfulness allows us to

00:33:49.309 --> 00:33:51.770
undermine these cognitive lenses

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.840
so that we can look at our pain rather

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.210
than seeing the world through it that's

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.970
important again I'm a loser I'm

00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:59.750
depressed

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.510
this [ __ ] stalks gonna go horrible

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.540
I'm gonna fail this test that's just a

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:06.890
thought that pop that's that's a window

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.899
dude as a pop Abed you know imagine if

00:34:08.899 --> 00:34:10.250
every pop up bad you're like oh [ __ ] I

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:13.340
got it what is this I want a vacation I

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.899
got it that's what it is when you fuse

00:34:14.899 --> 00:34:16.159
with your thoughts this is just popping

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:19.610
up so you can being mindful I think in

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:20.810
this this book I think has the best

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:25.669
description of what being mindful is let

00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:27.260
me say I'm gonna I'm gonna go to this

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.550
and find it just because it's so good

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.360
all right here we go

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.970
this I think you know then again the

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:33.380
illusions of language are important but

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.179
this is a point that I got from Rollo

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:38.090
Mays courage to create and this is again

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.710
I think the point of being mindful it

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.690
says human freedom involves our capacity

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:43.250
to pause between stimulus and response

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.649
stimulus meaning the thought that I'm a

00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:47.990
loser and response the action we're

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:49.520
going to take because we think we're a

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.190
loser and in that pause it's okay so

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.200
human freedom involves our capacity to

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.909
pause between stimulus and response and

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:58.700
and that pause to choose one response

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.190
toward which we wish to throw our weight

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:03.500
the capacity to create ourselves based

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.690
upon this freedom is inseparable from

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:07.700
consciousness or self-awareness meaning

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.970
we have a thought being mindful allows

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.610
us to be stimulated by again so when a

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:15.620
[ __ ] loser you know [ __ ] you you know

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.230
in road rage scenarios some guy gives us

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.120
the finger do we flip the [ __ ] out and

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.620
get out of our car and try to start

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.020
fighting that guy or do we just observe

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.940
that and say like what the [ __ ] that

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.160
guy's problem and then just go where

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.540
we're going instead of you know getting

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.490
some sort of assault charge or getting

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:32.930
our [ __ ] ass kicked on the highway

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.090
because that would suck - so again

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:37.570
mindfulness not fusing with our thoughts

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.440
creating through again through

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.090
mindfulness practice because this does

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:44.450
take practice pushing some space giving

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:46.220
ourselves the the you know the Keanu

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:46.810
Reaves

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.670
matrix slowdown where you know our bays

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:51.230
in her face and she's like need second

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.570
yeah and you're just like just a [ __ ]

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.310
or you just wash your bed you like me oh

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:58.790
you're just like just dodging all of her

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.890
[ __ ] you're in a way better position

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:01.910
to deal with it again that takes

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:04.400
mindfulness that's one point of a

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.809
psychological flexibility

00:36:05.809 --> 00:36:08.180
so again mindfulness allows us to

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.949
undermine these cognitive lenses our our

00:36:09.949 --> 00:36:11.959
thoughts so that we can look at our pain

00:36:11.959 --> 00:36:13.430
rather than seeing the world through it

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:15.739
when we do this we start to notice there

00:36:15.739 --> 00:36:17.420
are bigger better things we can be doing

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.640
with the present moment than trying to

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.069
regulate its psychological content aka

00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:26.359
the simulation again sounds kind of

00:36:26.359 --> 00:36:28.009
complicated but there's better things we

00:36:28.009 --> 00:36:30.319
can be doing with our time meaning the

00:36:30.319 --> 00:36:32.569
present moment than trying to regulate

00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:35.959
our thoughts against threats that could

00:36:35.959 --> 00:36:38.989
very well and most likely aren't real

00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:41.900
we're just bugging the [ __ ] out all

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.420
right now we're at acceptance acceptance

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.670
right so when we encounter painful

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:48.319
content within ourselves we try to fix

00:36:48.319 --> 00:36:50.180
it that's that's that's hopping out of

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.589
the quicksand we're you know we're in

00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:52.939
and Ludd we're in the briar patch what

00:36:52.939 --> 00:36:55.069
do we do we figure out how to get out of

00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:58.249
it but again our internal lives are not

00:36:58.249 --> 00:36:59.569
at all like the physical world or

00:36:59.569 --> 00:37:00.589
internal lives are kind of like

00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:03.140
quicksand we live in history and time

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.660
and we live in history excuse me and

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.289
time only moves in one direction not two

00:37:08.289 --> 00:37:10.519
you know it's only going forward you

00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:12.019
can't go back we can't do anything about

00:37:12.019 --> 00:37:14.089
anything that's ever happened you know

00:37:14.089 --> 00:37:15.140
we can do well on it but that doesn't

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.880
help us

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.859
so psychological pain also has a history

00:37:18.859 --> 00:37:21.319
and it's not a matter of getting rid of

00:37:21.319 --> 00:37:23.569
it again which is impossible unless you

00:37:23.569 --> 00:37:25.549
have the MIB flash stick so the only

00:37:25.549 --> 00:37:27.199
thing we can do is learn how to deal

00:37:27.199 --> 00:37:29.509
with it and move forward because if

00:37:29.509 --> 00:37:31.160
we're it's like you're it's like when

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.539
you're running late to something you're

00:37:32.539 --> 00:37:33.859
I don't know if you even run late to

00:37:33.859 --> 00:37:35.839
like you know school or a meeting and

00:37:35.839 --> 00:37:37.640
it's like you know you're you can only

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.349
go so fast you're limited by the cars

00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:40.759
around you but you have that internal

00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:43.369
like like you're trying to [ __ ] you

00:37:43.369 --> 00:37:44.959
want everything to speed up around you

00:37:44.959 --> 00:37:46.309
and you're just you're trying to like

00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:48.709
move mattr or you just have to accept

00:37:48.709 --> 00:37:50.029
the fact you're [ __ ] late you know

00:37:50.029 --> 00:37:51.979
you're already late why give yourself a

00:37:51.979 --> 00:37:53.299
heart attack about it you're gonna be

00:37:53.299 --> 00:37:54.499
late you're gonna walk in five minutes

00:37:54.499 --> 00:37:56.059
late maybe everyone starts like you

00:37:56.059 --> 00:37:57.349
don't know what's going on you know

00:37:57.349 --> 00:38:00.589
it's like you just have to accept the

00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:01.339
fact that you're late

00:38:01.339 --> 00:38:03.079
oh you're [ __ ] up about the past and

00:38:03.079 --> 00:38:04.670
it's so much easier said than done again

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:07.339
this does take a lot of work but trying

00:38:07.339 --> 00:38:08.749
to fight against it trying to control it

00:38:08.749 --> 00:38:11.029
trying to you know go over it again all

00:38:11.029 --> 00:38:12.499
what if I only said it just [ __ ]

00:38:12.499 --> 00:38:15.410
accept it move on that's acceptance just

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:16.999
saying alright my life is only moving

00:38:16.999 --> 00:38:18.670
forward from the present

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.680
right here right now that's the only

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.329
thing I can control that's the only

00:38:22.329 --> 00:38:24.069
thing I can deal with except the past

00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:25.630
except the fact the future probably

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:27.160
holds a bunch of crazy [ __ ] that's

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.200
gonna [ __ ] us up and just move on

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.900
alright so the acceptance and Act is

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.700
based on this notion that as a rule

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.680
trying to get rid of your pain only

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.109
amplifies it entangles you further in it

00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:39.700
and transforms it into something

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.069
traumatic meanwhile living your life

00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:43.869
your actual goals and things you find

00:38:43.869 --> 00:38:45.999
meaningful is pushed to the side again

00:38:45.999 --> 00:38:48.239
think about the quicksand and the war

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:50.829
and again I have to always reiterate

00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:53.799
this is all from this book this is not

00:38:53.799 --> 00:38:56.230
just accepting defeat - this is more of

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.329
an active acceptance of the moment and

00:38:58.329 --> 00:39:00.099
it might sound weird but it's something

00:39:00.099 --> 00:39:01.359
that can only be learned through

00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:03.339
personal practice so feel free to stay

00:39:03.339 --> 00:39:05.289
skeptical but we'll cover more on this

00:39:05.289 --> 00:39:06.940
later on in the book that's from the man

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.799
haze himself so again if it still sound

00:39:08.799 --> 00:39:10.299
weird it's like yeah it is [ __ ] weird

00:39:10.299 --> 00:39:12.640
because we for some reason in school are

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.650
taught to multiply and learn the state

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:16.059
capitals and they smack you in the ass

00:39:16.059 --> 00:39:17.200
and I get out there and you're just

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.599
we're all just [ __ ] mental wrecks

00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:21.309
okay why is the [ __ ] rivers polluted

00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:22.989
with antidepressants because no one ever

00:39:22.989 --> 00:39:24.220
[ __ ] told us how to handle our brains

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.829
that's what we're doing right now all

00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:27.130
right

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.150
this is commitment this is the

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.799
commitment part commitment and you know

00:39:29.799 --> 00:39:32.380
the values based living Sikh values

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.329
based I'm such a [ __ ] dork I put that

00:39:34.329 --> 00:39:35.380
in the presentation I thought that'd be

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.499
funny it's not [ __ ] 20 values-based

00:39:38.499 --> 00:39:41.950
all right so the commitment and

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:45.039
value-based Living is committing it once

00:39:45.039 --> 00:39:47.319
you you know once so you know ideally in

00:39:47.319 --> 00:39:48.970
the acceptance and commitment therapy

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.940
world you know once you accept what's

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.150
going on and once you kind of accept

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.769
what's going on accept the fact that you

00:39:56.769 --> 00:39:59.259
know pain is universal you can't control

00:39:59.259 --> 00:40:01.180
it the only thing you can do is identify

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.890
your values and move forward in that

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:03.489
direction

00:40:03.489 --> 00:40:05.650
so this is what the author asks how much

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.480
of your time do you spend focused on

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.489
what is most meaningful to you do you

00:40:09.489 --> 00:40:11.200
even know what is most meaningful to you

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.630
how much of your time you spend actively

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.130
engaged in the things that you're doing

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.809
do you spend your days on subreddits

00:40:16.809 --> 00:40:18.099
getting yourself worked up about [ __ ]

00:40:18.099 --> 00:40:19.450
comedy podcasts I threw that in

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:22.299
obviously simply put is your life

00:40:22.299 --> 00:40:24.640
characterized actually those words up

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.049
top or actually mine this is the

00:40:26.049 --> 00:40:27.350
author's they're way more coherent

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:28.940
make poor sense is your life

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.220
characterized by vitality and engagement

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.040
or by the weight of your problems so are

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.630
you thinking about that [ __ ] you'd like

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:37.670
to do and thinking about doing it or

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:40.310
instead are you being like mom I'm

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:42.530
[ __ ] this or that and I was at the

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:44.330
party you know what he laughed at me

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.310
when I said that thing and I felt dumb

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.810
or are you thinking about your next move

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:52.130
it's that [ __ ] simple all right so

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:53.120
let's go back here

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.470
so there we got the [ __ ] plan

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:57.260
we got the intro diving to chapter 1 let

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.940
me see what time she is yeah we're going

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.320
we're were steamrolling right through

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.690
chapter 1 trying to do a quick podcast

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:03.830
to I don't want this thing to be dragged

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:06.590
out alright chapter 1 - by the way as a

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.840
whole chapter on human suffering so you

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.130
know you might ask questions like why

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:11.870
does my life suck so [ __ ] bad why

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.280
can't I just get over it why hasn't

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.600
there be work why can't I feel better

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.430
why can't I be normal why can't I be

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.800
happy and we can get out of this nego

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.680
prison by clicking here alright so as I

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.510
said before again we did the intro some

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.830
of this might be redundant but again I

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:28.220
wanted to paint you know a picture now

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.290
we're gonna get real into it human

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.270
suffering as we said before is universal

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:34.130
all human beings if they live long

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.410
enough will have felt the devastation of

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.020
losing someone they love everyone has or

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.630
will feel physical pain everyone feels

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.120
sadness shame humiliation regret anxiety

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.310
fear and loss we all carry painful

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:50.030
secrets but we all put on our shiny

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.650
happy faces and pretend that everything

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:53.990
is okay that life is all good but it

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.540
isn't and it can't be to be human and is

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.580
to feel pain in ways that are orders of

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.980
magnitude more pervasive than what other

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.780
creatures on this planet feel and it's

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.830
also one of those things - whenever

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.180
you're feeling like like I don't know if

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.070
you ever lost your keys before I've lost

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.230
my car keys in Philly then like you're

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.310
looking around for your keys and

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:11.930
instantly the world becomes transformed

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:13.400
between those who have their keys and

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.630
those who don't so it's like the world

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:16.220
has their keys you [ __ ] don't you're

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.050
just walking around seeing people beep

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:20.270
your key fobs or [ __ ] why can't I

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:21.440
have my keys what does everyone have

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.540
cheese besides me that goes on - and

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.530
you're depressed it's like you think the

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.030
whole world is just like zippity-doo-dah

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.010
and you're the only person but it's it's

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:30.290
it's all of us we're all [ __ ] up all

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.300
right so all right life sucks we get it

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.480
what else we got yes life does suck and

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.040
here's why and this is again this this

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.110
gets into the kind of the illusion of

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:40.490
language and how language

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:42.830
Texas so if you kick a dog every time

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:44.390
you come home this was the stuff BF

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.610
Skinner was into the guy who uh Pavlov's

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:48.740
dogs and all that [ __ ] you kick a dog

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.690
every time you come home the dog will

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.490
eventually fear you it will associate

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.140
the sight smell or sound of your arrival

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.790
with being kicked in either cower or

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:57.890
flee when you open the door though as

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:00.650
long as you aren't around the dog it is

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:02.600
most likely chilling and not in a

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.850
fearful state granted all of its other

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.260
survival needs are met and again if you

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.490
beat the [ __ ] out of a dog you know

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:09.110
it'll be [ __ ] up a little bit but it's

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.140
like you know if you well I'll get into

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.520
that but that's not how we work you know

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.720
and again it's one of those things were

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.030
like and this is all this this gets into

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:20.630
like how human beings can you know this

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:22.160
is gonna sound you don't need to notice

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.740
right now but we derive relationships

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.840
through language we do we derive like

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.130
two-way connections we're like you know

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.500
a dog is like oh the sound of my owner

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.660
coming home I'm gonna get kicked but

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.740
that's it it's just the sound of the

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.970
owner getting home and come and kick but

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:36.560
here's how human beings work our brains

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:40.220
are a lot more complex all right this is

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.440
our uncanny ability to bug ourselves out

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.300
so our capacity for language makes it so

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.740
that we can link almost anything this

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.570
what I was saying about like one one

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:49.490
directional Association versus two

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:51.560
directional relations remember our

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.150
capacity for language makes it so that

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:54.859
we can link almost every almost an

00:43:54.859 --> 00:43:56.690
infinite amount of thing senses sights

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.150
and thoughts to any undesirable stimuli

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:01.010
meaning like somebody kicking us when

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:02.030
they come home so if you're a human

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:03.710
being someone kicks you and they come

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:05.540
home you know there's there's so many

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:06.950
other things you can relate to it and be

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:09.560
afraid of namely your own thoughts to

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.180
which you can never get away from but

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.240
anyway so say the dog is rescued I might

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.380
get a little nervous and you know

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.940
sketched out initially when you know

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:18.050
it's in your house I don't if you have a

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.550
rescued a dog for like two weeks they're

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.590
[ __ ] weird they just like kind of

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.420
look at you what the [ __ ] going on but

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.010
generally after you know a little bit of

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:26.930
time most abused dogs bounce back to

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.400
their ideal life of just like you know

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.410
chasing [ __ ] and enjoying themselves

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:32.390
relatively soon after being put into a

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:34.369
new loving environment because the

00:44:34.369 --> 00:44:36.380
previously frightening stimulus is gone

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.060
they don't have the verbal memories they

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.210
don't have the ability to relate like

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.530
well I'll get into it so meanwhile if

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:44.109
the same thing had occurred to a human

00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:47.000
right we got home every day there are

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.730
dad you know hopefully don't have owners

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:52.670
our dad or mom whoever came back and his

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.410
[ __ ] beat the [ __ ] out of us

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:56.329
we'd constantly be reminded of being

00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:58.579
kicked by the sight of an abusive father

00:44:58.579 --> 00:45:00.470
on TV the smell of cigarettes and coffee

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:03.020
someone taking off a belt keys jangling

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.490
in the door seeing a plaid shirt the

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:06.260
word abuse kick the phrase kicking ass

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.049
it just anything can this boom triggers

00:45:09.049 --> 00:45:11.839
to that memory through you know just the

00:45:11.839 --> 00:45:13.579
objects in the world and our ability to

00:45:13.579 --> 00:45:15.289
have multiple relations with them like

00:45:15.289 --> 00:45:16.760
the fact that we can see a rock that's a

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:17.150
rock

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:18.589
my dad threw a rock at me I'm not

00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:19.849
looking at a rock right now I'm looking

00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:21.260
at something that symbolizes a horrible

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.970
thing that happened to me and having a

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:25.069
biological response to that and that's

00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:26.119
that you know that's the predicament

00:45:26.119 --> 00:45:28.690
human beings over bit are in right now

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:32.839
all right now this is this is an

00:45:32.839 --> 00:45:34.490
exercise from the book think of the most

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:36.530
shameful thing you have ever done and

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:38.569
then part of the thing of this the book

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:40.369
and you know act is like you got to

00:45:40.369 --> 00:45:41.690
actually do the [ __ ] you know you can

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:43.849
just listen around and whatever but

00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:45.440
really take time think about the most

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.089
shameful thing you've ever done pause it

00:45:47.089 --> 00:45:48.559
if you have to and just get into it for

00:45:48.559 --> 00:45:50.059
a minute just think of something you did

00:45:50.059 --> 00:45:53.030
that was just like oh [ __ ] I wish I

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.589
didn't do that like I have a memory from

00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:58.369
when I was really little of these kids

00:45:58.369 --> 00:45:59.630
started to fight they're older and they

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:01.069
started to fight with me and my cousins

00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:03.349
and well they're yeah they were a little

00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:05.569
bit older than us and then their older

00:46:05.569 --> 00:46:06.980
brother came down and was like Holman -

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.960
[ __ ] you guys up in our thank God my

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.250
older cousin happened to be walking by

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:13.130
and he came and started beating the [ __ ]

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:14.539
out of their older for an older brother

00:46:14.539 --> 00:46:17.089
and then another kid he was a little bit

00:46:17.089 --> 00:46:19.819
older than me started going at me and I

00:46:19.819 --> 00:46:22.190
just I froze I was like if you think

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:23.599
about it it's like you know this is a

00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:25.490
perfect example it's like I had spent

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:27.589
the bulk of my years getting the [ __ ]

00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:29.059
kicked out of me by my older brothers so

00:46:29.059 --> 00:46:31.130
it's like I see a person coming at me

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:32.990
this isn't a person like you like I

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.029
can't look at him and be like oh we're

00:46:35.029 --> 00:46:36.079
about the same size I could probably

00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:38.210
fight this guy I had already fused with

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:39.980
the thought that like if some everybody

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.890
could kick my ass because a my for my

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:45.049
experience so far was everybody in my

00:46:45.049 --> 00:46:47.390
life could kick my ass so this guy came

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:49.130
at me who I probably could have fought

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:51.529
and I just just was like oh I froze I

00:46:51.529 --> 00:46:54.200
completely froze up and uh luckily my

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.819
cousin's a [ __ ] animal he ended up

00:46:55.819 --> 00:46:57.289
like kicking the one guy in the head and

00:46:57.289 --> 00:46:59.029
then I think threw a punch to the other

00:46:59.029 --> 00:47:00.920
kid and he just ran away but either way

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.510
that was emotion I I that when I read

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.010
the book I thought about that just my

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:05.089
cousin who looked at me and was like

00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:06.650
what the [ __ ] cause it was like he's

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:07.880
fighting is already fighting this older

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:08.310
kid now

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:09.270
to fight two people and I'm just

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:10.970
standing there like a [ __ ] [ __ ] oh

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:14.430
man I still down miss like [ __ ] dude

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:17.070
pisses me off that's that's the idea and

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:18.690
like so you know so I'll move into it

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:19.770
and it's like alright so what did you

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:20.180
feel

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.410
grant you didn't just [ __ ] out and skip

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:23.400
thinking about the time you [ __ ]

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.690
yourself on the waterslide or peed

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:26.070
someone else's bed after drinking all

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.750
night you probably felt a sense of shame

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:29.700
and all that took was some words on a

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.950
page to elicit a deep sense of shame for

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:34.590
you and again that's that's what human

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:37.140
beings rub against so anything humans

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.030
learn in one direction we derive into

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:40.620
like I tried to say earlier but I was

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.060
too dumb and I needed the actual author

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.760
to have the words they're so meaning we

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.380
have the capacity to treat anything as a

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.090
symbol for something else and not only

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:49.830
do not only that we do this

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:52.320
automatically without thinking so what

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.740
do we do well what we try to do is we

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.330
try to avoid pain altogether because

00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:58.710
it's so befuddling it's like we are

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:01.200
wired to just torture wired to solve

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.480
problems use our brain is like how do we

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.040
develop a building how do you most

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.010
efficiently you know grow crops and how

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:09.330
do we feed countries that can't feed

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:12.330
themselves and it's like how do I you

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:14.670
know save face after stuttering at my

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:16.290
eighth grade or like you know stuttering

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:17.610
at the eighth grade spelling bee it's

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:18.450
like we're gonna apply our

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:20.250
problem-solving brains to a thing that

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:22.140
it's it's not there anymore and we're

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.360
like but only if I did this but and it

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.670
just it never [ __ ] ends so here's how

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.100
we try to avoid pain altogether we

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.510
typically do this through dissociation

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.190
just meaning we cut ourselves off from

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:34.260
feelings altogether which is a good

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.910
short-term thing but then it's like you

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:38.670
know yeah maybe one day you get married

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:40.170
you don't feel anything on the days

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:41.490
you're supposed to feel [ __ ] and you're

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:42.840
just like what the [ __ ] wrong with me

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.610
I feel distance for my life but I won't

00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:45.210
get into that

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:47.910
so dissociation drug use projection

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:50.910
denial seeking power control or by

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:52.650
avoiding certain events places or people

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:54.150
things book movies the list goes on

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:55.440
forever but none of that [ __ ] works

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.060
either I'm just cutting off your

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.650
feelings doesn't work drug use doesn't

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:00.510
work projection doesn't work denial

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:02.490
seeking power control doesn't [ __ ]

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.670
work and then again I'm scared of you

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:07.470
know being in crowds let me just avoid

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.120
crowds now my socialized [ __ ] up but

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.890
again we'll get into that to know this

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:12.930
[ __ ] works society's [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:15.730
man is there any

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:17.920
thing that can be done please tell me

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.690
there is something well there is and

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.850
that is changing our relationship to

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:24.220
pain in one of acceptance rather than

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.040
constant suffering and again the futile

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.690
attempts to try to regulate or control

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:31.450
the fact that we are feeling pain and

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:33.430
suffering all the time if we're trying

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:35.230
to control it it just gets worse if we

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:37.630
accept it if we get with it we can

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:40.030
accept it for what it is and it doesn't

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.609
have as much of an effect on us so all

00:49:42.609 --> 00:49:47.020
right let's go forward all right yeah

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.030
the thing if you're you know if you're

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:50.530
listening to it at the button say if I

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:52.470
click this when my life still suck and

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:55.270
yes yes we were on the next slide our

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:58.660
lives will suck right like we're even if

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.190
we accept the fact that our lives are

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:01.930
gonna have really shitty sucky parts

00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:05.710
about them they'll still suck but again

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:06.880
I'll read I'll just read the quote by

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.470
accepting the painful parts of our

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:09.880
existence and trying to get with them

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.100
again think quicksand we can align our

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.720
behaviors towards something other than

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.820
trying to bring it in to our pervasive

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.070
sense of suffering through behaviors

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:20.109
that only reduce our quality of life and

00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:22.240
caused us even more pain in the long

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.540
term and we're you know we're hovering

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.160
around some sort of solution just and

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.660
here's a cool fact from the book the

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.910
primary root of suffer is the Latin

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:34.450
frere which means to bear or carry the

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:36.010
English word fairy comes from the same

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:38.320
root the pre-six stuff is a version of

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.109
sub and in this usage means from below

00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:44.770
up hence away the word suffer connotes

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:46.900
the idea that there is a burden you are

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.880
unwilling or unable to carry perhaps

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.280
because it seems too heavy too unfair or

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.100
just seems beyond you right so that

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.290
connotation refers more to just pain

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:57.850
which is like I'm nervous

00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:00.190
in fact it provides a different way to

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.930
address the problem of pain so it's like

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:04.270
suffering suffering is buying into the

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:06.790
idea that it's like why me like you know

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:08.560
you stub your toe and that [ __ ] hurts

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.730
but then you said they're gonna always

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:13.570
stub my toe why am I so all right so

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:14.920
whatever how do I do this [ __ ] you're

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.050
talking about all right

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:20.950
actually let me pause real quick yeah

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:24.760
let me pause hold up boat alright we

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.660
back we back way back way back yeah

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.220
get the screen back up here god damn

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:33.880
Prezi so [ __ ] sick dude um all right

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.790
we're in presentation mode all right so

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:38.140
here's something we can do this is a way

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:39.940
to kind of start to get a gauge on this

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:42.250
overwhelmingly huge and pervasive and

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:44.620
automatically baked into our thought

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.900
process process problem so something

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:48.130
called a suffering inventory and again

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:51.490
this is from the book so you divide two

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:54.070
columns painful and difficult issues I

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:55.900
experienced and how long they have been

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.570
the case so and they can be anywhere so

00:51:58.570 --> 00:52:00.970
you you want to have like think of like

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:03.430
seven or eight or you know maybe you

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:04.990
only have two or three but just keep it

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:06.910
don't go more than seven or eight you

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:08.890
know because anything more than seven or

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:10.810
eight painful deeply painful things

00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:13.390
about you might morph into a manifesto

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:14.830
and we're not into that we don't need

00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:18.280
that but okay so you you and I'll show

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.290
you an example of this but it okay you

00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:21.430
know what I'll just show you the example

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.230
because I'm just gonna trip over myself

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:26.110
explaining this all right

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:28.420
so organize the list right of all your

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:30.580
most painful things or not you know

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.170
you'll have to go wild with it but it's

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:35.500
like think of things you know list every

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.600
kind of thought or thing you think about

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.760
yourself or things going on in your life

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.410
and it could just be like an illness

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:45.550
they could be some sort of state of

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:47.500
relationships divorce anything just

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.180
think of whatever is [ __ ] bugging you

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.220
list at all anything that's easy way to

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:53.140
put it whatever's bugging you just write

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.580
that all down don't even worry about it

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.380
it's write it all down and then go back

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:59.320
and then rank it right so one causing

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:01.240
the most trouble two causing slightly

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.100
less than 1/3 causing slightly less than

00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:04.980
two you know you know what you're doing

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:08.530
once this is done draw an arrow between

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:10.720
every item that could possibly be

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.510
related right so it's like can't stop

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:17.080
drinking I got a divorce well what are

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:17.920
you complaining that you're an alcoholic

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.420
you know I mean like [ __ ] like that

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:21.370
so once you've related your issue see if

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:23.020
you can condense that list down and

00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:25.060
again no real right or wrong just

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.070
whatever makes sense to you do it here

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.510
show me an example you [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:32.020
right here's an example alright again

00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.330
these are my examples again don't don't

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:36.760
tease me but here here's what I did in

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.940
the book so it's like it's just again

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.470
one column of per

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:42.640
painful and difficult issues I

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:44.440
experience I have anxiety anger fear of

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.180
judgment lack of emotional connection

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:48.340
poor sense of self-worth poor discipline

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:50.020
poor relationships romantic obviously

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:51.910
but you know that's getting better how

00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:54.430
long has it been the case 22 off and on

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:56.140
forever forever forever forever well

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:57.970
getting better and forever but the last

00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:01.390
ones getting better too um all right and

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:02.710
the other one again this is this is

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:05.530
showing you here so I have so I rewrite

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:07.060
them everything fear judgments number

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.800
one two is lack of emotional connection

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.050
freeze anxiety anger I then went back

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.180
and drew arrows it's like alright so

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:15.310
fear of judgment is set as linked to

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:18.280
poor sense of self fear of judgments all

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.950
solely linked to anger poor disciplines

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:22.420
length the poor sense of link to poor

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.710
sense of self so you can see you know

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:26.020
again this is just some I could probably

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.130
do this tomorrow and it'd all be

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.599
different but it's like well you know

00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:30.849
what that's a lie this is pretty much my

00:54:30.849 --> 00:54:33.190
[ __ ] but it does change there today

00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:34.540
and again it's one of those things that

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:36.460
you can work with and change and you

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:37.960
know cross stuff out this is all

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.840
supposed to just come like gut reaction

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.359
so once you link all the sources of like

00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:44.470
you know this actually might come from

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:46.230
this and you know fear judgment might

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:49.630
you know poor discipline my poor

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:50.650
discipline might be linked to poor

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:52.030
self-worth so I can get rid of poor

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:53.380
discipline so at the end of it you

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:54.910
condense it into all the things that are

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:56.589
related what does it boil down to

00:54:56.589 --> 00:54:58.150
I can just say fear judgment of

00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:59.530
listening negative emotions from others

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:02.410
a freer judgment or fear of listening

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:04.390
negative emotions anxiety about personal

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:06.339
health low self-worth now out of the

00:55:06.339 --> 00:55:07.599
seven I boiled it down to like three

00:55:07.599 --> 00:55:10.060
main ones and again might be too much

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:11.830
personal detail but I at this point in

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:13.240
my life man I don't really give a [ __ ]

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.000
you guys know anything about all right

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.619
so the personal suffering also by the

00:55:17.619 --> 00:55:20.080
way like do this right don't you know if

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.220
you just want to listen and learn [ __ ]

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.770
that's fine but if you again going by

00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:25.570
the book it's helpful if you're too much

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:27.700
of a po boy for the book I can see if I

00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.589
can produce some sort of like watermark

00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:31.000
copy I'll ask the dude if it's cool I

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.140
give it to people alright so the

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.550
personal suffering list this is very

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:37.780
important to do it's very important to

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:40.240
think it on do honestly because you know

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.230
if you're lying to yourself in a

00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:43.560
workbook what's the [ __ ] are you doing

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.359
so this is what this book is about for

00:55:46.359 --> 00:55:47.859
you so I and I'm gonna try to go through

00:55:47.859 --> 00:55:49.089
this whole book so whether you buy it or

00:55:49.089 --> 00:55:50.290
not you're gonna get at least an idea

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:51.940
and be able to try to relate to it

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:53.470
yourself but either way this personal

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:54.890
suffering list is important

00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:56.539
I'm showing it to you because this is

00:55:56.539 --> 00:55:59.000
what this whole book is about for you

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.890
you're gonna use these things to try to

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:04.849
pass through them alright XP points I

00:56:04.849 --> 00:56:07.010
don't know if you guys saw that alright

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:08.599
so now that we've identified sources of

00:56:08.599 --> 00:56:10.160
pain let's think about there two part

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.700
nature this is true of all pain and

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.930
again I think it's true you you know you

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:16.579
be the judge so there's the pain of

00:56:16.579 --> 00:56:17.299
presence right

00:56:17.299 --> 00:56:18.559
this is anxiety depression low

00:56:18.559 --> 00:56:20.539
self-esteem these all these are all

00:56:20.539 --> 00:56:22.339
things that suck when experienced in the

00:56:22.339 --> 00:56:24.170
moment and we all deal with some

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:26.990
combination or variance of these things

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:29.510
at some point in our life so it's like

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:31.970
all right I'll give it a you know what a

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:35.480
good example is um say you're you know

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.789
say you're socially anxious and you're

00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:39.650
scared to go to parties so there's the

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:41.690
pain of present someone says hey man you

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:43.160
want to come to a party you go oh god

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.260
I'm gonna go there and I stand there

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:46.609
like a weirdo and I don't know how to

00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:49.369
have conversations and my girlfriend's

00:56:49.369 --> 00:56:51.289
gonna look at me and she's just hanging

00:56:51.289 --> 00:56:52.490
out talking to people and I'm standing

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:53.839
by myself and I don't know how to break

00:56:53.839 --> 00:56:55.309
into a conversation circle I just feel

00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:56.750
like a [ __ ] weirdo I want to go home

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:58.579
I don't want to go or being anxious

00:56:58.579 --> 00:57:00.619
right that's the pain of presence now

00:57:00.619 --> 00:57:02.029
here's the pain of avoidance alright

00:57:02.029 --> 00:57:03.319
like so what if this is the other part

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:04.849
of suffering this is the way in which we

00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:07.339
limit / treat ourselves so as to avoid

00:57:07.339 --> 00:57:09.529
our painful thoughts of feelings eg I

00:57:09.529 --> 00:57:11.299
don't want to go to the party nobody's

00:57:11.299 --> 00:57:14.000
gonna like me I'm gonna feel weird so

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.339
say we don't go to the party right we're

00:57:16.339 --> 00:57:18.859
like [ __ ] it I'm not going now it's like

00:57:18.859 --> 00:57:20.630
because of the fact that we're socially

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:23.660
anxious now we stop socializing so to

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:26.269
avoid a short term pain which might be

00:57:26.269 --> 00:57:27.589
feeling a little bit weird at a party

00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:28.670
for a little bit you know and then it

00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:30.049
settles or it it doesn't you know and

00:57:30.049 --> 00:57:31.910
you just feel weird the whole time but

00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:33.680
in order but at least you're socializing

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.660
so there's a pain of presence being

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:36.829
nervous and then there's a pain of

00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:38.210
avoidance which once you just stop going

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:40.819
to parties all together imagine six

00:57:40.819 --> 00:57:42.109
years from now you've just never gone to

00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:43.339
a party in six years and now you're

00:57:43.339 --> 00:57:45.259
feeling a deep pain of loneliness that

00:57:45.259 --> 00:57:48.440
now is a new pain on top of this social

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.849
anxiety that you didn't push and move

00:57:49.849 --> 00:57:52.220
through instead of instead of pushing

00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:53.509
and moving through your social anxiety

00:57:53.509 --> 00:57:56.900
you chose to ignore it and avoid like a

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:59.869
scary situation to treat your short-term

00:57:59.869 --> 00:58:02.539
fear and this applies to anything so

00:58:02.539 --> 00:58:04.220
it's like but this is an easy example so

00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:05.539
it's like you would have short-term fear

00:58:05.539 --> 00:58:07.670
you battle it you don't pass through the

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:08.630
fear gate you

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:10.160
don't go to the party you don't suck it

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:12.440
up and just [ __ ] you know deal with

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.970
it in real time get help do whatever you

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:15.740
got to do you just avoid it and by

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.510
avoiding things that make us you know

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:20.690
feel pain it usually I think always

00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:22.010
honestly if you think about it I'll let

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:23.090
you know obviously wouldn't you put your

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:24.470
hand on house oh shut the [ __ ] up I'm

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:25.850
talking about [ __ ] like you want to

00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:27.080
actually do you should be doing all

00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.230
right don't be it [ __ ] smartest

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:31.760
so we avoid the parties forever and then

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:33.380
now we're lonely and we're still scared

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:34.790
of parties that's the pain of avoidance

00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:37.400
the long-term effects of avoiding the

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.690
things that scare us it just only

00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:43.460
compounds our pain hmm so and you got to

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:45.140
think about this what would you be doing

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:47.360
if you didn't feel so shitty right

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.150
here's a case example I made up Aaron is

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:51.770
a sex addicted got sex addicted

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:53.690
alcoholic whenever he sees his

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:55.280
ex-girlfriend who he broke up with

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.260
because he cheated or who broke up with

00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:59.570
him because he cheated share a pic on

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:01.370
with her new boyfriend on Instagram

00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:02.990
right so Aaron's a sex addicted

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:04.280
alcoholic whenever he sees his

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.410
ex-girlfriend put a picture with her and

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:07.910
a new boyfriend on Instagram he

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:10.250
typically goes out gets drunk buy some

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:11.990
coke hires prostitutes while in his

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:14.030
drunken yakked out state so Aaron's

00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:15.740
feeling the pain he's going on man my

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.870
you know he's depressed he's spiteful

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:20.600
he's looking at his exes he's viewing

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.130
this like I can't believe she left me

00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.810
after I just slipped up once and you

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:25.280
know it's not my fault I have this I

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.690
don't know how to control my sexual

00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:29.240
impulses and then on top of this you

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.170
know this is the pain of presence

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:33.340
[ __ ] [ __ ] goddamn [ __ ] I'm mad

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:35.780
I'll never be able to find anyone I'll

00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.460
never be able to sustain a relationship

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:39.920
and maybe I'll die alone I'm just a

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.990
disgusting unlovable whoremonger and

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:43.880
[ __ ] man that's just who I am

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.950
[ __ ] this I'm you know so it's like

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:47.180
that's the pain of presence that's him

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.830
seeing his girlfriend an Instagram

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:50.810
having all these bad feelings and what

00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:53.510
does he do he goes out gets drunk buys

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:55.460
coke [ __ ] hookers which again you know

00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.680
if you're if you like this [ __ ] that's

00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.930
fine maybe doing all those things if

00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.850
you're john mcafee that's it that's

01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:05.180
Tuesday he's that he's happy with it but

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.770
again if you're Aaron and they say in

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.960
this case it's like that behavior

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.760
pattern is keeping you from things that

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.350
you might find more meaningful which you

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:14.000
know I would advise I think most people

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.250
would so this is now the pain of absence

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.720
so this is kind of a complicated example

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.950
but it's like alright so Aaron now he

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:20.240
said he's had the bad thoughts you went

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.319
out and did coke

01:00:21.319 --> 01:00:22.999
from doing those things of like doing

01:00:22.999 --> 01:00:24.709
the coke having sex with [ __ ] and you

01:00:24.709 --> 01:00:26.630
know reinforcing this idea that like

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:28.160
these are the old this is the only

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.199
people I can actually you know identify

01:00:30.199 --> 01:00:32.329
with you know again think about you get

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:33.529
brought you get broken up with or

01:00:33.529 --> 01:00:34.940
whatever so then you only want to deal

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.140
with prostitutes why because you have

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.869
total control you pay you have sex you

01:00:38.869 --> 01:00:40.369
control for the most part you know

01:00:40.369 --> 01:00:42.829
somewhat actually a lot more than anyone

01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:44.329
else you control the interaction maybe

01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:47.900
that's why you know it's so enticing as

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.640
it is so now Aaron fully fused with the

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.769
self concept of this unlovable pervert

01:00:51.769 --> 01:00:54.319
declines an offer for from his body for

01:00:54.319 --> 01:00:55.910
a double date deletes his dating

01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:58.130
profiles and six months later he starts

01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:00.109
to feel the pain of actually being alone

01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:02.869
due to his earlier coping mechanisms so

01:01:02.869 --> 01:01:04.069
again you get the idea

01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:06.739
feeling that rush of like shame and how

01:01:06.739 --> 01:01:07.880
do I get rid of the shame and yell you

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.769
do behaviors you know then you just kind

01:01:09.769 --> 01:01:11.299
of start limiting your life based on

01:01:11.299 --> 01:01:13.910
this idea of yourself that you just

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:15.469
fused with by yourself you didn't run it

01:01:15.469 --> 01:01:16.640
by everybody because it's embarrassing

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.190
so you just go yeah I am a disgusting

01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:21.619
alcoholic pervert and I just deserve to

01:01:21.619 --> 01:01:24.079
lay and [ __ ] Skid Row with [ __ ] and

01:01:24.079 --> 01:01:26.449
do dirty coke with baby laxatives it's

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:28.219
like where'd you get that idea

01:01:28.219 --> 01:01:29.660
you made that [ __ ] up and then you you

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:32.239
you fuse with it you you take that on

01:01:32.239 --> 01:01:33.979
but it's like maybe you're just having a

01:01:33.979 --> 01:01:35.329
tough [ __ ] time dude and maybe you

01:01:35.329 --> 01:01:36.949
knock off the [ __ ] then you have a

01:01:36.949 --> 01:01:37.969
girlfriend and she's like eh you're

01:01:37.969 --> 01:01:39.829
pretty great you're like okay well

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:41.150
thought it was a disgusting piece of

01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:42.529
[ __ ] maybe I'll keep this for stuff to

01:01:42.529 --> 01:01:45.829
myself alright there's another exercise

01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:47.599
so this is this is called the pain is

01:01:47.599 --> 01:01:49.190
gone now what and this is how we can

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:53.680
identify our own pain of avoidance right

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.109
so right so if blank wasn't such a

01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:59.630
problem for me I would blank and another

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:01.549
question is if I didn't have blank

01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:04.069
I would blank so again personal example

01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:05.900
if this is one I've kind of gotten

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.329
actually I've gotten over pretty much

01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:09.949
all of these but you know still battle

01:02:09.949 --> 01:02:12.229
of them if health anxiety wasn't such a

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.039
problem for me

01:02:13.039 --> 01:02:15.259
I would be jacked like West Boston and

01:02:15.259 --> 01:02:17.239
sit in parks with my shirt off talking

01:02:17.239 --> 01:02:18.709
into webcam about prison rather than

01:02:18.709 --> 01:02:20.329
making some stupid PowerPoint of frumpy

01:02:20.329 --> 01:02:24.259
sweat suit and yeah just going back you

01:02:24.259 --> 01:02:25.969
know in my personal history I used to

01:02:25.969 --> 01:02:28.069
suffer from this weird fear that I was

01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:30.619
going to have a heart attack and you

01:02:30.619 --> 01:02:32.359
know I thought any kind of aerobic

01:02:32.359 --> 01:02:33.949
exercise wouldn't like I was like this

01:02:33.949 --> 01:02:34.220
soon

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.630
my heart rate went up I was like oh god

01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:37.220
it would trigger a panic panic attack

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.390
thinking like I'm gonna have a [ __ ]

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:41.840
heart attack so I spent like a couple

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.910
years of my life were like I wouldn't go

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:46.310
to a G I wouldn't work out I like and if

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:48.170
I did work out I'd like soon as my heart

01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:49.220
rate went up I'd have to lay down like

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:51.670
oh god oh my god I'm gonna pass out um

01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:53.750
and that was earlier in my life I was

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.670
back when I Dorn for my first marriage

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:58.220
when I was a I mean I might as well have

01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:59.869
been in iguana my level of consciousness

01:02:59.869 --> 01:03:02.599
was really [ __ ] low but you know the

01:03:02.599 --> 01:03:04.580
the the the the thing and again he

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:07.970
talked about you know the what is it the

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:09.440
pain of avoidance let me go back to

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.770
school about president oh [ __ ] so again

01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:15.500
pain of presence I'm like all [ __ ] man

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.609
I'm gonna have a heart attack I'm

01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:17.660
freaking out I'm having all these

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.980
negative feelings so what do I do

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:21.500
stop working out dude I'm not gonna you

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.000
know it's like whoa what the [ __ ] is

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.790
this sorry I'm the PowerPoint shaking or

01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:28.730
my Prezi shaking so again I'm like oh my

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:30.680
god I'm gonna have a heart attack you

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.150
know so it's like I stopped working out

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:34.369
what happens now I'm [ __ ] you know

01:03:34.369 --> 01:03:36.140
I'm gaining weight I'm out of shape and

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.240
again I personally value trying to stay

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.650
in shape not like ya'll must be like

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:41.510
ripped but it's like I want my body to

01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:43.400
work that's a value of mine and I was

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.260
acting against the interest of my

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:46.670
personal values to alleviate a

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:48.890
short-term suffering which was my own

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:50.839
anxiety that was based on nothing

01:03:50.839 --> 01:03:52.190
because I went to a cardiologist and

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:53.240
they were like yeah dude your heart's

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.460
fine so this is just that's one example

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.070
a fear of judgment weren't a problem I'd

01:03:58.070 --> 01:03:59.480
have been started the church at sacred

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.660
dogology Sunday service r.i.p that one

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:03.560
because I definitely did that

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.880
r.i.p the health anxiety because now

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.460
I've gotten over that and I didn't have

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.020
such a hard time this is one that's kind

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.339
of more vague and I've learned through

01:04:10.339 --> 01:04:11.750
personal therapy I didn't have such a

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:15.140
hard time expressing my needs my needs I

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.720
would be able to say no to things and

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.589
have far less stressful days yeah that's

01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:22.070
my problem

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:24.589
but that one work in progress all right

01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:27.589
wrap it up all right so the alternative

01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:29.570
so again this is all like what the [ __ ]

01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:31.190
am I gonna do so here's the alternative

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:32.720
to living a life that sounds like it was

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.130
written by DMX because I feel like I

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:36.619
said pain and suffering a lot so if you

01:04:36.619 --> 01:04:38.240
agree with what has been said so far you

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.220
now know that living a life dedicated

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.780
towards insulating ourselves from pain

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.300
and suffering only leads to more

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.710
long-term pain and suffering

01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:49.290
and it also also it constricts our lives

01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:51.390
through avoidance into lives we end up

01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:53.070
not really liking why because they're

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:54.450
not aligned to our personal values so

01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:56.790
what do we do figure out what we value

01:04:56.790 --> 01:04:59.099
and we move towards that using the

01:04:59.099 --> 01:05:00.660
things that give us meaning and

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:02.760
filtering our decisions through that

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.349
which aligns with our personal

01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:06.900
value-based goals again this doesn't

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.450
have to be like you know when you hear

01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:11.670
goals it's just like six-pack by summer

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:13.830
it can just be like you know think

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:15.599
relational goals better relationship my

01:05:15.599 --> 01:05:16.830
mom better relationship my dad better

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:17.820
relationship with my wife better

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:21.030
relationship with myself you know have

01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:23.040
the courage to ask for a raise [ __ ] like

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.010
that which again sounds easy but this

01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:27.540
involves us moving through our own

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.520
personal fear gates this is what I call

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.570
it when you you know what I did the

01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:32.339
Church of sacred dogology last week I

01:05:32.339 --> 01:05:33.900
was super nervous dude I didn't know

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:35.760
what I was going to do how's this gonna

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:36.869
be weird people and I think I'm a

01:05:36.869 --> 01:05:39.510
[ __ ] weirdo and it was just I just do

01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:40.859
that was a big fear gate for me it's

01:05:40.859 --> 01:05:42.300
like you know that's that was initially

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.670
started as like a one-man thing where I

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:46.230
had to come in and it was just

01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:48.180
uncomfortable dude like religious shit's

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:49.619
weird and uncomfortable and this was

01:05:49.619 --> 01:05:52.680
like not even like inherently whatever

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:53.970
I'm not gonna get too lost on that but

01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:55.950
it was like it was uncomfortable it was

01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:57.750
very uh I'd made myself I was in a very

01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:01.530
vulnerable state you know you know I was

01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:05.220
walking through like a [ __ ] minefield and

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:07.080
they you know III knew I could get hit

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.540
at any minute and I just stoic ly walk

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:10.380
through and it's one of those things

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.430
were like you passed through and you're

01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:13.290
like everyone had a good time I'm glad I

01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:14.490
you know the Church of dogology is

01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:16.470
pretty fun we got to do it it was fun

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:18.660
everyone seemed to find meaning from it

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:19.830
you know at least I did and a lot of

01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:21.660
other people did so that was something I

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.849
again pain of avoidance it was like I

01:06:23.849 --> 01:06:25.170
knew I wanted to do something like that

01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:26.820
I knew I want to try to create some sort

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:29.550
of online space where people would just

01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:31.349
somehow derive meaning from it it's free

01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:34.050
something that's just like a thing to be

01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:35.580
done in an experience to be had rather

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.260
than like a commodity to be bought sold

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.810
or reproduced whatever this is just can

01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:41.250
you come up with some sort of experience

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:43.290
that people find beneficial you know

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:44.730
people who find it beneficial can come

01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:45.210
and do it

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:47.160
that isn't too agendized that's what I

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.839
wanted to create I felt too weird than I

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:50.910
did it now I feel good all right but

01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:52.320
either way all that shit's in another

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.750
chapter that's actually way later on the

01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:56.250
next chapter is a deep dive into the

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:59.089
whole idea of how we derive multi or

01:06:59.089 --> 01:07:00.800
multi-directional

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.320
ships between language and how like you

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.820
know how language just [ __ ] us up

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.230
that's the next chapter but that's it

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.060
for now hopefully that wasn't too long

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:11.530
and hopefully Prezi was sick alright

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:15.430
that's it we're done
