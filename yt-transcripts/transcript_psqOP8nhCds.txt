uh i feel worse about people dying next

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.680
question it's like

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.960
dude what the [ __ ] but

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.360
yeah man it goes back to the idea of

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.400
like

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.560
so you know we have the news the news is

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.240
a for-profit company

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.280

let's like tune into reality but it's

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:45.840
like your information is being kind of

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.440
distorted by like what's profitable and

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.120
not profitable not like what's true

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.039

sexual assault on her we're just

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:42.720
watching like the seventh season of

girls

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.639
that's why the seventh season they all

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:51.040

yeah i think that's kind of going to be

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.440
the point of the show because the girl

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.400
then

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.160
ignores the sexual assault and calls her

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.760
back to make the sale

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.880

the end of the episode

i mean dude cutting someone's head off

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.679
is a pretty serious act of [ __ ]

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:27.360
violence that is

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.799
beheading a person not even like if you

00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:34.159
ritual yeah but yeah they're fired up

00:29:34.159 --> 00:29:35.360
they're they're starting to get they're

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.320
starting to fire up

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.840
right now and also you know i think

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.880
we're doing a little musical chairs

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.399
we're getting the next thing ready

00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:41.600
yeah because that was what i was reading

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.960
to about the news it was like when oh

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.399
yeah once kovac dies out

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:46.720
one pulitzer was like it becomes the

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.159
symbiosis of like

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:51.360
so the news needs um catastrophe to

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.640
constantly get people to start buying

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.120
you know

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.720
drake joining us like we're watching the

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.240
local news with like hurricane off of

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.799
cuba

00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:59.200
yeah and exactly right okay is it gonna

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.279
rain tomorrow but the politicians also

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:03.520
get to like become like characters in

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.799
these stories and be like like they were

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:06.799
talking about uh

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:09.200
reagan how he did the national debt and

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.080
he's like we've got to bring this

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.440
national debt down and the news was like

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.880
reagan's at it again

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.080
there are more meetings that all they

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.679
ever did was increase the national debt

00:30:15.679 --> 00:30:16.640
the entire time

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.159
because they tried and they spent so

00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:19.520
much money on decreasing the national

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.799
debt that just increased it

00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:22.640

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.279
embarrassed of his father yeah like he's

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:40.640

mixed up with nixon too a lot

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.120

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.159
reagan but in this thing the sun's like

00:31:58.159 --> 00:31:59.679
he kind of like trashes his dad the

00:31:59.679 --> 00:32:00.799
whole time that was he really in this

00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:02.480
documentary it seems like like

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.480
he talks about him i mean maybe he had a

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.640
very weird relationship i'm sure he did

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.519
with his dad but at one point ronald

00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:10.880
reagan i guess had told him a story

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.600
about

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.240
growing up when his when ronald reagan's

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.159
dad so this guy's grandpa

was was a drinker and he came back one

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.080

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.279
dad out in the snow

00:32:21.279 --> 00:32:22.799

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.480
like around christmas or something and

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.679

gonna misremember them

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.599
and [ __ ] it up but there was one where

00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:52.000
the

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.240
police officer from dallas was in the

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.359
car with

00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:59.119
fbi or military police and

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:01.200
uh they were leaving the hospital going

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.800
back to the scene or whatever

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.280
and the the fbi agent i guess had given

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.960
him enough information

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.960
that when he got back he wrote a list of

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.160
employees at

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.040
the book depository and the top one was

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.359
harvey lee oswald he got backwards but

00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:16.800
he wrote an address he got the wrong

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.640
address 603

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.560
he wrote down the wrong address on his

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.000
list of where these people are from

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.839
but that was a house that lee rv oswald

00:37:23.839 --> 00:37:25.040
had lived at

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.480
so the guy who just gave him the

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.079
information gave him an old record of

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.520
lee harvey oswald

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.480
he didn't get it from the book

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.599
depository he got it from the military

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:34.720
and then i don't know they crossed the

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.240
reference it was just wild yeah they're

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.680
like this just proves the military the

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.839
government handed this

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:42.320
didn't someone else someone else gets

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.440
shot down there too

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.599
yeah the guy that got like blasted his

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:47.520
cop got shot there was a guy directly

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.200
i think a cop got shot i think a cop got

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.280
murdered there was a guy directly in

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.880
front of jfk that got hit

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.480
but that was the magic bullet it like

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.480
went through jfk's back

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.040
didn't touch bone and then redirected in

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.000
jfk

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.680
to come out of his neck it is so wild

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.960
can this bullet happen to have like a

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.359
eyes and teeth on it too

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.319
and he was explaining to this lady he

00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:43.760
was like i was in madagascar for two

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.559
years trying to

00:47:44.559 --> 00:47:47.119
negotiate with the imf to be like stop

00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:48.640
[ __ ] like just forgive these guys

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.760
loans you loan the money because

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.960
apparently

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.520
these big centralized banks got like a

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.720
huge

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.240
tide of oil money that came out of the

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.079
middle east and so they got like flooded

00:47:58.079 --> 00:47:59.440
with all this money and they're like

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.960
well [ __ ] we have to lend this to

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.319
somebody yeah they just destroyed africa

00:48:02.319 --> 00:48:03.359
through that yeah they're like

00:48:03.359 --> 00:48:04.960
it's [ __ ] pointless so they're like

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.960
they would like either ask the current

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.920
guy like hey

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.200
you guys should take a loan to fix it

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.079
and they'd be like no and they're like

00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:11.280
all right well put another it's like

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.319
what uh

00:48:12.319 --> 00:48:15.200
what china did with the which one

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.640
china's doing it right now they like

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:17.359
lend

00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:18.880
lended a ton of money to all these like

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.200
port cities yeah and then they're like

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.119
if you can't pay it back by this date we

00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:24.480
own the port basically

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.839
and so it's just china just building

00:48:25.839 --> 00:48:27.200
ports so that's that's what that's what

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.400
they did but they were also just like

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.920
they just wanted to get some interest on

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.559
this money so

00:48:30.559 --> 00:48:32.319
they would give a loan this guy was

00:48:32.319 --> 00:48:33.119
telling this lady i was just a

00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:34.960
madagascar it's a [ __ ] mess like they

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.440
they gave

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.640
the loan to these people they paid it

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.920
back it wasn't even like they took it

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.480
out it was like

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.240
like a dictator or big okay and put most

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.599
of it in a swiss bank account

00:48:41.599 --> 00:48:42.720
then there's people who are like we have

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.559
to pay this money back blah blah blah so

00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:45.839
what happened was the government started

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:46.559
they had this like

00:48:46.559 --> 00:48:48.800
program where like they would um

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.760
vaccinate people

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.319
or some kind of thing no no it was like

00:48:52.319 --> 00:48:53.760
jews and vaccines it was mosquito

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.359
control no it was good it was mosquito

00:48:55.359 --> 00:48:56.400
control it was mosquito

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.000
there was no juice well maybe i don't

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.839

00:48:59.839 --> 00:49:00.720
i don't know what i'm saying there could

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.119
have been a couple but the the thing

00:49:03.119 --> 00:49:03.920
that uh

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.520
so they were doing this mosquito program

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.800
where like they did it every so many

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.240
years and it would like inoculate people

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.680
versus like the horrible diseases from

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.880
mosquitoes which actually you know

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.079
better chance of dying from mosquito

00:49:12.079 --> 00:49:13.359
stuff than like a bunch of other stuff

00:49:13.359 --> 00:49:14.559
you think about but

00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:17.040

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.880
snapple fact you actually have a good

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.800
chance of dying from mosquito stuff than

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.079
other stuff

00:49:26.079 --> 00:49:28.640
just saying

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:32.160

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.520
pay back these loans that you know the

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.040

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.520
thing to lady he's like just as soon as

children died

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.599
due to mosquito related deaths that

00:49:41.599 --> 00:49:42.960
would have been preventable if these

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.319
people have just been like

00:49:44.319 --> 00:49:45.839

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.520
you in interest yeah

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.960
here's the mosquito like dude like five

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.040
thousand kids died like i think like

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.559
fifteen like ten thousand adults died

00:49:54.559 --> 00:49:56.079
five thousand children died

00:49:56.079 --> 00:49:57.280
and he was down there like trying to

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.559
negotiate a settlement being like dude

00:49:58.559 --> 00:49:59.760
this is [ __ ] crazy like you're

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.559
[ __ ] these people

00:50:00.559 --> 00:50:02.400
what malaria or what do they get some it

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.599
was some kind of thing for it was

00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:04.640
something [ __ ] up

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.240
so he's explaining this to this lady

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.760
it's long drawn out scenario and she was

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.280
like well

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.720
they borrowed the money they have to pay

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.240
their debts and so this whole idea the

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.520
book's looking into like where does the

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.480
moral obligate

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.000
obligation from like debt come from and

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
how far does it go back and he goes all

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:18.880
the way you know

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.800
all the way back to like the sanskrit

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.640
word for debt is also the same for sin

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.319
and the aramaic word for debt is also

00:50:24.319 --> 00:50:25.680
the same as sin so like it's kind of

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.119
like built into like our whole morality

00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:28.160
systems

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.200
um but the uh

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.440
there was one thing there's a couple but

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.559
you know how you know why like our

00:50:34.559 --> 00:50:36.319
credit cards get like erased every seven

00:50:36.319 --> 00:50:36.880
years

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.119
that's the jubilee that comes from like

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:40.160
ancient

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.359
like hebrew law so what happened was

00:50:43.359 --> 00:50:44.559
you know the hebrews were doing their

00:50:44.559 --> 00:50:46.240
thing wait what gets their reaction what

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.079
the jubilee every seven years your debt

00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:49.359
gets kind of like forgiving you know

00:50:49.359 --> 00:50:50.720
like if you have a credit card and every

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.079
seven years it kind of just like goes

00:50:52.079 --> 00:50:53.680
away i've never had a credit card ever i

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.319
cashed hard

00:50:54.319 --> 00:50:55.760
i cashed in hard my mom told me this

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.359
when i was young so i was like sweet

00:50:57.359 --> 00:50:59.280
so yeah so there was i ca i like just

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.880
lit up a credit card when i was 21 and

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.480
just like i got seven years dude i'll be

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.839
i don't need credit for seven years

00:51:03.839 --> 00:51:06.000
yeah so yeah there's a thing debts i

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.040
think if you're bankrupt too

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.160
there's a certain thing after seven

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.160
years the bankruptcy kind of wipes it's

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.240
there's something kind of to it um but

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.760
where that comes from jubilee

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.200
it's a jubilee year because we have a

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.960
jubilee day in mechanicsburg

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.079
what is that what do you guys do it's

00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:20.240
just a large fair in mechanicsburg

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.400
so we celebrate so what would happen was

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.920
you so back in the day

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.160
you know so the uh you know the hebrews

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.200
were doing their thing and then you know

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:27.839
they were like

00:51:27.839 --> 00:51:29.359
the babylonians the persians would come

00:51:29.359 --> 00:51:30.960
[ __ ] them up so one guy

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.200
used to be kangs he was a jewish dude he

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.640
was a cup bearer for this persian guy

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.960
and he was like dude let me go run

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.559
please let me go run [ __ ] you know

00:51:38.559 --> 00:51:39.839
the holy let me go back and like set the

00:51:39.839 --> 00:51:41.200
temple back up

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.480
and he got this idea i think from the

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.400
babylonians where like you know she

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:44.720
would be

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.079
you know like the babylonian ruler be

00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:47.280
doing their thing like you know you'd

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.720
owe me money blah blah blah

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.480
and then a new rule would come in and

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.839
just be like all right debts are all

00:51:51.839 --> 00:51:52.319
clear

00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:53.359
like that guy owes me money he's like

00:51:53.359 --> 00:51:54.319
that was under that other king that's

00:51:54.319 --> 00:51:55.920
all [ __ ] yeah restart they would do

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.440
resets constantly like this

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.960
so the jays went back to the you know

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.800
jays and he's like yo we got to stop

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.000
crushing each other with this [ __ ]

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.359
man they're like let's just do every

00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:04.800
seven years of [ __ ] resets and you

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.119
know

00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:06.480
you know so that comes from like an

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.240
ancient practice which is pretty wow

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.440

the dude the uh

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.720
because like they also talked about how

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.160

fanatics pretty good

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.280
dude the uh there was another thing too

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.000
from that book

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.160
about how you know a lot of times there

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.200
just wouldn't be enough money to go

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:43.839
around that

00:56:43.839 --> 00:56:44.880
they're like you know we're not there it

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.799
was like physical coins so what they

00:56:46.799 --> 00:56:48.000
would do is take like say

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.680
you know i gave you like you know three

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.920
pigs and you owed me you know three pigs

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.960
or whatever

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.160
we would take we would rip a little

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.559
branch off of a little tree like a twig

00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:58.480
and i would i'd hit like three marks on

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.240
the one end three marks on the other end

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.960
break it in half that um that you would

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.400
call the the end with the thing that's

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.599
owed to it the stock

00:57:05.599 --> 00:57:06.799
and the thing that you have to be called

00:57:06.799 --> 00:57:08.480
the stub that's where stockholm ticket

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.280
stove came from

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.119
wow give you the other half that's where

00:57:11.119 --> 00:57:12.400
the stub came from

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.760
that was like back in the day then you'd

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:14.960
have all these stubs i'm like yeah this

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.160
is this guy he owes me this you could

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.119
trade it to him and they're going

00:57:17.119 --> 00:57:19.040
to sweet that's as good as three pigs

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.480
but the whole premise of the book too oh

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.400
ious for some pigs they talk about that

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.200
they also say that the idea of

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.960
they say uh do you think of wiping out

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.319
college debt

00:57:28.319 --> 00:57:30.559
yeah we would be fine sick you agree

00:57:30.559 --> 00:57:31.440
with it absolutely

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.880
tight i think we could wipe out i mean

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:33.839
that's the point it's like you could

00:57:33.839 --> 00:57:36.960
totally wipe it out and like

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.720
i think we're on like a pure and the

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:39.760
other thing too people we need to go

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.680
back to the gold standard

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.119
we need to i've heard people it's

00:57:43.119 --> 00:57:44.640
money's not even attached to anything

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:44.960
and

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.400
the movie wizard of oz was actually

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.760
about how that caused problems because

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:48.720
there would be

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.280
money would be limited in supply so they

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.200
would trick like farmers into

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.880
the wizard of oz is all about how they

00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.880
were [ __ ] kansas farmers over

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.559
and then giving them loans they couldn't

00:57:58.559 --> 00:58:00.160
repay and then stealing their farms

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.760
so the scarecrow was a farmer who was

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.000
too dumb to like not walk into a stupid

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:04.640
loan

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.480
the tin man was the industrial class who

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.319
didn't have like the the heart to like

00:58:08.319 --> 00:58:09.119
you know help

00:58:09.119 --> 00:58:10.720
or they were like he didn't have the uh

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.400
whatever the [ __ ] he didn't have

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.319
and his was hard it was hard he like

00:58:14.319 --> 00:58:15.520
didn't have a heart to like you know

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.160
whatever

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:18.000
and then wait what was the lines though

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.559
courage lions was the political class

00:58:20.559 --> 00:58:22.240
like the elite who like just sat there

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.839
and just kind of watched it and it's

00:58:23.839 --> 00:58:25.520
like if you you know again wizard of oz

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.160
ounce because

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.839
the guy who there was a guy who was

00:58:27.839 --> 00:58:29.680
running out of gold who wanted to run

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:31.200
uh silver standard too so like they

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.720
could increase the money supply

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.920
then the government was like how about

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.440
we just issue debt and call that money

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.000
everyone's like

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.319
okay whatever we don't know that sounds

00:58:38.319 --> 00:58:39.839
good i like it but yeah dude it goes

00:58:39.839 --> 00:58:41.520
into like adam smith's theories and how

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.720
we're like oh money just came out of

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.160
barter and how they were basically like

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:45.359
this guy's an anthropologist he's like

00:58:45.359 --> 00:58:47.119
we have never seen any societies the old

00:58:47.119 --> 00:58:48.160
invisible hand

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.520
dude well they were talking about no

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.200
words yeah exactly so you were saying

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.240
there's nothing some people should call

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:52.960
the stranger

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.559
you know when you're sitting here when

00:58:54.559 --> 00:58:55.599
you sit on your hand till it falls

00:58:55.599 --> 00:58:56.880
asleep and you jerk off with it

00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.240
what do you want to talk about an old

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.000
adam smith the invisible hand

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.839
the invisible hand control dude this guy

00:59:01.839 --> 00:59:04.079
starts talking about different methods

00:59:04.079 --> 00:59:05.920
that was good no it's stunk i'm just

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.280
excited to talk about this analog

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.200
exchange yeah i'm just i'm struggling go

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.480
ahead no dude you're killing it wait

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.079
come on dude

00:59:12.079 --> 00:59:15.119
no you haven't covered you idiot

00:59:15.119 --> 00:59:16.559
i'm risking my life for this episode

00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:18.799
don't give us a salt lamp dude it'll

00:59:18.799 --> 00:59:20.960
purify itself dude there's this so this

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.559
guy's like going into like trying to

00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:23.760
he's basically saying like you know i'm

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.200
an anthropologist and you know none of

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.559
us can find

00:59:26.559 --> 00:59:28.559
societies where people who live together

00:59:28.559 --> 00:59:30.799
live on barter like hey i got three pigs

00:59:30.799 --> 00:59:32.319
how about you trade me this

00:59:32.319 --> 00:59:35.040
why did just randy dangerfield yeah yeah

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.079
i got three people he's like it's kind

00:59:36.079 --> 00:59:37.119
of a myth he's like you know

00:59:37.119 --> 00:59:38.559
there's sometimes people will barter but

00:59:38.559 --> 00:59:40.079
it's usually after they've been exposed

00:59:40.079 --> 00:59:40.799
to money you know

00:59:40.799 --> 00:59:42.000
it's not something like barter doesn't

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.720
predate money so according to this guy

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.440
but it has to no he said people were

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.200
just on the credit sharing

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.319
but it's different though because that

00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:52.079
was a whole other thing too it's like

00:59:52.079 --> 00:59:52.319
the

00:59:52.319 --> 00:59:55.280
the idea of you know again this guy i'm

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.559
gonna butcher what the [ __ ] he's talking

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:57.599
about but

00:59:57.599 --> 01:00:01.040
he um he was saying how

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.079
like people were like well you know the

01:00:02.079 --> 01:00:03.760
native americans were they they'd have a

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.040
guy in their village who was good at

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.559
this and they just had long houses where

01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:08.000
they just like you need shoes like

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.520
lady go get this yeah they just kept all

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.040
their [ __ ] in the house and like yeah so

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.400
people didn't barter within communities

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.760
but they would they would barter with

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.160
like

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.520
enemies and people they weren't really

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.079
like like strangers so this one

01:00:18.079 --> 01:00:19.599
society he was studying i think it was

01:00:19.599 --> 01:00:21.119
somewhere in brazil it was called the

01:00:21.119 --> 01:00:21.680
zamalog

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.760
exchange so you would grow so you live

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.440
in this area and like it was just taboo

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.880
like you couldn't bone anyone from this

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.240
other area ever like it was just off

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.359
limits weren't allowed to do it

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:30.640
weren't allowed to do anything with them

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.799
yeah but like once a year you guys would

01:00:32.799 --> 01:00:34.240
get like you know say like you guys made

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.760
like some sick ass beers

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.040
they had maybe somehow they got some

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.880
european linens or something

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.760
they'd be like all right we're gonna

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.760
meet for the zamalog exchange where you

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.680
would go and then like say like you me

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.359
[ __ ] nolan lemaire we would all get

01:00:45.359 --> 01:00:46.640
on stage and like start like playing

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.680
like instruments

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.280
and then late like other dudes wives

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.559
would come with like say they had the

01:00:50.559 --> 01:00:51.119
cloths

01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:52.480
they would start like whipping our birds

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.240
with a cloth while we played songs

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.520
and you'd you know you'd finish up and

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.799
then you would they would take you in

01:00:56.799 --> 01:00:58.079

was a whole point it takes the whole

01:02:48.079 --> 01:02:49.440
edge off the situation

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.640

the bathroom

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.480

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:09.359
bunch of checks on

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.960
me that's a good move i think there was

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.720
a cue i think the teacher was like the

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.000
[ __ ] way

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.079

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.680
1963 when the federal government killed

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.170
the president of the united states true

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:23.039
[Laughter]

mars kept calling her kill he's like

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.319
sorry america is no different than a

01:07:26.319 --> 01:07:27.359
banana republic

01:07:27.359 --> 01:07:29.520
where exactly what they tried to say we

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.799

if anybody has ever heard of this

01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:36.400
there's a conspiracy about

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.200
jfk getting killed i i bought it full ed

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.319

fully dude it's crazy

01:07:43.839 --> 01:07:46.000
but yeah man it's uh it's also funny too

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.760
thinking about like how people are like

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.920

that's all right imagine come get it

01:07:54.559 --> 01:07:56.400
imagine lending a money

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.400
lending money to a guy who is like i

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.240

yeah who can also

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.760
control like what money is and how much

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.440
it's worth like that guy owes me a lot

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.319
of money it's like

01:08:08.319 --> 01:08:10.640

nice to him

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.000
yeah but yeah that's kind of that's the

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.119
just wait for him to

01:08:15.119 --> 01:08:18.239
fall apart by slowly poisoning him true

01:08:18.239 --> 01:08:19.679
just poisoning the well discourse

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:22.000
slightly poisoning that giant over time

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.679
yeah but you know you got patriots like

01:08:23.679 --> 01:08:25.679
