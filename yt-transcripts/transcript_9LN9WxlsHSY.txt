while he was getting filmed cuz he was

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.770

gone in a month I'll be in the way of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.830
the best mom you do do draft Bay's

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.780
typically typically stick around or

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.119
those always do they always get cut nine

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.549
times out of ten draft Bay is cut unless

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.400
it's Michael Sam that's like their draft

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.880
night in that case JFK got cut they're

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.560
like they're like am I gonna burn out in

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.909
one season or am I gonna stick around

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.490
like am I gonna get traded early it's

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.689
tough yeah a lot of them get rude

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.340
there's a there's a really iconic photo

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.369
of Russell Wilson's girlfriend one half

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.369
day one of the most horrible pictures of

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.200
all time but yeah she did she got cut in

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.390
the preseason David what a glorious

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.729
level up for him man cuz that that

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.670
mutant she looks like she sells [ __ ]

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.060
life insurance she is young he was at

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.190
Wisconsin yeah yeah I guess that's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.750
that's pretty pretty good for

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.520
Wisconsin's standards I don't know I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.140
feel like any single college on earth

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.800
has

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.400
the hottest matter where it is they're

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.970
[ __ ] hot there's a I I do have an

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.250
actual an actual BAE problem here for

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.370
for the draft but uh this does feel like

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.360
super old fashioned like feudalistic

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.190
like the the man just found out how much

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.070
work how much wealth and worth he's

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.410
gonna generate and then it's like pays

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.920
like well I'm very pretty so this is

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.290
cool right what do we get we're gonna

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.240
exchange that right you've got you've

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.480
got claim over a but as long as you want

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.280
it and then you're what you'll bring

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.720
what are you bring it at a table aside

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.100
from forty million dollars though for

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.140
over the next five years I think yeah

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.400
that's that's probably how it used to be

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.440
except it was like cattle and not just

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.950
but on her end will do just just seeing

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.290
how like seedy lamps girlfriend acted

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.840
and what that one specific moment you

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.300
clearly smell a [ __ ] OJ situation

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.230
coming down the pike oh yeah it really

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.180
it really does it really does

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.780
you know lightens hojae's burden of

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.030
guilt here cuz you see that you see what

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.730
he's dealing with it yeah you get a live

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.390
look at [ __ ] draft base the more

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.460
transparency you have them the better oj

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.290

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.670
closer to Oh Jay just having the slate

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.740

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.200
Twitter it's Twitter is so [ __ ] funny

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.750
now we need now we need the rest of the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.030
the footage for Ray Rice so he can be

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.390
vindicated as well cuz who knows what

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.930
she was up to

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.380
she caught one with her like he had to

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.520
have given him like a wedgie on an

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.750
escalator or something to bring that

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.790
about man that's well she was charging

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.070
Ray Rice his girlfriend used to charge

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.100
and it was ineffective

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.340
Ray Rice used punch it's super punch to

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.070
face did you guys see the Deadspin

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.460
article

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.580
it was misogyny was taken early in first

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.050
trip for a first round of NFL Draft

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.460
any any guess what that means just go

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.220
ahead she throw it out there because I

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.020
had fun with this I this morning I saw

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.970
that headline I was like what could have

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.800
possibly happen my first guess was that

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.510
some oh I think I know and in their

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.100
living room someone was like twerking

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.540
behind them and that was like and then

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.040
they started throwing money out I was

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.390
like that that was like alright they

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.590
probably thought it was funny this is

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.360
just they're purposely taking this out

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.230
of context okay what do you think it was

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.420
it was the fact that we ignored the WNBA

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.170
Draft [ __ ] yeah and then I got

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.730
angrier when I found out I was like well

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.200
this we can't let that stand

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.860
no siree they tried to get Adam Schefter

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.960
on it Adam Schefter was like it's

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.760
finally it's so good at [ __ ] sports

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.340
back and [ __ ] dudes from like Vox

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.540
were like actually yeah sports we're

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.900
back it's so funny that I was the I'm so

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.860
glad that you started with home actually

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.270
because as soon as I saw this I was like

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.730
oh my god now these people are the

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.240
actually like the the actual meme that

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.090
spitting misspelled actually yeah go

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.470
ahead sorry could you double check your

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.820
audio real quick cuz you kind of sound

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.260

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.080
[Music]

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.950
like you're yelling through a pillow so

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.300
yeah that's typically when you say

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.240
versus things but dude one of the things

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.680
that I was most bummed about seeing that

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.080
um seeing the draft last night was one

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.550
of the highlights is always how good

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.290
Roger Goodell is at the black handshake

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.590
oh dude he's like one of those [ __ ]

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.810
Harvard robots given that handshake yeah

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.620
it's really cool it's uh it's fun to see

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.930
them and here's one we skipped that it

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.680
was my favorite was a couple years ago

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.230
when the draft was in Philly the protest

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.310
there was like a bunch of Christian

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.780
protestors like God hates [ __ ]

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.160
interested hey which is what I went

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.870
onstage that night it good good I got

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.550
trouble for this I was like I went to

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.830
with the first pick of the NFL Draft

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.770
hell selects [ __ ] before Matt it's like

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.169

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.889
[ __ ] but loves the Clippers

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.069
that's that's your issue Shane what's a

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.870
bit of a job you nailed them so hard

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.819
that they can't just it's like you just

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.580
look like a target to them well yeah it

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.680
looks like I don't know maybe I maybe I

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.919
my satire is so good that I am that mmm

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:58.419
I would they like wait a second are you

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:00.639
one of them that's that's the obvious

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.060
thing but maybe there's a part of them

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.530
that's like I wish I nailed them that

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.349
hard I wish I was as hard said my

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:13.449
lame-ass Kofi tweets about it this guy

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:15.099

yeah that's the NFL Draft is I'm trying

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:24.610
to think of what other misogyny there

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.029
was just forgetting about the WNBA Draft

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:31.419

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:00.069
[ __ ] not to be a dick head cuz it

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:01.389
maybe some of them are very qualified

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:03.729
but it's like you know they probably

00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:06.460

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.070
there was on that one chick that played

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.050
in Tampa Bay Lightning mine earlier

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.060

I don't remember anything about her play

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.390
but I just remembered that she got in

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.470
the game and it was a big deal like she

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.390
was pretty attractive to well like

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.650
I would like to go back and look at tape

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.950
just to see like how good she was I I'm

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.080
sure she got [ __ ] lit up cuz

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.060
otherwise they would have [ __ ] they

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.760
would have brought her in do you know

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.650
how good of a look that is I mean like

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.060
they're trying to experiment with like

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.740
female kickers and they can't they just

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.590
aren't it's not like I can't do anything

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.440
I'm not saying I'm athletic but like I

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.390
could beat the [ __ ] out of most women

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.780
but

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.570
I would just I would be dry I would have

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.910
been drafted in the WNBA I would have

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.110
been a project but I would have been

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.450
drafted at what point are your playing

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.190

named Wanderlei Silva and he he's

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.660
already talking about donating his brain

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.460
he's like for first of all he's 42 years

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.890
old I thought he was like 60 and he's

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.360
like less than ten years older than me

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.910

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.460
those guys I was just watching Luke

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.820
Rockhold uh first Bisping and then

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.310
knockouts are just like like when they

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.810
just just when they're hitting them

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.760
after the fact it's like holy [ __ ] dude

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:19.089
hold on steroids and lost his

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:21.639
I over it I think that would I would

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:23.050
wake up every day I that's how do you

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.730
not end up an alcoholic in a movie that

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.129
has to that fast-forwards your life 20

00:13:27.129 --> 00:13:28.600
years you've got nothing left you wake

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.249
up you drink out of a bottle and he's

00:13:30.249 --> 00:13:31.269
just I don't know he seems to have a

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:32.379
pretty good attitude about it

00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:34.300
yeah Bisping seems like the man I've

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.620
never I've never encountered him but he

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.689
does that podcast with Louis so must be

00:13:37.689 --> 00:13:39.939
I yeah he takes that [ __ ] eye out

00:13:39.939 --> 00:13:42.459
every once in a while he always tells it

00:13:42.459 --> 00:13:43.839
no he's told the story a couple times

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:45.339
about how he would wear sunglasses to

00:13:45.339 --> 00:13:46.899
his doctor's appointments to trick the

00:13:46.899 --> 00:13:48.309
doctors because if they saw you had one

00:13:48.309 --> 00:13:48.459
eye

00:13:48.459 --> 00:13:50.199
they'd be like we can't certify you for

00:13:50.199 --> 00:13:53.529
the fight and apparently hired he was

00:13:53.529 --> 00:13:55.300
like by the way I only have one eye and

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.649
there was like yeah we [ __ ] know you

00:13:56.649 --> 00:14:00.339
didn't Rick for the only good of doctors

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:01.809
who practice medicine on the beach at

00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:05.709
[ __ ] Jamaica doctors that were

00:14:05.709 --> 00:14:07.930
[ __ ] guaranteeing millions of dollars

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.559
coming in that weekend I saw something

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:12.519
this week that I totally forgot about

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:13.899
that really made me laugh all over again

00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:16.449
but remember when um draymond Green was

00:14:16.449 --> 00:14:18.430
talking [ __ ] about Conor McGregor about

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.749
how Floyd Mayweather was gonna whip his

00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:23.259
ass yeah McGregor said he said something

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:25.179
like listen boy I dribble heads off the

00:14:25.179 --> 00:14:31.059
canvas I don't dribble basketballs maybe

00:14:31.059 --> 00:14:36.160
the best of all time it did suck to see

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.749
everybody be like mayweather is gonna

00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:39.790
[ __ ] him up and it's like yeah obviously

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.040
but if you know if they've met each

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.319
other in an alley mcgregor would

00:14:44.319 --> 00:14:46.809
literally murder him yeah that's weird

00:14:46.809 --> 00:14:48.009
it's a weird thing they would have to

00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:50.019
box when you could kill somebody well

00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:52.089
until until MMA came out boxing was

00:14:52.089 --> 00:14:53.889
fighting to almost everybody in the

00:14:53.889 --> 00:14:55.660
world and it still it kind of is like

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.829
when you see street fight they're like

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:59.290
don't kick get up thought up light them

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.290
up off the ground and every every other

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.660
dude that's like when you see street

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.249
fights now on the internet everyone

00:15:06.249 --> 00:15:08.019
knows a little bit about MMA now like

00:15:08.019 --> 00:15:10.120
you see you see some blood kicks see

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.379
some blood kicks getting adopted yeah no

00:15:14.379 --> 00:15:16.749
no don't do that this is about who

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.459
punches the hardest and who has a shirt

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:21.490
off first no skills please notice

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:22.660
there's a lot of double leg takedown

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.449
snow that's a big thing that I wish they

00:15:25.449 --> 00:15:27.040
didn't know about yeah well I think

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.850
every day

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.380
are you see the world triathletes evolve

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.060
every May with white guys equalizer for

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.620
world star that was the what we got

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.510
that's how i MMA got so popular was

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.190
white guys watching it watching world

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.180
saw and be like this can't happen to me

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.710
it's always a white guy going to sleep

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.280
and it's the scariest thing in the world

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.520
your pants ripped off it knocked out and

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:10.170
they just ripped like a learn how to do

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.680
an armbar I think we're losing the that

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.060
final head kick when they're on the

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.740
ground where it's like the fights kind

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.270
of over and the guys like on his hands

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.820
and knees and there's one soccer K just

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.470
collapses and this makes a big thud on

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.060
the ground that that kind of a dying art

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.910
I want their good cuz that one I hated

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.320
watching that one it makes me

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.360
uncomfortable every time it's so bad

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.970

community pretty hard dude so I agree

with Shane you should get the antibodies

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.470
test only though you would probably call

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.410
it an LT bodies test but do it for your

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.790
sake of for your family's sake man you

really need the short things up there

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.630
yeah it is it now it's pretty hard it's

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.550
not genetic though it's just because me

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.200
and my people we keep hanging out on

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.450
front steps and groups of like 10 to 15

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.820
and the entire time you can hear

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.680
reggaeton coming through the double pane

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.110
windows in front of my house through the

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.110

[ __ ] doctors from North Philly yeah I

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.730
gotta get out of here but like one of

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.350
the coolest social distancing violations

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.030
I've seen was when I came over to your

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.100
house when all this first started is

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.170
every dude that was on that stoop had

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.500
gloves on that was matching their outfit

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:08.480
rubber gloves on try an yeah it is funny

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.100
to see people take precautions that

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.750
literally otherwise their entire lives

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.510

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.570
cold or the flu you know I'll do some

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.470
Facebook that was like stop throwing

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.000
your [ __ ] gloves on the ground you're

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.380
not a [ __ ] doctor you're a dirt ball

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.910
or something like that yeah and first

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.370
for like this much of a second I was

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.980
like yeah but then I remembered I step

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.110
over discarded condoms every single time

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.330
I leave my house yeah the gloves are

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.280
pretty shitty but I can't believe people

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.420
still use condoms

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.800
I was like I like to walk around my

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.600
neighborhood and like on any given night

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.370
there's a park right by my house like

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.200
you'll see condoms from kids [ __ ] in

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:55.040
the park those things I go get do when I

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.600
first started banging my wife like I was

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.490
like trying to act like like I was a

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.350
normal being so like I would use them

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.060
but then I didn't I didn't want to leave

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.530
it in her grandfather's trash can so

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.610
like I would just like throw it out in

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.080
the front yard so gonna mean God knows

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.550
how many [ __ ] used condoms that old

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.550
man had to come across from letting me

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:14.480
hang out at this [ __ ] place yeah the

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.770
funniest reveal would be that she didn't

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:20.830
live it as a para grandfather overthrow

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.110

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:25.790
my kids in the next room so I gotta be

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.920
careful I let us say this but uh the

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.530
time where I felt the most confident was

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.180
when I brought her back to her

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.410
grandfather's house for the first time

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.830
we were laying on her living room floor

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.780

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.610

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.730
isolated I was like a town of like five

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:51.240
thousand people maybe but what's the

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.160
food situation look like you guys you

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.590
just eat more girl yeah yeah yeah it's

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.230
not bad I went to Taco Bell last night

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:03.870
that was big yes out of the city

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:07.020
everything's fine not fine you know what

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.990
I mean but like it's not as [ __ ]

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.030
chaotic I'm sure like people are still

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.680
social distancing and wearing gloves and

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.750
[ __ ] and a mask into the gas station but

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.120
it's it's chill I'm not I'm not as

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.660
worried here yeah or the prostitutes

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.660
around there I don't know I haven't I

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.560
I'm not I'm not a prostitute guy oh man

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.470
never never was I I don't know you know

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:32.730
it's it's funny like somebody put up

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.410
there was a chick that that's spit into

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.830
the face of two Italian specialty shop

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.080
employees in Philly recently and they

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.090
found out that she was a prostitute on

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:44.160
this one this website where they have

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.770
her prices listed and I was shocked at

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.720
how cheaply you could get a prostitute

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.160
for these days and a high-end wanted

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.850
that too how much reliant look at her

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.530
man you saw her she was very attractive

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:57.510
she was well put together and you could

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.640
get it was abbreviated Schoen it was

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.790
like what was that Tim it was like QV

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.260
which I assume stood for quick visit

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.500
like that was like 125 bucks you can get

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.650
a half hour for 175 and a full hour for

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.410
250 Wow

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.630
my only frame of comparison was from

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.100
going to washee-washee where that was

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.800
like I think that was like 160 and that

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.930
was like late 90s how long how long have

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:24.570
a visit was that pretty quick mate cuz I

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.100
would don't really go on weekends and

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.930
like they were they were getting him in

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.400
and out and one time I wasn't there for

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.750
this but the guy that I would normally

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.700
go with he said one time he went there

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.700
and a member from the Eagles second area

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.120
was there

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.920
yelled at his name dude where the [ __ ]

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.060
do you think we are but it's normally

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.200
packed and they try to get you in and

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.030
out as quickly as possibly just laid you

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.620
down on a conveyor belt and she's just

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.260
walked by jerking you off just ran back

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.850
around in the front just started the

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:52.980
next guy dude it's not that far off from

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.240
that because the way it would go was

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.740
like you would get in there and they

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.150
would sit you down in this waiting room

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.680
and they would bring you a little bud

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.530
nip it was like a [ __ ] I think was

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.570
like eight ounce beer maybe and you

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:04.680
would sit there you would drink it and

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.880
then they would call you back and it's

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.260
like when it was so busy you wouldn't

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.250
even get to pick who you wanted to be

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:09.660
with and they would just bring you back

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.640
to the room lay you down on a massage

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.650
table and they had this gigantic tub of

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.810
boiling hot water and they had like a

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.660
[ __ ] a cow brush and they would

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.430
[ __ ] dump this water on you and brush

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.960
you down with the cow brush and then

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.630
send you to a specific room Jesus Christ

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.790
enjoyable music I went to a whorehouse

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.870
in London and they were mean I didn't

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:35.700
like it I'm not a prostitute guy I

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.920
actually hated being there it's a

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.890

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:02.280
in character in this room with like

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.010
probably like 20 women and it was just

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.270
me and O'Connor on one side of the room

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.670

100% hanging out with the staff well

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.760
there were other things involved

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:30.950
desert yeah could yeah I could picture

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:32.540
myself living here for sure it's a once

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.840
once stand-ups done I'd I think I'm not

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.690
gonna live in a city and the desert it's

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.160
[ __ ] awesome

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.470
it is cool down in Arizona it's

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:43.730
terrifying like one of the best things

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.380
about the desert are the people that

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.780
live around there like everybody that

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.100
lives in a desert town looks like

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.530
they're escaping a murder from their

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:52.320
hometown

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.480
they are all very shitty people they're

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.180
all leather skin tain't they all look

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.670
like they do meth they're very shitty

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.530
but I mean desert people are shitty

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:02.730
people yeah

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:03.870
so I kind of like it they're all nice

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:05.220
[ __ ] they're all kind of like hippies

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.190
it's very hippie ish and then you run

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:12.770
into the meth ones and they're not nice

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.610
do you think you're gonna venture down

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.750
to Mexico at all not doing this but

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.940
someday no I don't think is it even

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:25.320
legal now I don't know I don't know if

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.700
you ever noticed this about me but I'm

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.200
not a guy that typically plays by the

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.050
rules so I would relations about going

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.550
there you are a very good bad boy

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:35.370
there's a so that sort of cutting off

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:36.780
immigration completely right you can't

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.180
immigrate at all I think so but I don't

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.220
know I'm sure I don't know I don't know

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.110
anything I haven't known one [ __ ]

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.970
thing since you started not read and I

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.670
literally I haven't known one thing yeah

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.890
well I'm just going by what people get

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:52.590
angry about and I just I just look upon

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.080
them and it makes me sad to see the way

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.250
that these people are troubling

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.390
themselves you know what I mean just

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.160
choosing to be upset all the time by

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.950
everything they read yeah she's not a

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.500
weight so it's very funny to look at no

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.660
matter what the way the media does it is

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.080
they have to make it an outrage yeah

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.360
like every single piece of news is like

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.310
this is this is the end of the world

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.050
so he does [ __ ] up well they don't even

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:17.580
have to do it cuz they've already got

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.630
people to the point where they're ready

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.450
they're ready to do it for themselves

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:23.310
like they've been groomed into it now

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:24.510
the news is just like we don't have to

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.220
do anything we could just show it to

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.540
them and they'll they'll do it for

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.370
themselves

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.990
like at this point the news would almost

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:32.460
be better if they were like this is

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.180
stupid

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.070
do you guys know that right but they

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.200
just here's exactly what happened and

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:43.740
everyone's like hopes Stanhope's doing

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.100
this 30 days without news thing and I

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.690
was like when you're done the only news

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:51.360
you should watch is Alex Jones on the

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.480
you [ __ ] and it's like yeah yeah I

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.490
guess yeah I have a different reaction

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:16.109

00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:17.550

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.350
what are you talking about of course I

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.899
am I just finding out in the past like

00:34:21.899 --> 00:34:23.850
year and a half that I am [ __ ] has

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:25.859
changed everything for me and Shane I

00:34:25.859 --> 00:34:27.389
got a credit for this because I feel

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:29.580
like you stopped giving a [ __ ] about all

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.179
this stuff way before me and I'm I envy

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:35.570
you for completely detached

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.590
detaching from what for politics and all

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:39.510
that yeah like you being able on

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.710
election night 2016 is man well that was

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.980
funny that was funny but as here's the

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.080
thing if I was not surrounded by people

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.540
crying it wouldn't have been that funny

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.859
it there would have been a part of me

00:34:52.859 --> 00:34:54.810
that's like well this is kind of a real

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.700
embarrassment for the United States but

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.100
uh what's more funny is seeing all the

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.410
people that are [ __ ] crying about a

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:02.940
presidential like thats a bigger

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.580
embarrassment that is that's more of an

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.290
embarrassment but it took me so much to

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.090
realize that white people crying in the

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:13.400
streets about like we elected a racist

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.720
well even more embarrassing now is where

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.609
people still care about it yeah like

00:35:17.609 --> 00:35:19.650
people are still tweeting about the same

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:19.970
[ __ ]

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:21.020
they were tweeting about and honestly

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.220
like I was one of those people like a

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.410
bit until about a year into the [ __ ]

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.450
presidency I was somebody who was

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.010
complaining non-stop on [ __ ] Facebook

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.470
and then it was just like all right I

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.090
look like a gigantic [ __ ] [ __ ] this

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.710
needs to stop yeah it's tough it's tough

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:35.630
and II you know I was just talking about

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.540
it O'Connor because some dude I'm not

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.280
gonna name him was just talking [ __ ] on

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.180
me and on Twitter and he's one of those

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.980
guys that just has been tweeting about

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:49.520
the president for four years now every

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:53.000
day like one guy no no no this is a

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.520
national guy and it's just it's like

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.030
non-stop

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.619
you're literally tweeting about the

00:35:57.619 --> 00:35:59.240
president every single dislike dude you

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.990
look like a [ __ ] loser yeah anyway no

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:04.520
I mean it's like we get it you're on the

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.440
right side is that what you want is that

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.820
what you want to know you're on the

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.050
right side of history because you

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:10.970
tweeted that the president's like got a

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:14.150
small dick yeah a nice dude

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.160
I think one thing that's keeping those

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.770
people going is how smart that they want

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:22.190
how smart they want to feel like they

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:27.859
have nothing to reinstall how smart they

00:36:27.859 --> 00:36:28.040
are

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.560
or worse and now there's just nothing to

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.230
give them that feedback aside from like

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.089
that they throw that thing out there and

00:36:35.089 --> 00:36:36.530
then people were like this guy's got it

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:39.530
and with that if they stopped doing that

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:40.550
then they'd have to develop a

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.580
personality and it just yeah if they

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.349
even if they even give that thought a

00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:47.390
glance it's like oh it's like looking

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.920
into a witch's eye and seeing how your

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:57.020
death goes it's it all is gay it's kind

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.599
of the the real and and the dudes that

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:02.390
are out rallying with guns in front of

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:06.080
the State Capitol you suck too they've

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:10.160
always done that I think oh yeah there's

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.359
always been fat protesters with guns

00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:19.010
they do rule though that dude with the

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.619
[ __ ] like Avengers mask on and an

00:37:21.619 --> 00:37:26.170
ar-15 you have all that gear

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:27.760
right and you're like man it'd be so

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.349
cool for like there was a reason I got

00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:31.150
to put on all the [ __ ] cartoon gear

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.650
and it's like oh there's a rally and

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.730
they're like really

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.829
and then they suit up dude when they

00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:37.599
when they pull that last strap tight

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:39.760
could you imagine you've never did

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.380
unless your life that makes you feel the

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.849
way they feel when that last velcro

00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:45.160
strap goes across the chest it imagine

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.900
being a fairy tart being able to get

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.640
away with pointing an ar-15 at a nurse

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:52.359
right now oh my god I'm hard even just

00:37:52.359 --> 00:37:56.980
saying that sense that [ __ ] McKeever

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:04.150
tweet about like snake-charming there's

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:05.890
also I mean there's also videos of these

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:08.160
these people dressed in nurse scrubs

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.970
just standing in front of these

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:11.769
protesters for like one second and

00:38:11.769 --> 00:38:13.390
taking a picture and then keep walking

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:15.940
it's like so that it's everybody's just

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.730
being such [ __ ] children about

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:21.339
everything we do it's like it's like

00:38:21.339 --> 00:38:23.049
kind of like I mean Charlottesville is

00:38:23.049 --> 00:38:24.069
not the best example but it's

00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:26.079
Charlottesville or any of these protests

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:29.650
it's like 70 percent people with cameras

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:32.799
yeah 30 percent actual protesters it's

00:38:32.799 --> 00:38:34.630
just a media [ __ ] it's it's

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.460
ridiculous yeah they were society

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.930
opinions influencers that's all they

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:39.940
want to be that's great these other

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.250
people have cool opinions this is the

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:43.750
perfect time for people to reveal just

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:46.269
how uninteresting they are like you

00:38:46.269 --> 00:38:47.410
could literally do anything with your

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:48.640
[ __ ] time right now because most

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.170
people have more time than they

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:51.490
typically do on their hands through

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.559
either if you're [ __ ] laid off or if

00:38:53.559 --> 00:38:55.299
you're just forced to work from home or

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:56.740
whatever reason but it's now it's like I

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.869
don't get how people can be bored right

00:38:58.869 --> 00:39:01.359
now and not only be bored but but harp

00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:03.759
on [ __ ] have [ __ ] to harp on like yeah

00:39:03.759 --> 00:39:05.470
you have a little bit time to if you got

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.059
an internet connection you could watch

00:39:07.059 --> 00:39:08.049
whatever you want you could read

00:39:08.049 --> 00:39:09.190
whatever you want you could connect with

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:10.750
whoever you want and you choose to

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.609
[ __ ] complain about [ __ ] yeah but

00:39:12.609 --> 00:39:14.410
what if reading sucks and you don't have

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.029
any friends and you've sivir seen

00:39:16.029 --> 00:39:18.759
everything so now you got to complain

00:39:18.759 --> 00:39:20.049
that's it

00:39:20.049 --> 00:39:22.029
I support the I support the complainers

00:39:22.029 --> 00:39:23.799
as well in that in that department I

00:39:23.799 --> 00:39:25.569
understand this being boring I'm like

00:39:25.569 --> 00:39:27.160
doing one of the cooler things I've ever

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:31.240
done and I'm still like dis sucks but

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.559
that's just that's just a me problem

00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:37.509
yeah hold on a second weird how Shane

00:39:37.509 --> 00:39:39.480
finishes that with that's a me prob

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.920
instead of just going on the internet

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.880
and whining no no no this is a problem

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.859
with the system I'm bored right now this

00:39:46.859 --> 00:39:49.859

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.510
after the [ __ ] um after the [ __ ]

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.280
presidential assassination when Lyndon

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.720
Johnson was sworn in he was wearing a

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.770
Kennedy strong t-shirt

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:06.930

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.560
anybody except for everyone who doesn't

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.440
respect nurses enough it sucks

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.090

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:31.590
blaming the Chinese people thing will

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:33.210
catch on after that's all over maybe

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:34.230

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.810
Chinese versus is a guaranteed end of

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.760
the world if you think General Tso's

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.560
chicken or something way to get a load

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.390
of General Tso's [ __ ] firepower

00:44:54.390 --> 00:45:00.600
I haven't had I haven't had Chinese food

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.220
in a while in fact it's funny this is

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.350
something that actually happened after

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:05.760
the SNL thing I like stopped eating

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.160
Chinese food out of protest or a fear

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.950
out of like I felt I don't know it was

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:11.820
weird dude

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.280

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.610
weren't too many like actual lasting

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:19.380
things that happened from the S&L thing

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.240
but I just felt bad going into Chinese

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.500

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.070
the last sets I did I made a black guy

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:40.890
run out of the room and they were

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:42.890
filming it and I was like you have to

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:46.440
please tell me somebody got this the

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.700
white people didn't like the joke that

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.349
much I think I was like defending Harvey

00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:54.450
Weinstein just sprinted out of the room

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:56.280
and I was like you don't understand what

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.800
that means as a comic shame you're get

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.030
to a point now where you could probably

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.710
make these kind of accommodations happen

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:03.450
for yourself but start through a black

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:05.670
rooms again but give everyone a Fitbit

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:09.170
to wear and then at the end of the night

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.420
[Laughter]

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:14.430
I don't know I haven't done black rooms

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:16.980
in long enough I might have lost I lost

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.230
my edge there dude go back no way and

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:21.869
that's the LAT way I did warm daddies i

00:50:21.869 --> 00:50:23.670
bombed it warm daddy's a couple times

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:25.530
that's a tough one that's the toughest

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:28.290
black room in Philly as far as you know

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:30.390
the rest of are usually like hey there

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:32.820
do they know buffet that's high-end

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.190
stuff the food's really [ __ ] good so

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:38.190
people are just like you have a 1-second

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:39.960
you have probably like a 20-second

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.910
window at the beginning of your set to

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:44.250
win them because I was the literally

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.140
we'll just go back to eating not like in

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:48.960
a mean way but they will just they're

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.570
just not listening good and I've had

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:54.060
I've had a couple sets where I've just

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.740
performed to a room full of people

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.170
eating dude when you do a special and in

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:03.390
a black room know it's a good idea be

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:05.670
incredible I should have a B side of me

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:08.880
at a black room oh my god it's true we

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.650
have run the same set and at a black

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:13.020
room like obviously lower direction but

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.660
how I would I was like God did just do

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.100
it for me I would enjoy that so [ __ ]

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:21.360
yeah yeah yeah I don't know I lost it

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.580
dude I haven't done it it's that's it

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.340
that's this very particular muscle you

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:27.510
have to work to be able to do those

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:30.000
rooms well without totally selling out

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.010
yourself because you can do well as a

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:33.930
honky especially if you go up there and

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:35.940
I like yo what's it like you start

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.910
talking but like see that too which is

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:40.680
fun to watch I'll tell you what Shane

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.150
put your toe in the water and start with

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:47.580
Puerto Rican audiences there's a couple

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.620
places in New York I can get it done get

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:51.980
going again

00:51:56.090 --> 00:52:01.290
March 12th okay not that long ago

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:04.410
so dude I after a lockdown started I've

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:08.940
done it every day for the less like to

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:09.960
you like this is crazy

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.520
to take this much time off do you feels

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.170
very weird do you miss it or do you feel

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:15.630
like I wasn't a welcome break no I miss

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:18.000
it a lot I miss it a lot there was yeah

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.580
there's no part of me that that is happy

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.780
about it the only thing I'm happy about

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.490
us other people aren't doing it as well

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.950
like if I you know if I have to break

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:28.470
into other people yeah yeah I've done

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:32.340
that before yeah I don't know there's a

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.530
and I can't write either the only way I

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:36.930
can write is like talking on a podcast

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:39.030
and then doing standing up that night

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:41.010
and saying a bit on like writing on

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:42.510
stages is what it's called if you want

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:45.900
to be taught about it but now I'm just

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.220
going back and trying to remember bits

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:50.220
from man shane's that I think are like

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:52.410
right now I'm working yeah I know one

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:53.970
that's gonna be a hit it's gonna be a

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:57.210
banger it's uh we talked about it I was

00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:57.930
talking about how like

00:52:57.930 --> 00:52:59.670
volleyball shorts are [ __ ] gross on

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:01.920
for some reason we put volleyball some

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.319
like middle school kids yeah yeah yeah

00:53:04.319 --> 00:53:05.700
I've heard this come on man and I was

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.440
like I know how this the reason it's

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.930
wrong is because we don't put Special

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:12.569
Olympians we know it's wrong I remember

00:53:12.569 --> 00:53:15.390
hearing this we know it's gross and we

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:17.069
keep it on kids because it's hot and

00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:18.150
then as soon as it's [ __ ] people

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:21.119
we're like well I don't need to see

00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:23.430
their ass like we need to see the kids s

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:25.530
anyway that's a big bit I'm working on

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:28.650
that yeah it's gonna be a banger miles I

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:30.329
think my entire special right now would

00:53:30.329 --> 00:53:34.170
be Special Olympics jokes pretty much

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:37.290
all my best material about coaching just

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:39.210
beautiful man yeah it was fine I

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:41.790
actually coached if we did like a horse

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:43.740
tournament and there was a kid there's

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.780
one kid named hot sauce he wore like a

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:48.750
full Allen Iverson uniform including the

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:50.910
sleeve and they're like remember like

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:52.559
the finger wristbands Allen Iverson

00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:53.990
would wear hmm

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:56.130
his name was hot sauce he was showing

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:57.809
off for the Hooters waitresses the other

00:53:57.809 --> 00:54:00.450
boys did not like that hot sauce got a

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:01.890
lot of flack from the other boys they're

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:02.309
jealous

00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:04.530
it didn't kid named Danny who there was

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:06.180
a horse competition and he took this

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:08.099
same shot every single time and missed

00:54:08.099 --> 00:54:12.000
it after every single time he would go I

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.260
hate that shot pretty fun you just shoot

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.660
a jumper from the elbow slam it against

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:20.130
the backboard I mean I can [ __ ] hate

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:25.470
that shot get the ball do it again it's

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:26.910
fun

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:30.319
it's mighty working with those kids

00:54:30.319 --> 00:54:34.290
right yeah you know what for the longest

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:36.390
time like I was like knee-deep in that

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:37.619
game like now like I've kind of

00:54:37.619 --> 00:54:39.030
gravitated toward like a different

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:43.049
aspect of that and it's not as like it's

00:54:43.049 --> 00:54:45.270
more like higher functioning people okay

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:46.859
but like I have been in like situations

00:54:46.859 --> 00:54:48.270
like I talked about it on something we

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:49.500
did earlier this week we're like I

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:52.109
worked at a summer camp where I was

00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:53.520
putting something together and during a

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.410
dance party a kid came up and just

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:57.059
started [ __ ] grinding me hard from

00:54:57.059 --> 00:54:58.799
the back and I couldn't get him to stop

00:54:58.799 --> 00:55:01.079
and everybody saw it and everybody

00:55:01.079 --> 00:55:02.309
laughed and it was so I was so

00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:03.359
embarrassed that I didn't go back to the

00:55:03.359 --> 00:55:06.329
next day dagger bees do you review that

00:55:06.329 --> 00:55:10.349
story yeah do Gerdes story the

00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:11.700
basketball court by

they get you dude they'll get you they

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:18.480
will but I thought they thought I was

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.740
one of them so they didn't get it was

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:22.320
like it's like at the end of I am Legend

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.150
when they're World War Z when he just

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:26.609
walks through the zombies that's how I

00:55:26.609 --> 00:55:31.230
was with the Special Olympians what are

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:32.849
the great things about about Special

00:55:32.849 --> 00:55:34.950
Olympians is like they all know that

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:36.960

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.020
the egos of NFL wide receivers across

talking [ __ ] to people and I'm yeah

00:58:21.569 --> 00:58:22.890
starting to accept it

00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:27.240
Sam you're like a cool shooter I might

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.470
to do regular school shooter to be

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:29.759
honest with you Mike that's where I'm

00:58:29.759 --> 00:58:31.650
going with this I'm realizing more and

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:34.289
more Who I am but yeah it [ __ ] rules

00:58:34.289 --> 00:58:38.480
like I don't know I we've we've got I'm

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.739
exposed to a bunch of people who aren't

00:58:40.739 --> 00:58:43.710
[ __ ] dorks so I feel like I have an

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:46.140
opportunity to like show them weird cool

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:47.640
video game [ __ ] that they wouldn't

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.369
otherwise see while also you know

00:58:49.369 --> 00:58:53.190
probably being a funny person relatively

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:57.059
on that website but I gotta tell you it

00:58:57.059 --> 00:58:58.440
seems like it's a lot funnier when the

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.569
chain just drops in loaded and starts

00:59:00.569 --> 00:59:03.960
calling me a [ __ ] date I was drunk

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.660
and then I'd be like I [ __ ] this I'm out

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:08.249
and there's literally three minutes

00:59:08.249 --> 00:59:09.720
later I'd be like guy this is boring I'm

00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:13.739
back alright here's here's why that

00:59:13.739 --> 00:59:16.589
troubled me so much I was playing a

00:59:16.589 --> 00:59:18.359
brand new video game that was based on a

00:59:18.359 --> 00:59:19.859
video game I never played before and

00:59:19.859 --> 00:59:21.660
it's very competitive and the people

00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:24.180
that play it are extremely mean even

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.559
your teammates they're like you know the

00:59:25.559 --> 00:59:27.989

00:59:34.559 --> 00:59:36.450

[Laughter]

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.300

that's freezer

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:52.140

so Mohammed retweeted my stand-up and I

01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:07.260
was like dude a Hamid has more balls

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.550
than you you're worried about the

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:10.290
industry thinking you and me are friends

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:13.310
and then I kept hitting meki with like

01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:18.359
300 from the movie like gifts and about

01:02:18.359 --> 01:02:20.849
how like in Greece it was like a real

01:02:20.849 --> 01:02:22.349
insult to tell somebody like oh you'll

01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:23.099
live forever

01:02:23.099 --> 01:02:25.349
so I just kept telling meki like dude

01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:28.109
live forever dude never die honorably

01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.800
dude

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.150
live forever hopefully you get that

01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:33.270
Comedy Central show you're so afraid of

01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:37.980
by associating with me yeah well I mean

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.410
yeah it's effectively ended my stand-up

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:42.480
career in Philadelphia just by being

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.950
yourself and yeah being friends with me

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:46.950
and now I don't know if you know this we

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:49.800
are you guys could all go back and be

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.930
the best people would stand up in in the

01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:54.599
city and everybody yeah you can do

01:02:54.599 --> 01:02:57.839
stand-up it in Philly yeah probably but

01:02:57.839 --> 01:03:00.119
I lost all my fake friends dude all the

01:03:00.119 --> 01:03:01.830
people I thought all the people that I

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:03.930
put up with they all let they all stop

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:05.220
making me put up with them because of

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:08.880
you true

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.920
well those people all sucked they were

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.930
all [ __ ] and you know now that your

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:14.190
night so now that you're not doing

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:15.810
stand-up really you don't have to

01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:18.240
pretend to network with open mike rizzo

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.619
or it's harder guys because they have

01:03:19.619 --> 01:03:21.390
one bar show yeah it's pretty pretty

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:24.180
awesome really it that's really it you

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.619
can stop being like oh this is an

01:03:25.619 --> 01:03:27.240
interesting story some [ __ ] guy I

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.030
would never ever talk to ya ever yeah

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:31.920
but between those people and the [ __ ]

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.560
negative nancies that you know snicker

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.320
behind our backs basically everything we

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.400
do my my social conscience is extremely

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.619
clear I've got I've got it's an open

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:46.349
landscape hell yeah I know what open our

01:03:46.349 --> 01:03:48.000
pathways to just genuine interactions

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.380
with the people I actually care about it

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.760
rules that's the truth and I'll let in a

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.800
lot of cases that's come through very

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.660
vague [ __ ] passive-aggressive

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.150
[ __ ] related to our [ __ ] podcasts

01:03:57.150 --> 01:04:01.020
which is really with it yeah it's always

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.250
it's always the dudes you would think it

01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:04.320
is it's always guys that

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.360
very soft skin and very slouchy

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:11.250
shoulders making us talking about our

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:13.500
[ __ ] gay-ass feelings or using [ __ ]

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.810

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:16.950

01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:23.460
is the the caster that's the point that

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.530
is the point yeah yeah so it's not it's

01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:26.370
not even like we could there's an

01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:28.050
argument to be had it's just like well

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:29.280
if you'd it's not for you dude then

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.350
whatever man it's not funny to everybody

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:34.770
that's like yes we're sorry we're into

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:36.420
bettering our lives and telling people

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:39.450
how we feel about them yeah yeah yeah it

01:04:39.450 --> 01:04:42.330
says he reminds me of early on right

01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:44.280
when me and Matt's like we started to

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.810
gain some traction this dude that was

01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:47.460
like a fan of the podcast came up to me

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:48.690
while I was in front of one of those

01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:51.420
types of comics and the dude was like I

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.800
[ __ ] love your podcast the rules

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.390
whatever and walked away and that comic

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.130
was like I can't believe people listened

01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:58.650
to that I'm just like dude why would you

01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:01.410

01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:03.000
was like it can't people still listen to

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.400
that and I was like dude more people

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.990
