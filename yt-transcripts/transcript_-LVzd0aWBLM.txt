less than that

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:39.669

like getting your this guy his whole

00:11:21.189 --> 00:11:22.569
thing was like he would tattoo his

somehow and like he was tatting them up

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.849
and making them skinny yeah doing that

00:11:36.849 --> 00:11:40.720
who the Nazis yeah wow I didn't think

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.309
about that you did not think about that

00:11:42.309 --> 00:11:44.859
[ __ ] it was just like a little teeny

00:11:44.859 --> 00:11:47.789
tattoo a very very naughty ish tat

00:11:47.789 --> 00:11:50.409
how about that I don't know I was think

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:51.339
about these I was thing about the Jews

00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:53.319
today really it's about the just about

00:11:53.319 --> 00:11:54.999
being a secret Jew it's like I was

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:58.149
cracking me up what the outside of the

00:11:58.149 --> 00:11:59.949
World War two context there have been

00:11:59.949 --> 00:12:02.739
other secret Jews out there there's

00:12:02.739 --> 00:12:04.059
definitely people who hide their Jewish

00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:05.649
identity which is just like it's so

00:12:05.649 --> 00:12:07.539
funny to think you need to hide what you

00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:09.819
do I know but some people like you dude

00:12:09.819 --> 00:12:11.409
not me I don't care about it you know

00:12:11.409 --> 00:12:13.299
you're out seeking out Jews you're

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:14.859
hunting them out every time Gerber comes

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.919
on you're always you're always bugging

00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:19.779
him about being Jews only nationality

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:22.389
you can hide and be secret about yeah

00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:24.369
you know it's like there's there's no

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:26.079
like secret Irish or secret it's not

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.570
denying my Irish hair they should

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:33.190
pure Saxon change your Navy Gillis

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.530
Burgin flip the script who claiming Jew

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.030
is a cig that there's a lot of people

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.160
who flip the script and claimed you yeah

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.840
if there's a lot of fake Jews out there

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.520
I'm only beginning to think that

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.260
Jewishness doesn't even exist

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.540
might be a PSYOP it's a state of mind

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.520
dude in my view it might be a pure açaí

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.910

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:31.130
extra 15 minutes after I'm done with

three rounds and I was literally I was

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.960
in the I mean I was in a fewer [ __ ]

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.400
clear mental space dude after three

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.929

00:23:38.929 --> 00:23:40.850
see if I can become chiller so I was

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:41.960

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:47.150
oh oh I'll do that guys so relaxed that

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.880

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.260

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.500
promotes him from enjoying it

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.720

Li like stupidly volunteered myself I

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.720
like dared myself to like shotgun my

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.700
vape in as hard as I could and then the

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.050
whole crowd actually got behind it so I

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:29.850
like started off the show and I go oh I

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.040

O'Connor like she always Hinchcliffe the

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.970
[ __ ] man sodor was standing by the

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:32.070

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.000
man yeah

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.400
damn why doc Smith my problem with

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.080
knowing my problem but it was like the

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.670
the thing I had with Hinchcliffe is I

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:42.030
imagined him I thought he was a young

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.710
like literally I thought like when I saw

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:45.420
bridge fall so I was like that's not I

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.220
thought Tony hitch looked like exactly a

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.660
young rich boss

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.849
and I saw yeah for some reason I thought

00:36:50.849 --> 00:36:53.460
he was like Hinchcliffe was like like a

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.010
leather jacket like tough like tough

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.869
type of dude I don't know why yeah then

I saw him I was like Jesus looks like a

00:36:59.339 --> 00:37:01.289
wiener yeah that was my that was just

00:37:01.289 --> 00:37:03.780
that's my only opinion it's meaningless

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.309
it's just like me he's confusing people

00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:06.450

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:07.559
too when I went to skank bus I kept

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:10.950
thinking I was seeing people I knew from

like having done stand-up that I didn't

00:37:12.869 --> 00:37:14.190

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.869
poor everyone is Howard is we're in for

00:39:57.869 --> 00:40:01.140
the [ __ ] or in Fortitude sure we're

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.520
gonna get storm they're gonna storm the

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.530
castle on us we're gonna be [ __ ] hey

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:06.450
who's gonna storm the castle on him see

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.900
the the [ __ ] growing the pours the

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.240
growing body of like the porch dyeing

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.130
pores so you think the pores so this is

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.230
Marxism now it's not Marxism you think

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.490
the working class and the pores are

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:19.650
gonna rise up well it's not Marxism if

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.320
they just rise up and kill us all just

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.910
then being like we're dying we're gonna

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.589
it's a whole different thing well that's

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:26.849
kind of exactly what Karl Marx was

00:40:26.849 --> 00:40:28.140
saying I'm not saying we should just

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.180
like Cheryl all of our selves your

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:30.839
Marxist

00:40:30.839 --> 00:40:33.390
and you're a new deal I'm into the green

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:35.790
new deal yes Wow okay the arguments

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:37.770
against it are very weak against the

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:40.190
green New Deal super [ __ ] weak um

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:42.990
people are like what am I gonna fly to

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.030
on vacation in Barbados it's like yeah

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:47.250
dude you can't until people come up with

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:48.270
a way to get there there was some other

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:49.830
stuff in the green new deal that she was

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:52.020
tossing in this is awesome like some

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.000
equality [ __ ] about whatever don't like

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.160
about the stuff people don't like about

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.420
it yeah they did throw in stuff like

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:00.540
against cows I think they said yeah I

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.430
was like cows yeah because of the carbon

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.410
emissions yeah yeah that's of I'm not

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:05.490
really I'm not too worried about that

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:09.270
but you do like shutting down I shut it

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:11.190
all down till you not even that just do

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.750
a slowly phase that I have a ten year

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.010
plan to phase it out that's that

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.390
other thing to have a plan to face all

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.310
that out yeah and you have like now you

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:21.300
have like I saw a thing it was like [ __ ]

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.980
who was this it was like Chevron Bill

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.240
Gates apparently I don't what the [ __ ]

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.380
he has to do with this and like a couple

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.390
of the oil companies who are like yeah

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.470
we're gonna do this new thing now we

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.390
like shoot gas into the air and have

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:31.920
high powered with high-powered fans and

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.240
that's gonna like suck the co2 out of

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.120
the air so party on everybody I just I

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.610
don't think this whole thing of like oh

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:40.140
we're just gonna go figure

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.220
eventually though someone will figure

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.990
out how I'm like I don't think anyone

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.550
knows what the [ __ ] going on I think

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.520
99% of people are stupid yeah 99% of

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.070
people are stupid and or stupid kind of

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:52.530
dumb yeah on some levels are dumb to the

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:54.240
point where they kind of don't know what

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.800
they're doing with themselves for the

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.180
most part they're hopelessly kind of

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.890
just scrambling through the world and

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:00.960
its moral I think what's going to happen

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.090
is more or less a just as chaotic

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:04.740
scramble towards like everyone's going

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.330
for like a certain status and it's like

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:08.520
no one wants to stop the [ __ ] and be

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.900
like all right well let's [ __ ] let's

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.610
do a hard time out on this whole thing

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:13.230
this whole thing's getting out of

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.720
control most likely scenario that we go

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.550
out and I can flash like a fevered flash

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:19.560
of just like something sort of hard to

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.080
apocalyptic event yeah no one's ever

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.730
gonna there's not gonna be a time when

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:26.040
everyone stops enough to be like yeah we

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.300
are kind of but [ __ ] this whole

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.800
planet around us we have to just let's

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.570
all take a [ __ ] like wow dude the

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:32.790
green new Matt green a high five and it

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:35.430
[ __ ] my whoa list forever

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.500
ever since I ate mushrooms I laid on a

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.090
soccer field I was like I would [ __ ]

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.470
defend this I was on a hill and I was

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:41.760
like I would I totally understand why

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.710
people would fight over [ __ ] over

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:46.110
grass oh my god kill someone for this

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:47.820
place right now but that was more of

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.470
like a territorial thing yeah I

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:51.330
understood all they do all right oh yeah

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:53.310
I walked out here I'm gonna fight him I

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:54.660
was laying on a hill and I remember

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.260
being like dude I could totally

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.760
understand why Native Americans used to

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.440
like go like shoot arrows at people they

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.690
get off this oh yeah I felt that I felt

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:01.740
that run through me

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.020
my thing it the funniest part is it

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:07.110
sounds so ridiculous to be like what we

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.120
can't completely devastate the whole

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.070
thing that everything depends on people

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.500
like it's like dude we're [ __ ] we're

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.910
the only thing that's gonna rock us out

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:16.980
of it is like a billion dead I don't

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.530
know Billy bro I gotta see the science

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.180
right now I think it's a bunch of I

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:26.580
think it's a crock I anticipate a carbon

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.069
is

00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:28.779
it's small let's not let's not pretend

00:43:28.779 --> 00:43:30.670
it's not affecting it like humans are

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:32.920
affecting the global you know climate

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.410
change slightly dude I think it's the

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:38.140
natural occurrence both agree on this

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.420
out the car I'll remove carbon my thing

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.249
is still out dude the science is still

00:43:42.249 --> 00:43:43.779
out on this no one knows nobody does

00:43:43.779 --> 00:43:45.339
know the carbon is I will say that no

00:43:45.339 --> 00:43:46.839
one knows baby no one knows that how

00:43:46.839 --> 00:43:49.089
every bit flow and however do we got a

00:43:49.089 --> 00:43:50.640
lot of natural resources in this country

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.949
we need to exploit I'm Pro fracking the

00:43:53.949 --> 00:43:57.759
way more oil oil no dude I stopped no

00:43:57.759 --> 00:43:59.529
it's like so if you were telling me you

00:43:59.529 --> 00:44:00.249
don't like blue

00:44:00.249 --> 00:44:01.809
I [ __ ] that awful if you're Ronnie

00:44:01.809 --> 00:44:02.890
but the thing is is like who's gonna

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.690
stop driving not me I'm not I'm not even

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:06.099
gonna say that might if you're running

00:44:06.099 --> 00:44:09.579
pipes through the just the ground and

00:44:09.579 --> 00:44:11.289
through the ocean they're naturally on a

00:44:11.289 --> 00:44:13.420
deteriorating leak just like thousands

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.160
of gallons of oil all over the place and

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.140
like that's like good dude want the

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:18.819
ocean you ever be in the ocean yeah it's

00:44:18.819 --> 00:44:19.150
awesome

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:25.479
no it's scary don't be funny give oil on

00:44:25.479 --> 00:44:26.829
you but the ocean will be fun again dude

00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:31.779
I'm a staunch ocean great again and you

00:44:31.779 --> 00:44:33.009
were fearless and you'd go out and have

00:44:33.009 --> 00:44:34.930
fun in the water true now you're a grown

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:36.910
man you know the [ __ ] terrors beneath

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.219
all worried about like getting in the

00:44:39.219 --> 00:44:40.809
Gulf and be like am I gonna die in this

00:44:40.809 --> 00:44:43.209
toxic soup no who cares I think it's

00:44:43.209 --> 00:44:44.709
good stuff in there yeah get in there

00:44:44.709 --> 00:44:47.799
dude I'm around I just it's it's funny

00:44:47.799 --> 00:44:49.719
though and again where does a couple

00:44:49.719 --> 00:44:51.940
schmoes dude but speak for yourself that

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.459
best minds have compiled a system where

00:44:54.459 --> 00:44:56.799
it's like we just dump our trash over

00:44:56.799 --> 00:45:00.339
there it's just [ __ ] amassing in

00:45:00.339 --> 00:45:02.109
mountains and there's this oil bursting

00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:03.279
out into the ocean and everyone's just

00:45:03.279 --> 00:45:06.130
kind of like Oh what I'm not [ __ ] fly

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:07.869
- you're up dude oh the [ __ ] me it's

00:45:07.869 --> 00:45:10.239
like and it sounds annoying to even

00:45:10.239 --> 00:45:11.859
bring it up I guess what are we hit the

00:45:11.859 --> 00:45:13.869
point where it's like I would love for

00:45:13.869 --> 00:45:15.849
just a [ __ ] worldwide timeout where

00:45:15.849 --> 00:45:17.079
everyone's like alright alright everyone

00:45:17.079 --> 00:45:19.209
let's chill and reassess this is clearly

00:45:19.209 --> 00:45:21.670
kind of [ __ ] up chill out you don't

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:22.869
they Devon it doesn't have to share all

00:45:22.869 --> 00:45:24.400
your money with everybody like you said

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.019
fall back like you said people are dumb

00:45:26.019 --> 00:45:27.999
dude most people are gonna be really

00:45:27.999 --> 00:45:29.440
hard to tell everyone it doesn't even

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.289
dumb it just self-possessed into like

00:45:31.289 --> 00:45:33.430
like the right everyone try to stop it

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.979
like mm I'm not gonna stop cuz the other

00:45:35.979 --> 00:45:37.989
guy's not gonna stop exactly yeah it's

00:45:37.989 --> 00:45:39.579
weird dude it's like it's like a mini

00:45:39.579 --> 00:45:40.620
nuclear arms race

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.410
and the [ __ ] the Republican Party is

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:45.180
somehow embraced because do you have to

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.040
pick sides on everything yeah I love

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.870
that they've embraced [ __ ] climate

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:54.510
changes at hoax they go argue it what

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:56.610
you brought a snowball in remember that

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.670
yeah it's [ __ ] cold out baby yo my

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.140
hands are cold it's [ __ ] on this you

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.800
know dude [ __ ] that yeah it's it's a

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.870
that is that is a funny that is a sick

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:08.400
stance this would be like nah dude we're

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.410
fine dude they're the carbon stuff I

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:11.820
don't know about that I just know

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.620
fundamentally if you're constantly

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:17.970
spilling oil into the ocean it's bad has

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:19.530
to be bet it has to be bad how the

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:21.930
oceans big dude don't worry about it has

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:24.300
to be bad plenty of fresh water out

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:26.160
there dude that and they're like Frank

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.110
don't let them fool you about fracking

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:29.730
fracking is great I don't lose our

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.160
sponsor that's our best one you know the

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.140
sponsor causes like an earthquake last

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:34.560
week

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.820
did they really yeah dude how awesome

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.350
are they it was an earthquake even

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:39.510
Philadelphia did they really there's an

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:44.970
earthquake in Pennsylvania no what was

been trying to just get my girlfriend to

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:10.440
admit that she'd say she's like I [ __ ]

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.579
up attitude I'm like you're on your

00:49:11.579 --> 00:49:12.990
period you're definitely just on your

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:15.930
period and she was just like you always

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:18.059
say I'm like dude like you used why why

00:49:18.059 --> 00:49:20.579
is that such an embarrassing thing to

00:49:20.579 --> 00:49:23.279
admit she's cranky I'm like dude it's

00:49:23.279 --> 00:49:26.099
it's I'm I'm here that sucks I feel bad

00:49:26.099 --> 00:49:28.019
I don't have that but if I were to be

00:49:28.019 --> 00:49:30.390
just like out of nowhere super cranky

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:33.210
and something like all of science was

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:34.950
like yeah this this sends your hormones

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:37.140
in the fluctuation it happens they're

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.890
like almost all women so normal and yet

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:42.420
none of them can admit that that's

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:43.799
what's going on I mean I get cuz it's

00:49:43.799 --> 00:49:46.619
probably amplifying real-life events you

00:49:46.619 --> 00:49:48.630
know I mean so it's like it doesn't feel

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.250
it is their reality because it is real

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:51.329
there's real things that are happening

00:49:51.329 --> 00:49:52.740
but what I'm trying to explain around

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.589
like yes this is real however you're

00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:57.180
extremely sensitive to it right now

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.160
because your hormones are going [ __ ]

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.329
wild right now yeah

00:50:00.329 --> 00:50:04.079
due to this tri-weekly phenomena that is

00:50:04.079 --> 00:50:05.880
your period it comes

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.100
every three weeks and then you hate me

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.230
and you started now said to be very mean

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:12.770
to me and I for some reason I you know I

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:14.760
tolerated I tolerate this but you have

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.370
to just show me you believe in this dude

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:19.230
show me you believe I might be the Al

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:20.430
Gore of furious dude

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:23.550
get a chart I might do bring a chart out

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:24.900
and show her I might be the allergy

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.080
here's how much of a con you were and

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.270
then get one of those get a crane a lift

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:31.860
and be like now if you look the chart

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.300
goes all the way up here because of how

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.220
much of a kite Yuma being because your

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.290
[ __ ] here's your baseline continious

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:39.510
this is Jake I pretty I actually pretty

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:41.220
high amount of [ __ ] but nothing you know

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.600
al you weren't and then look at this

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.360
lady this spike that goes up there that

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.430
was a week the week straight now why do

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.050
you think that was and then look at this

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:51.720
back down now you're very remorseful not

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.730
Kunti once the period ends it's love

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:55.890
time yeah man once that period goes down

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:58.140
they're like I'm sorry I love you so

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:00.000
much better miss you dude I've thought

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.620
about this and it's a it's a risky

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:04.080
endeavor I thought about just keeping us

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.910
like a separate journal I have my own

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:07.410
cash to keep my sorry you should get an

00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:10.290
app for her cycle and then plan to be

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:12.930
away from her every time she's all good

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:14.970
it's not bad right what I want to do is

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.640
do the opposite stay in stay in it and

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.830
journal everything and then date and

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:21.930
time all the events and then just be

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:23.700
like a mass like a year's worth of data

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.680
and just wait the next time she's being

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.510
a crab and it's be like come here and

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:29.310

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.060
like a Rusco lair get a storage unit

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:37.650
five years now I like here you have like

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:39.390

like keeping audio recorder on I've dude

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.950
I'm telling you I've I went through this

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:53.010
mean Corp would break up every period

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.440
mmm every once a month we would break up

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.680
gonna be like after five months I was

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.470

break up every time you have your period

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:05.580
we break up yeah there's that weird what

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.590
do you think about that I don't

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:09.690

[ __ ] yeah when you're blacked out do

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:25.559

yeah I mean this is this is a tale as

00:52:39.539 --> 00:52:41.849
old as time I know but let's go deeper

00:52:41.849 --> 00:52:43.680
in dude I want to understand my thing is

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.480
like 20 that when you get older you like

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.579
every one of these cliche things is just

00:52:47.579 --> 00:52:50.819
totally true yeah like women on their

00:52:50.819 --> 00:52:52.500
period is a major problem

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.079
you stay away from them it's great yeah

00:52:55.079 --> 00:52:56.759
yeah and it is it does sound cliche but

00:52:56.759 --> 00:52:58.789
I'm like as you get older when you have

00:52:58.789 --> 00:53:00.900
when you're younger you're just like man

really unfair to me what's out to you

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.640

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.180
gibberish dude we're talking about like

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:26.740
bad energy you need to release all the

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.180
bad energy that's floating around it's

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:29.770
out there that's ridiculous

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:31.870
better shut up about bad energy you

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:33.550
don't believe in Jeju I don't believe in

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:35.890
juju what do you think it is you can you

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:37.720
don't believe in psychic phenomena not

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.270
that much but not like psychic like

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.190
tarot readers I'm talking about the fact

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:43.470
that you're constructing like a

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:46.780
completely psychic experience that's not

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:47.650
what I'm talking about

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:49.000
here's some what you talking about I'm

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.970
talking about air voids bad energy what

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:52.390
do you mean

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:54.970
like if I stretch hard enough bad energy

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:57.160
who's gonna go away you don't think the

00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.570
body keeps the score and holds the

00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:00.700
[ __ ] the trauma inside you you don't

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.520
think your hips store your stress no I'm

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.050
doing this I've been your class this is

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:09.370
what I did the fight we got it is it

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:11.500
really yes how did I guess that I swear

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.540
to God and tell you know oh thank god

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.520
you get in trouble you don't you dare

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:17.320
try to silence noise shut the [ __ ] up

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.970
dude no that's the intro that's when I

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:20.500
do that when I would do the the pigeon

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.180
pose there I remember being there like a

00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:24.400
lot of your bad a lot of your [ __ ]

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:27.490
that's exactly the fight and I was like

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:29.200
really I remember like thinking like I

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.730
guess I am feeling kind of emotional

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:33.010
right now it's like stret like stress

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:35.560
and trauma stored in your hips yeah and

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.120
I was like dude I swear to God I just

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:40.240
comes like you could I was like I don't

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.100
think it's trauma is not stored in your

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:46.330
hips you think listen

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:50.050
body keeps score but there's not to say

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:53.170
that like stress can you know muscle

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.640
tension and [ __ ] like that can easily be

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:57.340
stored natives from stress sure from

00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:59.530
very reasonable like you can explain

00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:01.600
what that is it's not just bad energy

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.240
floating in the air like bad energy and

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.230
I was like if you want to call it bad

00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:08.020
energy instead of like stress sure we

00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.820
could do that it's the same thing

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:11.680
stress is a real thing that causes

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.020
health issues what if as an animal when

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.460
you're in a bad mood you put off

00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:17.260
pheromones that other people detect as

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.050
bad energy well then that's exactly what

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:21.550
it is it's pheromones it's not you don't

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:22.540
believe it the better well then it's

00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.250
pheromones it's not you add energy got

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:26.080
you but I understand the terminology can

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.550
call it that that's why it's a Native

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:29.560
American gibberish because you're using

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:31.690
spirituality instead of science on that

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:35.290
damn that's pretty tight so you're

00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:39.810
you're a rugged materialist well I don't

00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:44.640
I don't know materialists but like

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.960
that's all I'm saying I get it like if

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.730
you stretch your hips you'll feel better

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:51.580
sure that's all you never got it never

00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:53.050
got deep in a pigeon and got like kind

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:55.030
of misty I know I got [ __ ] that

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:56.890
lizard stretch where you put your

00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:00.550
[ __ ] elbows down oh I feel good I'm

00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:05.800
like I miss my dad I need to call him

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.260
yeah man that's too funny

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.390
right I do die thank you that was uh

00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:11.770
that was the first thing I thought about

00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:13.090
what are you worried about if this whole

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:17.980
[ __ ] it gets court dog gonna be fired up

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:20.650
this is gonna be a rough one that's a

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:21.940
fair argument to have though that you

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:24.220
don't believe in that yeah but like I

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:27.130
was like it just started from evening

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:28.240
like yeah no that's true

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:31.000
yeah and that was a fight and then in

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.410
that fight I thought we were still

00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:34.420
kidding around and that's when I was

00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:36.610
like it's all [ __ ] gibberish like

00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:39.490
damn yeah that's like you know people

00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:41.740
are trying to fill the religious void so

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:44.170
you just you God blocked her yeah I mean

00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:46.600
but she's right on a lot of levels of

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.610
that like yoga's great it is gonna do it

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:50.710
feels good yeah it makes you feel better

00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:53.470
it relieves a lot of stress do when I

00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:55.240
when I would do yoga for big guys out in

00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:58.480
the living room never cry no I'd never

00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.350
cry yeah

00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:01.690
get deep and I'll never cry eating it

00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:03.970
diva oh yoga for big guys is pretty it's

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:04.600
pretty basic

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:08.110
a lot of farts dude it's like bend over

00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:09.490
and let that fart out I know you have

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:10.870
one guaranteed for it

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:12.910
I farted an exercise class yesterday it

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:14.080
stunk

00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.700
I was just you know you let out like

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.950
little like a bubble at a time yeah you

00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:19.870
like let out one fart into eight bubbles

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:22.690
dude i was rationing bubbles i would

00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:24.040
just be doing the bowel robes and i'd be

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.840
like did I just hear a switch with a

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.010
person I'd be over there doing high

00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:29.350
knees and be like let out like one

00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:30.100
bubble yeah

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.410
no way one bubbles gonna smell my whole

00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:38.020
corner off I destroyed the plane on the

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:40.450
way to San Francisco that morning cuz I

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:42.820
was drinking all night oh dude I woke up

00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:44.440
like three hours of sleep having just

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.720
drank all night just farted the whole

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.900
[ __ ] 6-hour flight the plot is like

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.300
dude cuz on a flight you can sneak far

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:52.870
it's easy

00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:55.150
did you know I go they could look at me

00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:56.680
and tell where the distension was coming

00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.700
from but [ __ ] clear target for farts

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:03.550
I get more I understand like when

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:05.350
Muslims are like Sikhs try to get on a

01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:07.390
plane and people like it's keeping an

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:10.450
eye on you I get the look for farts they

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.150
get it for terrorism I feel like

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.410
somebody sees me walking down the aisle

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:15.370
they're like I'm gonna keep an eye on

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:18.700
that guy the whole flight he farting or

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:20.590
they'd avoid fart detection yeah being

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:22.780
if you're like a big dog time but if you

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.640
have like messy hair then people also if

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.080
you if you have a flight with bedhead

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.720
your prime suspect of a fart so if you

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.250
if you hid in a suit slicked back your

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:32.290
hair you can literally audibly fart be

01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:33.220
like wasn't him

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.970
no it was him no way to profession I was

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:39.670
farting at one point I farted and blamed

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.380
it mentally blame someone else I was it

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:42.910

01:01:13.949 --> 01:01:16.390
you own acknowledged fart a lot dude

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:18.579

01:01:18.579 --> 01:01:21.279
are so crazy to me dude there's a few of

01:01:21.279 --> 01:01:22.869
our friends that'll look you in the eyes

01:01:22.869 --> 01:01:27.400
and fart it's nuts well sometimes I get

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.929
caught up in the moment I'm like again

01:01:28.929 --> 01:01:30.729
like I get in the bubble system where

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:32.229
I'm like I'm gonna wet I have a third it

01:01:32.229 --> 01:01:34.419

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:40.929
bubble and you're like [ __ ] you fart

01:01:40.929 --> 01:01:42.939
they immediately try to lie but then I

01:01:42.939 --> 01:01:44.739
start laughing in the middle of a crisis

01:01:44.739 --> 01:01:46.659
party the fact that you smelled it makes

01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:51.069
me like so smart like oh yes pretty much

01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:52.869
every comedy show I think I farted at

01:01:52.869 --> 01:01:54.909

01:01:58.509 --> 01:02:00.939
that whole building was farts I let out

01:02:00.939 --> 01:02:02.199
a nice one when I was sitting there

01:02:02.199 --> 01:02:02.619
waiting

01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:04.749
oh no we're about to go down I farted in

01:02:04.749 --> 01:02:07.089
the kitchen you remember that I

01:02:07.089 --> 01:02:10.559
definitely farted real hard

01:02:12.599 --> 01:02:15.999
damn yeah I might I was hammered yeah

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:17.859
yeah you were drinking all day I like

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:20.650
don't remember much of that cast yeah

01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:22.449
yeah I was a little bit I was a little

01:02:22.449 --> 01:02:25.599
flimsy on it too but do this so this is

01:02:25.599 --> 01:02:27.429
what whatever you're talking about it

01:02:27.429 --> 01:02:28.329
reminded me of uh

01:02:28.329 --> 01:02:30.219
we were talking about psychic phenomena

01:02:30.219 --> 01:02:32.739
I was talking I don't know was really on

01:02:32.739 --> 01:02:34.059
board of this in class I was basically

01:02:34.059 --> 01:02:38.199
saying how we got out of uh [ __ ] what

01:02:38.199 --> 01:02:39.939
was really they're talking about how

01:02:39.939 --> 01:02:43.119
like battling the battling groups of

01:02:43.119 --> 01:02:44.469
like the different political views and

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:46.599
how it's like you'll have someone who

01:02:46.599 --> 01:02:47.679
thinks they're well-intentioned but all

01:02:47.679 --> 01:02:49.659
they're doing is just attacking like in

01:02:49.659 --> 01:02:51.999
the case of like a super Lib attacking

01:02:51.999 --> 01:02:53.380
like a trump supporter yeah being

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.689
justified he's a racist homophobic piece

01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:58.479
of [ __ ] and honestly he deserves my full

01:02:58.479 --> 01:03:00.669
fury my whole point was like dude unless

01:03:00.669 --> 01:03:02.589
you're you can attack but unless you're

01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:04.359
under the umbrella of just like we're

01:03:04.359 --> 01:03:06.459
all [ __ ] you know it's like I'm gonna

01:03:06.459 --> 01:03:07.599
break down why I don't I think

01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:08.919
yourselves [ __ ] but I'm not gonna

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:11.319
attack your personal character you know

01:03:11.319 --> 01:03:12.880
I'm gonna try not to as hard as I can

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.709
rather than being like you a [ __ ]

01:03:14.709 --> 01:03:16.150
piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] you I hate you yeah

01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:18.939
it's like I don't to be morally just we

01:03:18.939 --> 01:03:21.189
talked about 200 times but my thing and

01:03:21.189 --> 01:03:22.419
what I was telling the teacher which you

01:03:22.419 --> 01:03:24.579
know I was waiting for a super high five

01:03:24.579 --> 01:03:25.760
or something dude

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.060
Kame it's basically that we are now so

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.310
we our parents were raised by people in

01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:32.540
the Great Depression for the most part

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.400
or you're an immigrant and your parents

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.680
came from like you know just what like

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.450
someone's the regular depression they're

01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:42.530
always having yeah so either way we're

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:45.470
for the most part one most people are

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:47.480
one or two generations away from people

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.850
who like ate [ __ ] during the Great

01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:51.980
Depression so they raised your parents

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.630
who are just kind of like you know if

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:55.340
they get a job they're just like I'm

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.840
doing it I don't your problem is we're

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.820
more or less there's you know if you're

01:03:58.820 --> 01:03:59.960
like being like a Vanderbilt you've

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.040
obviously been dealing for a while but

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.840
there's a lot of people entering the

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.780
realm of just like pure psychic

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.940
competition to where it's like material

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.890
needs are met will be met forever for

01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:12.140
the most part and you were just battling

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.450
on some weird like Star Wars Jedi [ __ ]

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:15.830
where it's like they're only

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:17.450
consequences is perceived for like

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:19.040
importance if you know if that's you

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.150
know if you know what I mean not totally

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:21.710
under there's more and more people now

01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:23.360
entering that race to where like you

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.120
watch like with everyone's in the race

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.740
everyone's in this especially the

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.800
younger generation of us but yes younger

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.450
than us is [ __ ] not it so the

01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:34.940
generation of just pure Instagram it's

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:37.310
your social media importance yes it is

01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:39.650
wild it's pure ego battle so now we

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:41.840
think we're now in a limitless ego

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.800
battle that's more or less based on like

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.420
nothing that tangible but it does have

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.460
serious effects on people's biochemistry

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.230
so that phrase like get under your skin

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:53.900
it's like we're out here waging war to

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.460
like not be super depressed and anxious

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.980
yeah and only like you know II believe

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.170
in like if the people who apparently win

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:01.370
a lot of times are super depressing

01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:03.680
anxious yeah and that's that's what this

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.520
that's what I was trying to explain

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.800
though our whole thing is predicated on

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.990
just like a weird psychic ego battle

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:10.490
we're all having that's just ramping up

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:12.050
more and more and more the same time

01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:14.210
it's like we're [ __ ] off we're

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:17.120
kicking up dust everywhere he's like

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.920
dude it's not looking good

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.290
I think we're ER like it makes more

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:23.320
sense to me that we were just slowly I

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:27.080
think we're going for a hard extinction

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.810
I think that's inevitable it might scare

01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:32.570
back 150 years but like that's the

01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:34.730
biggest that's like the biggest uh wool

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:36.680
over all her eyes to like know we're

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.750
gonna like save the tree otter and like

01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:39.589
do this like dude

01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:41.539
we're [ __ ] that tree otter is dead all

01:05:41.539 --> 01:05:43.069
the animals around us are going extinct

01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:44.569
and it's not typically our fault a ton

01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:46.369
of it like species have gone extinct

01:05:46.369 --> 01:05:48.140
from this time we've been here but it's

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:50.299
like dude it's there's clearly like the

01:05:50.299 --> 01:05:51.739
boardwalk like you ever see that coin

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:53.509
game or just pushes quarters over the

01:05:53.509 --> 01:05:57.199
edge dude like we're getting closer and

01:05:57.199 --> 01:05:58.880
it's going to push us off yeah but I

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.259
think that's something is like natural

01:06:00.259 --> 01:06:01.609
is accepting as death is like the

01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:04.579
extinction of your entire species wrap

01:06:04.579 --> 01:06:05.180
your head around that

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:07.309
whoa grab your head around that one yeah

01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:08.539
people that people can't get over

01:06:08.539 --> 01:06:09.890
themselves not existing it's like

01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:12.259
Braille I hate to break it to you we're

01:06:12.259 --> 01:06:14.209
all to know this is gonna exist we're

01:06:14.209 --> 01:06:16.729
all toast except the cast the cast will

01:06:16.729 --> 01:06:18.769
live on the cast technology so that

01:06:18.769 --> 01:06:21.199
it'll be it will be I mean dude there's

01:06:21.199 --> 01:06:23.539
how awesome aliens how awesome is God

01:06:23.539 --> 01:06:25.339
that this cast will live on because I

01:06:25.339 --> 01:06:27.439
dude our God is an awesome God

01:06:27.439 --> 01:06:31.400
how cool is my prophet oh dude the

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.660
Prophet is gonna make sure that this

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:34.099
lives on for sure

01:06:34.099 --> 01:06:35.719
so some [ __ ] chillax aliens are

01:06:35.719 --> 01:06:37.309
probably listening this right now yeah

01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:39.529
dude think about that you ever get that

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:41.119
when you're just like definitely

01:06:41.119 --> 01:06:41.900
listening to this right now

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:45.890
oh so funny ha ha oh dude that was like

01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:48.529
funny yet deep Swede whoa you know

01:06:48.529 --> 01:06:50.719
humans could be this [ __ ] chill past

01:06:50.719 --> 01:06:52.699
me that CBD that fills our spaceship

01:06:52.699 --> 01:06:55.640
infinite CBD fuels ships yeah dude

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.259
that's what Rob bob lazar was looking

01:06:57.259 --> 01:07:00.469
for figure out the anti green element

01:07:00.469 --> 01:07:02.719
115 is just sick ass cvd makes me

01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:04.609
[ __ ] float if you put it in the ship

01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:06.289
the ship's like I'm not [ __ ] attached

01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:07.939
to anything not even grab it did you

01:07:07.939 --> 01:07:09.259
ever get that when you're driving and

01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:10.670
you're just all of a sudden just go like

01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:13.400
oh Jesus Christ like you get hit with

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.809
like the complete totality of your

01:07:14.809 --> 01:07:16.279
existence and how weird it is that you

01:07:16.279 --> 01:07:17.539
can like think and talk and there's been

01:07:17.539 --> 01:07:18.559
all this stuff that happened before you

01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:21.679
and just go like oh god yeah if I mean

01:07:21.679 --> 01:07:22.759
I've had those thoughts yeah

01:07:22.759 --> 01:07:24.589
did you ever get the full [ __ ] you never

01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:26.839
made me jump I've got it before I get

01:07:26.839 --> 01:07:28.640
like legitimately free I feel like I'm

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.319
like but it's definitely been times I've

01:07:30.319 --> 01:07:31.999
had to snap myself out of it like wow

01:07:31.999 --> 01:07:34.029
I'm thinking about just that guy Jesus

01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:36.589
I'll be dry I'll just be driving by

01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:41.839
myself in the car on this thing oh

01:07:41.839 --> 01:07:43.339
you're driving you're just like you

01:07:43.339 --> 01:07:44.749
started being like wait a second I can

01:07:44.749 --> 01:07:46.640
you know like I can think and you're

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.529
like what the [ __ ] you thinking about I

01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:49.489
think therefore I am

01:07:49.489 --> 01:07:52.339
like oh god I've done it before I've got

01:07:52.339 --> 01:07:53.509
myself like too

01:07:53.509 --> 01:07:55.579
ooh a panic attack between like

01:07:55.579 --> 01:07:57.109
intermittent thoughts of outer space and

01:07:57.109 --> 01:08:00.289
thinking I miss like oh yeah get high

01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:02.630
and think of that stuff that's why I

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:05.059
don't like getting high really yeah I

01:08:05.059 --> 01:08:06.889
love did I say I can get high and think

01:08:06.889 --> 01:08:09.169
about dying and like what that's gonna

01:08:09.169 --> 01:08:11.149
be like yeah when I'm high enough I can

01:08:11.149 --> 01:08:13.219
like fully realize it oh yeah it's not

01:08:13.219 --> 01:08:16.639
good when you die yeah it's easy it's

01:08:16.639 --> 01:08:18.019
just what it was like before you were

01:08:18.019 --> 01:08:18.409
born

01:08:18.409 --> 01:08:20.000
well it's like everything's gonna be

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.119
going on and you're just not there I

01:08:22.119 --> 01:08:25.639
don't know no you never know mmm you

01:08:25.639 --> 01:08:27.949
don't think I do no dude I think I do

01:08:27.949 --> 01:08:28.940
what do you say what do you think it's

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:31.579
exactly like before I was born not bad

01:08:31.579 --> 01:08:34.699
yeah I didn't know exactly there was no

01:08:34.699 --> 01:08:36.230
I bro

01:08:36.230 --> 01:08:37.759
there's nothing dude I don't know I

01:08:37.759 --> 01:08:39.380
don't know I mean I definitely would be

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.989
dying would suck I just do I don't I

01:08:41.989 --> 01:08:43.460
don't worry I don't worry about it that

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:46.009
much I just don't uh my thing is like

01:08:46.009 --> 01:08:47.719
hey when you really worry about that it

01:08:47.719 --> 01:08:49.940
is flying oh yeah

01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:52.940
just I always also cuz there's so much

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:55.039
[ __ ] turbulence on that flight across

01:08:55.039 --> 01:08:57.710
like so much I'm farting turbulence not

01:08:57.710 --> 01:08:59.750
the lady next to me was horrified of

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:02.119
flying so anytime we hit turbulence she

01:09:02.119 --> 01:09:04.039
was like panicking which that sucks

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:05.690
that sucks to see someone like you're

01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:08.329
like I looked at her like you're alright

01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:09.380
look relax

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.449
what'd she say she was all right she was

01:09:11.449 --> 01:09:13.429
foreign I was trying to [ __ ] explain

01:09:13.429 --> 01:09:17.440
to her like it's fine everything's okay

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.549
but yeah the whole time every time I'm

01:09:19.549 --> 01:09:20.630
flying I'm just like well if I die I

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:22.789
just need to accept it yeah like it's

01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:25.670
okay if I die it'll be quick

01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:28.309
especially on a [ __ ] plane but the

01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:30.409
however long it takes to scream the

01:09:30.409 --> 01:09:32.960
whole way down like all those people on

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.750
there [ __ ] screaming that would suck

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:37.279
so that's the worst I don't want to hear

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:38.719
that I don't want the pandemonium before

01:09:38.719 --> 01:09:39.259
I die

01:09:39.259 --> 01:09:41.480
surely like chill out hanok of like

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:46.159
women and screaming yeah I worry more

01:09:46.159 --> 01:09:48.230
about that stretched out of the course

01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:50.239
of like two decades of just someone

01:09:50.239 --> 01:09:52.120
being in their life me like

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.190
it just do decades of quietly screaming

01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:59.530
ah yeah man that happens yeah man I

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:01.810
would love to have a nice hard midlife

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:04.150
crisis huh you might be

01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:06.850
I wouldn't mean I think I'd I had a

01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:08.530
quarter nice quarter like I'd be having

01:10:08.530 --> 01:10:11.380
like a subtle one right now I'm telling

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.480
you I don't think I am maybe I could go

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.590
back and forth whether or not I'm

01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:16.420
becoming like completely self-aware disk

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:19.320
of totally losing my mind

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.160
but I think that takes some

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.630
self-awareness I've racked up a hard

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:24.460
[ __ ] quarter life which is nice when

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.400
was that like about like 24 25 okay

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.460
that's like that what happen they're

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:35.140
married we're being like that way I can

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:36.700
get married and like I can just like do

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.260
stuff like stand-up and I could put all

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.820
my energy on stand-up and like you know

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.920
that'll solve the whole like romantic

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.360
aspect of my life I'll just have a life

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.800

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.180
thing dude

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:48.700
then it did I not know I was entering

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.200
into the [ __ ] world of smoke and

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.000
mirrors dude whoa I entered into that

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.280
being like I was when I was little I

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.260

and then like I was like well that's not

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:02.740

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.480

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.890

01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:29.980
couldn't talk about in a all right get

01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.570
to us gang fessing but it actually dealt

01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:33.760
stuff down so perfectly into what I

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.860
wanted to get into next what does that

01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:37.440
everyone I started talking about the

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.410
where like romantic love came from no

01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:43.000
there's the reading a book right now

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.870
there's don't remember the pocket was

01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:48.660
talking about the Halla came from like

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.950
they basically came from like it was

01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:53.590
like a religious so unlike that I think

01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:55.390
it was like 12 13th century they started

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:56.650
doing a thing where like you could

01:13:56.650 --> 01:14:00.040
experience ecstasy like religious purity

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.930
through another through a woman yeah man

01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:03.100
it was like all that chivalry and

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.810
knighthood where you just pick a woman

01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:07.120
you never this yeah yeah you never touch

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.070
her and you would just be like foul is

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:10.930
my queen dude and you just ride in this

01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:13.420
woman's purity it'll beg your boy's wife

01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:15.190
basically yeah and you would just be

01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:16.900
like she's so pure and [ __ ]

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:19.130
beautiful of heart nudists ride and they

01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:21.080
carry her banner but they're saying that

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.020
kind of created the whole weird illusion

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.310
of like romantic love and how it's

01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:26.930
something that's only like it's not that

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:27.350
old

01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:29.990
like no they'd be like I but they're the

01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:31.640
one I love it's like people have viewed

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.810
that it's like a weird fleeting thing

01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:34.130
and now like people build their whole

01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:36.380
lives upon like I'm gonna find the one I

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:37.880
like you think you're gonna find a

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.220
person who it's like your ideal sex

01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.870
partner ideal person that you're gonna

01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:43.700
be able to raise kids with ideal friend

01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:46.820
it's [ __ ] it's like kind of playing

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:48.710
scratch-off tickets it's I would say

01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:50.300
it's I think we're dealing with those

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.120
odds and no one wants to talk about that

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.920
yeah but being like I'm gonna find the

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.720
person who I get along with on like I

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.310
can have conversations with who I could

01:14:58.310 --> 01:15:01.850
co-parent with smooth smooth enough yeah

01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:03.100
where we don't hate each other

01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.600
meanwhile keeping like a dynamic

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.640
fulfilling sex life well that's some the

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.410
dynamic fulfilling sex life is the thing

01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:10.550
that's not gonna be said that goes

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:12.320
that's out yeah that's something I think

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.870
we need to come to terms with just I

01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:16.130
don't know that's what the weird thing

01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:17.420
is that everybody's on this kick

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:19.790
recently what in my opinion has been

01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:21.470
more like we need to find someone who

01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:23.390
you [ __ ] and it's so sick when you guys

01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:26.180
[ __ ] yeah that's weird you find someone

01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:28.670
that you can [ __ ] tolerate and raise

01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:31.070
a family with yeah and raise good kids

01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:32.570
with did I explain this to my BAE

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:33.950
recently I'm like dude it's like really

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:35.360
sad when I got married and realized I

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.920
wasn't gonna have sex with anyone else I

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.080
was like legitimately morning.that know

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.390
I was like deeply upset no you go [ __ ]

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:43.340
someone she was like that's well no she

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:44.900
was like sneak off dude she was like

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.910
that's [ __ ] up I'm like it's just not

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:48.500
dude it's not [ __ ] I like it part it

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.120
feels like a part of you just literally

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.430
dies when you're like alright I'm just

01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:54.230
sex with you forever I'd explain this to

01:15:54.230 --> 01:16:00.110
her and she was like she's Iraq smoked

01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:04.070
it out yeah I like I don't know why

01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:05.930
people don't mean again I obviously know

01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:07.130
why cuz I don't i think open

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:08.300
relationships are weird but i feel like

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:10.400

cooking I think really come I mean

01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:04.810

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:06.880
your girlfriend that sucks I think the

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.340
real like anger and deucing fear is the

01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.840
fact like you might have to raise

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:13.000

01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:21.210
you [ __ ] and then they poison all of

01:32:21.210 --> 01:32:22.409
them and you [ __ ] ride off then you

01:32:22.409 --> 01:32:23.909
ride off and then you get a letter ten

01:32:23.909 --> 01:32:25.889
years later from ancestry.com that was

01:32:25.889 --> 01:32:32.820
like oh our bad you really need a

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:34.650
weigh-in on apparently you're not you're

01:32:34.650 --> 01:32:36.210
not down for Shakespearean I would just

01:32:36.210 --> 01:32:38.340
I feel like no matter how you slice it

01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:40.440
in this situation you if you spent your

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:44.489
whole life trying to feed baby McNuggets

01:32:44.489 --> 01:32:54.020
to the wife I've seen you crush Nuggets

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:57.179
so is that you could use your cuck

01:32:57.179 --> 01:32:59.969
daughter or cook cook son to match on

01:32:59.969 --> 01:33:01.739
ancestry no it'll tell you who their

01:33:01.739 --> 01:33:03.270
relatives are and you could find their

01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:04.860
dad and then you could kill their dad

01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:07.469
yeah that seems like yeah I mean it's

01:33:07.469 --> 01:33:09.330
better instead of spending like 20 years

01:33:09.330 --> 01:33:12.750
raising a like a person that you're

01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:19.620
going to murder for planning that one

01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:22.110
guy's moved you can cook that hard

01:33:22.110 --> 01:33:23.340
though what else are you gonna do the

01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:25.020
discipline is a secret would you abandon

01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:26.550
your secretly if you found out you had a

01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:28.080

[ __ ] daughter who ends up being hot and

01:33:40.530 --> 01:33:44.070

01:35:53.090 --> 01:35:55.429
terms of like how worried were you going

01:35:55.429 --> 01:35:58.510
into this that you were gonna race

01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:04.160
anything is waiting like 30 or something

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:07.460
crazy no wait I'm telling you look it up

01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:11.810
I'll do I don't know how many girls are

01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:15.080
[ __ ] mmm what do you think that number

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.700
I would love to see some demographic

01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:18.410
breakdowns now what do you think that's

01:36:18.410 --> 01:36:24.560
me P girls do you think are raised and

01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:28.070
so how many probably 60% 60% are [ __ ]

01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:39.380
so yeah like stretches when I'm not

01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:41.150
talking to keep the bull now it looks

01:36:41.150 --> 01:36:46.070
good oh you got blood raising % of

01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:54.620
raising do my eye this is this is

01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:57.340
probably way too hot for the cast but oh

01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:00.830
my dad found out he had a sister through

01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:03.280
ancestry.com

01:37:03.610 --> 01:37:07.120
yeah like my grandfather had a kid like

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.340
I guess your grandfather had a secret

01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:12.430
kid yeah there's nothing wrong with that

01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:14.750
there is nothing that's not cooked I

01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:16.100
know that's not cooked but I'm just

01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:17.300
saying that now if he made your mom

01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:23.600
raise it somehow you know you could do

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.340
to cook your wife what time it perfectly

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.680
so you get another lady pregnant at the

01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:30.130
same time when your wife gives birth

01:37:30.130 --> 01:37:33.080
swap a room toss that kid out the fogger

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.480
lost the other boy straight out make her

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:37.370
raise this other son so you're gonna

01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:38.780
kill your own kid so you can raise your

01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:42.770
left that down there shifting off some

01:37:42.770 --> 01:37:45.020
of the circus well yeah yeah what if you

01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:46.340
just like good friends with the doctor

01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:48.020
and they were like it was like a you

01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:50.360
know very early on in the pregnancy they

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.460
like swapped it in vitro in vitro so

01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:54.050
it's knocked her out just be like I

01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:55.580
think it's best you know like you get

01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:57.230
him to tell her that it's like the best

01:37:57.230 --> 01:37:58.880
thing to do is for you to go under the

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.950
knife right now or just you know you

01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:02.960
know general anesthesia or whatever

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:03.890
these are all good moves

01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:06.380
yeah yeah put a little you know if you

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.930
had like an ugly wife that was a great

01:38:08.930 --> 01:38:10.039
person

01:38:10.039 --> 01:38:13.569
and you want to have a hotter kid right

01:38:13.569 --> 01:38:16.189
dude they're saying ugly and ugly

01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:20.749
creates greatness kid it's true

01:38:20.749 --> 01:38:23.559
I'm always just hoping for height yeah

01:38:23.559 --> 01:38:24.829
right

01:38:24.829 --> 01:38:27.319
yeah they're trying to say now it's I'm

01:38:27.319 --> 01:38:29.419
obsessed with height yeah now look I'm

01:38:29.419 --> 01:38:29.719
not

01:38:29.719 --> 01:38:32.179
you gotta dictate your life height are

01:38:32.179 --> 01:38:35.119
you think about it I obviously I don't

01:38:35.119 --> 01:38:37.159
but like you dude you don't know what it

01:38:37.159 --> 01:38:39.589
do like man you don't know it's like in

01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:41.149
a conversation to be looking up at

01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:45.469
people that you're the same to be

01:38:45.469 --> 01:38:47.059
looking up and like if they don't look

01:38:47.059 --> 01:38:54.619
down you never get to talk you never get

01:38:54.619 --> 01:39:02.539
to talk you gotta like if it's like in a

01:39:02.539 --> 01:39:05.569
loud situation like dude any time I was

01:39:05.569 --> 01:39:07.280
trying to talk to Sodor like when the

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:12.949
kid got even company I was gonna talk

01:39:12.949 --> 01:39:15.409
about that it's the worst feeling so my

01:39:15.409 --> 01:39:17.780
eyes yeah they hate that [ __ ] dude yeah

01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:19.159
when I'm when I'm above that's why you

01:39:19.159 --> 01:39:20.569
know whatever that's if you're sure all

01:39:20.569 --> 01:39:21.949
you do is I mean I do that if you're

01:39:21.949 --> 01:39:22.819
like talking to somebody said a

01:39:22.819 --> 01:39:28.579
constantly smack them yeah that's it

01:39:28.579 --> 01:39:28.819
yeah

01:39:28.819 --> 01:39:31.299
just nipping out listen to you yeah yeah

01:39:31.299 --> 01:39:33.169
think about that you know so they're

01:39:33.169 --> 01:39:35.179
saying it's basically there was people

01:39:35.179 --> 01:39:36.889
said there was 30 percent nine percent

01:39:36.889 --> 01:39:37.819
but they said they were due to small

01:39:37.819 --> 01:39:39.559
samples and I'm skimming this they're

01:39:39.559 --> 01:39:42.260
saying it's at least one 80% one thirty

01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:42.919
percent

01:39:42.919 --> 01:39:44.209
I mean it's population Julian's a

01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:46.429
[ __ ] [ __ ] card no there's one the

01:39:46.429 --> 01:39:48.649
same with a again this is just another

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:50.689
study population wide random sample DNA

01:39:50.689 --> 01:39:52.849
DNA testing it's like ethically unviable

01:39:52.849 --> 01:39:54.049
so they can't really do it but they're

01:39:54.049 --> 01:39:56.929
saying like it's probably at least like

01:39:56.929 --> 01:40:00.559
two percent or so of 250 million people

01:40:00.559 --> 01:40:03.139
yeah a lot of [ __ ] on so about 1 in 50

01:40:03.139 --> 01:40:04.309
but what neighborhoods do you think

01:40:04.309 --> 01:40:12.739
that's happening in right behavior yeah

01:40:12.739 --> 01:40:14.299
now what about the dad flying around on

01:40:14.299 --> 01:40:16.719
business a lot this is true this is true

01:40:16.719 --> 01:40:19.909

talking about

01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:25.739
people or not that's what you're saying

01:40:25.739 --> 01:40:28.320
sir I said yeah absolutely

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.770
what neighborhoods yeah the white

01:40:31.770 --> 01:40:32.880
neighborhoods you know what you're

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.590

01:40:34.590 --> 01:40:38.610
some places in Delco that I'm like poor

01:40:38.610 --> 01:40:43.619
problem you know it's a poor prize yeah

01:40:43.619 --> 01:40:45.510
I think it is no dude I think that

01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:48.079
happens to like the extremely wealthy I

01:40:48.079 --> 01:40:50.130
don't know sometimes the wife is too

01:40:50.130 --> 01:40:51.960
embarrassed to tell because that's our

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:54.840
only source of income you know poor

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:57.030
enough for it's like I need somebody

01:40:57.030 --> 01:41:00.900
around ya know this guy yeah I wonder if

01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:03.719
that happens the more of like the could

01:41:03.719 --> 01:41:06.119
be I just feel like I mean now again

01:41:06.119 --> 01:41:07.530
what is what are the rates of like

01:41:07.530 --> 01:41:09.780
alcohol consumption is it higher with

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:10.380
low income

01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:12.329
yeah for sure yes I would that I

01:41:12.329 --> 01:41:18.570
correlate getting cooked is a lot of

01:41:18.570 --> 01:41:20.579
booze alcohol deftly fuels the [ __ ]

01:41:20.579 --> 01:41:23.969
flames so yeah that's true if you were

01:41:23.969 --> 01:41:25.530
to run a multivariate analysis

01:41:25.530 --> 01:41:27.599
yeah chances of drink if your wife's out

01:41:27.599 --> 01:41:29.310
drinking your chances of being cooked

01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:31.829
are elevated by about three very high

01:41:31.829 --> 01:41:35.040
yeah yeah it's very why you lock the

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:38.820
silver bullets away lets you have a

01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:39.989
hundred percent chance of getting come

know you can be Jewish in secret how

01:44:50.710 --> 01:44:52.150
long it tends to be the most secretive

01:44:52.150 --> 01:44:58.360
ethnicity speaking of yeah what what

01:44:58.360 --> 01:44:59.890
about secret you don't think Oh Connie

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:06.820
a secret Jew dude no way irresponsible

01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:15.760
with money so funny by the way like

01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:18.910
whenever I tell like people about us and

01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:20.440
like argh I'm like oooh McCosker

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:31.170
McKeever O'Connor Scottish dudes

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:35.760
yeah Vaughn Celts dude yeah I need a

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:38.190
[ __ ] [ __ ]

01:45:38.190 --> 01:45:40.900
Connor are you worried about being calm

01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:42.430
worried about being honestly dude I'm

01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:43.930
trying to live a life where it's like if

01:45:43.930 --> 01:45:46.810
I'm even if I think that I'm with

01:45:46.810 --> 01:45:49.120
someone who's got that card in her deck

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:52.170
like she could play a cuck card I'm out

01:45:52.170 --> 01:45:55.570
hopefully I'm out you know I don't yeah

01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:57.760
I can't how do you determine whether or

01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:59.380
not you're just being paranoid pay close

01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:04.480
attention so what just yeah I don't know

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:07.510
I think you could tell yeah if someone

01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:09.190
has a [ __ ] card and if someone's crazy

01:46:09.190 --> 01:46:13.240
or not yeah some crazy dude this is

01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:17.650
crazy to one person talk some 1% of that

01:46:17.650 --> 01:46:20.680
again they did studies the samples they

01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:23.170
took or between 9 and 30% someone is

01:46:23.170 --> 01:46:25.000
like I don't believe this if you were to

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.640
do there's a population they did there

01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:29.380
was a study of a gynecologist they did

01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:30.700
like a DNA match with like their kids

01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:32.860
that one study they got 30 percent but

01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:34.240
again that could have been the sample

01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.530
they did another one they got like

01:46:35.530 --> 01:46:37.630
around nine but then there's this guy

01:46:37.630 --> 01:46:39.430
saying like well you know they're just a

01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:40.870
small sample if you were to do it it

01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:42.400
would probably be around this so they

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:43.690
didn't they they're like we can't do

01:46:43.690 --> 01:46:45.820
like humans like well look at the

01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:48.640
households it's probably 1% you think

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:49.900
you know I mean he was probably this is

01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:51.340
probably a poor Planned Parenthood

01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:54.610
that's doing this yeah yeah yeah they're

01:46:54.610 --> 01:46:57.059
gonna be sampling majority of people are

01:46:57.059 --> 01:46:59.290
that last time this was probably they're

01:46:59.290 --> 01:47:02.980
not sampling the whites probably we're

01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:04.719
so honorable it probably knocks that 30

01:47:04.719 --> 01:47:08.320
percent down to about one [ __ ] hard

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:11.409
[ __ ] [ __ ] belt dude there's no [ __ ]

01:47:11.409 --> 01:47:13.719
belt dude down to something if someone

01:47:13.719 --> 01:47:15.520
got pregnant if a woman got pregnant

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:19.030
from another dude yeah and didn't abort

01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:24.550

realistic approach to our lifelong

01:48:32.770 --> 01:48:34.659

say you have a girlfriend that you just

01:48:54.610 --> 01:48:55.719

01:49:05.710 --> 01:49:06.969
you having to work you'd have to give

01:49:06.969 --> 01:49:08.290
something up your girlfriend would have

01:49:08.290 --> 01:49:09.429
to be able to get something else from

01:53:51.730 --> 01:53:53.560

in like like she's like you're a [ __ ]

01:53:58.030 --> 01:53:59.530

double-team refer did you make it until

01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:10.120
the double teaming oh no I waited no I

01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:13.830
waited I skipped until right before the

01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:16.030
orals you started jerking off and like

01:54:16.030 --> 01:54:18.970
the joyous return yes yeah yeah that's

01:54:18.970 --> 01:54:21.880
nice yeah that's weird that's weird of

01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:24.490
you why to attach those like morals to

01:54:24.490 --> 01:54:26.260
it I don't know if it's moral thing it's

01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:28.120
just like I just don't like the

01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:33.250
antagonist yeah yeah well that's what I

01:54:33.250 --> 01:54:34.570
was telling you that like a problem

01:54:34.570 --> 01:54:37.510
watching like gay porn just because like

01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:40.090
I like the idea of a dude getting it's

01:54:40.090 --> 01:54:42.460
just like it feels like someone's losing

01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:45.730
something ice-locked it's just like come

01:54:45.730 --> 01:54:49.090
on man you let that guy get you like

01:54:49.090 --> 01:54:51.550
that talk to watch man I think that's

01:54:51.550 --> 01:54:54.100
why I would like yeah that I would could

01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:55.810
never let that happen I would love to

01:54:55.810 --> 01:54:57.730
see why you could never let I would

01:54:57.730 --> 01:55:00.640
never be I would never like get [ __ ]

01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:02.650
even if as much as I open my mind to the

01:55:02.650 --> 01:55:04.360
idea that it could be liking it like

01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:13.870
essentially enjoy around like I can

01:55:13.870 --> 01:55:15.280
understand how central it would be to

01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:17.560
let another man even if I could get to

01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:20.110
that place that the larger hurdle would

01:55:20.110 --> 01:55:22.300
be like but it'd be like getting dunked

01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:24.580
on to me it is like posterizing someone

01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:26.980
getting [ __ ] in the ass yeah that's

01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:30.250
the ultimate I mean there's I've talked

01:55:30.250 --> 01:55:32.230
about before there's a stream lack of

01:55:32.230 --> 01:55:33.510

these a real problem broke I remember it

01:59:54.619 --> 01:59:55.969

01:59:55.969 --> 01:59:57.439
like I don't even care anymore and I

01:59:57.439 --> 01:59:59.059

weren't you doing yard work

02:00:01.939 --> 02:00:04.570
I was mulching

02:00:05.489 --> 02:00:07.110
it's basically this is the same

02:00:07.110 --> 02:00:09.090
experience of every landscaper in the

02:00:09.090 --> 02:00:10.710
world you just dump wheelbarrow no I

02:00:10.710 --> 02:00:11.760
don't even give a [ __ ] if you [ __ ]

02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:14.700
someone else you go back everyone that

02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:16.860
is that is what needs to happen if

02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:18.180
you're gonna if you're gonna live on the

02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:20.160
edge like that and date Ahuja you need

02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:22.380
to just be like whatever happens that

02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:23.460
it's like being on the plane when it

02:00:23.460 --> 02:00:25.320
starts turbulence kicks I feel like if

02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:27.320
I'm gonna die I'm gonna die

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:29.880
similar [ __ ] it yeah if you get an

02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:31.680
earring and like a real sick like like

02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:33.270
button-down Hawaiian wardrobe you can

02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:37.850
pull it off you're like wow I don't

02:00:38.090 --> 02:00:40.680
dress like a Crocodile Hunter dude you

02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:42.000
can definitely absorb a [ __ ] a lot

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:42.989
better I don't know if you guys have

02:00:42.989 --> 02:00:45.239
covered this already but I think that

02:00:45.239 --> 02:00:46.560
all three of them I don't know your

02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.660
dating history very well but I think all

02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:50.640
three of us have a slight case of the

02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:54.630
women just choosing us won't you speak

02:00:54.630 --> 02:00:58.020
for yourself I think really that [ __ ] it

02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:00.210
what do you mean like that point more so

02:01:00.210 --> 02:01:00.690
poignant

02:01:00.690 --> 02:01:02.130

02:01:02.130 --> 02:01:03.780
relationships that you got or at times

02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:05.160

most of the pedophilia and all these sex

02:07:45.749 --> 02:07:47.429
scandals stem from the fact that the

02:07:47.429 --> 02:07:48.920
church is pretty much all homosexuals

02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:52.079
