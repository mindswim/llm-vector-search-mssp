between where we were at in the business

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.120

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.100
you think he's on testosterone no I

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.300
think it's all natural he's all natural

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.279
yeah you think that's all match oh I

00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:28.820
have no doubt true why

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.040
if you're being a smart ass I'm not sure

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.860
yeah I think you think games on test no

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.420
I don't know probably doesn't seem like

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.100
somebody who would use anything

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.079
artificial to improve his looks

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.500
um

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.300
yeah I don't know what those guys I mean

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.779
it's it's such rapid changes between

00:15:48.779 --> 00:15:51.000
especially with the you know like the

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.980
guys that are in the movies it's such

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.199
rapid changes between body type it

00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:57.120
happens so quickly it's kind of like

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.519
it's hard to think you and look no

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:00.959
judgment do whatever the [ __ ] I don't

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:03.139
care yeah but it's kind of hard

00:16:03.139 --> 00:16:06.120
exactly do the [ __ ] stairways take

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.220
steroids yeah I don't give a [ __ ] well

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.040
it's it's fair and no not if it's like a

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.420
contact sport

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.920
like if you're playing football or

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.440
boxing or UFC don't that's [ __ ] up if

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.360
you take steroids why because then

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.680
you're it's an unfair Advantage you're

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.720
literally you can hurt someone

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.759
you know what I mean all it does is

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:26.040
change your muscles though right well no

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.259
it fires you up dude it'd be like

00:16:28.259 --> 00:16:29.220
someone

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.259
you know taking like PCP before the

00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:33.000
fight the increases are just jacked and

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.380
I wouldn't give a rat's ass if a

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.940
football player was doing blood I mean

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.560
plenty of them have have done blow on

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.360
the field I mean I don't know man I I

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.519
hear you in theory what you're saying I

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:42.959
just don't know but if other guys are

00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:45.060
following the rules if one guy takes

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.399
steroids in like UFC it's like it's an

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:48.600
unfair fight

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.579
if the other guy those guys are juicing

00:16:50.579 --> 00:16:53.100
they were they were pretty hard it's a

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.300
big Advantage it's a huge Advantage

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.399
right I took I'm all natural right now

00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:58.259
yeah I would take roids I could probably

00:16:58.259 --> 00:17:00.660
I'd probably be like 220 just [ __ ]

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.600
jacked I guess I just don't care I have

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.880
no dog in the fight you know yeah well

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.199
then why'd you say that opinion first

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:08.699
that was wrong

00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:10.980
what's that you see oh I guess I don't

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.780
care after you've you've no I said it

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.339
you've been pinned to the ground in the

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.199
argument and then you're like actually I

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:18.059
led with I said I said I don't care

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:19.919
about sports either if they do steroids

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:21.539

um yeah no I have a ton of I have a ton

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.400
of systems at home damn yeah what are

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.880
you gaming on right now Xbox series X

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.059
playing a Resident Evil Village a new

00:21:48.059 --> 00:21:50.640
one I got the new Xbox series X it

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.140
doesn't it's pretty great it's kind of

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.140
useless no it's not dude

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.340
these systems there's no games that are

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.600
out for here's what here's the deal

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.700
though this is what's about to happen

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.520
they just announced all this at E3

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.500
so they it was a kind of a weak launch

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.659
for both systems you know the newer the

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:08.280
systems get the weaker the launches get

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.659
because

00:22:09.659 --> 00:22:11.820
there's it just takes more time I guess

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.559
for developers to make stuff for the new

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:16.140
systems so this was a week launch for

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.140
both systems but here's the thing Xbox

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.840
announced that E3 they showed all the

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.520
new games coming out exclusively for

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.919
Xbox and that most of them are going to

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:28.020
be available Day One on Game Pass

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.299
they're making Game Pass like their

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:31.860

flea market they were selling high

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.720
pressure BB guns I was like I guess you

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.279
could in theory defend your home with

00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:16.140
one of those yeah you fired on someone

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.760
they'd you know I think that's a Bill

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.340
Burr bit is it really

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.899
oh is it really

00:29:21.899 --> 00:29:24.720
is that a bit I'm not doing a bit I'm

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.080
asking

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:30.200
is it

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.880
really

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.440
is it really a bird oh [ __ ] I forgot

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.179
about that yeah I think he does that

00:29:36.179 --> 00:29:38.220

00:29:39.659 --> 00:29:41.100
really actually parallel thinking I'm

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.779
answering right yes I believe he does

00:29:42.779 --> 00:29:44.039
have a bit like that I understand I

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:45.000
think it's like you could shoot someone

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.559
in the elbow and they'd have to leave or

00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:47.840
something like that

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.640
no no but could you I'm really

Hollywood made all like all Races and

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.440
entertainment is because of Hollywood

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.480
and then yeah now they're like canceling

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.799

the Scorsese did a docu series about

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.740
Fran Leibowitz the author oh and she

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.359
said in that she goes look you know she

00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:40.320
goes I'm not saying any of this

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.820
Hollywood stuff is right but you don't

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.619
have to be an actor

00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:44.880
you know I feel bad there's a girl

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.800
saying this yeah a woman and she goes I

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.300
feel bad for the chamber Maids that

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.099
nobody's talking about that's a job that

00:35:50.099 --> 00:35:52.140
they have to do she's like this is

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.900
Hollywood it's not right it's not okay

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.460
it's gross but you don't have to

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.320
nobody's forced to be an actor people

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.420
are forced to be a maid and then this

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.680
happens to them and I thought it was a

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.839
really insightful point I don't know I

00:36:03.839 --> 00:36:05.640
don't think I don't think it does it

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.140
doesn't matter what your job is sexual

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.000
assault is sexual assault Joe

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.859
you're so smart dude you're so

00:36:10.859 --> 00:36:13.800
insightful what about like this role

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.839
yeah like being like you can't do this

00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:17.880
role unless you blow me and they were

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.500
they they wanted oh that's [ __ ] up I'm

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.760
not saying it's not [ __ ] up but at the

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.900
same time it's like the fact that

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.280
they're not talking about the women

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.500
they're whose backs are literally to the

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.660
wall they have to do that job if I was a

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.280
girl that happened to me if I was a girl

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.780
and it happened to me I'd end up and I'm

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:31.980
not bullshitting I would end up probably

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.079
being the director eventually

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:37.079
so Kick-Ass dude I'll just find a way I

00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:38.280
wouldn't yeah I would just be like I was

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.359
just thinking about it I'm not shoveling

00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:40.980
on the way here really yeah it's funny

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.180

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.099

looks awesome that's the most excited

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.320
airport but the reason I was thinking

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.660
about it was because

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.740
a24 is due for a dud

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.079

whoa what I liked about it was it was uh

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.160
my favorite part about mid-summer was

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.980
when they cgi'd the young guy

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.960
they put a 90 year old and pretended he

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.060
was 20. the whole movie and made it five

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.260

favorite part is what you liked about me

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.000
them talk uh just gibberish I liked when

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.619
they literally had one of the characters

00:41:49.619 --> 00:41:51.839
[ __ ] up a line and they thought they

00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:53.940
were so incredible at art that they just

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.099
kept it true what part was that in

00:41:56.099 --> 00:42:00.000
mid-summer when uh Pacino is uh

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.339

00:42:37.319 --> 00:42:39.000

they're like we don't know if it came

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.099
from the lab they're like well you won't

00:43:41.099 --> 00:43:42.480

it's not even a thing it's like but then

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.819
they're like it did come from a lab so

00:43:56.819 --> 00:43:59.339
it is a thing it came from a lab and it

00:43:59.339 --> 00:44:02.660
was funded by the guy who was like yeah

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.280
yeah

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.240

to be the case but that's how I took it

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.680
she was shoulder eels is all I remember

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.000

little chubby blonde dude she was then

00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.760

all my friends he sat there and I

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.980

oh you know what I mean like the inner

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.480
monologue while she's like

00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:00.240
I was like what the hell is this I

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.980
remember crying and running upstairs

what was your punishment for the porno

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.880
uh I don't think I got punished either

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.460
the worst trouble I got in was when

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:35.700
we uh we're at my cousin's house and my

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.160
aunt and uncle and parents left us alone

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.200
and we were watching Batman on VHS and

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.880
this is back when VHS kind of cost a lot

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:42.720
of money

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.319
um

00:55:43.319 --> 00:55:46.920
and his dad was like kind of like

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.079
not bragging but like proud that he had

00:55:49.079 --> 00:55:51.240
bought like this Blockbuster movie on

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.359
VHS and it was in the VCR and then they

00:55:54.359 --> 00:55:56.339

something normal yeah it wasn't anything

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.319
weird and then we went and put Batman

00:56:13.319 --> 00:56:16.260
back into the VCR and it got stuck and

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:17.940

the porno we put it back already okay

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:32.579
but still so so this guy was fired up

00:56:32.579 --> 00:56:34.799
about Batman so we were like so [ __ ]

00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:36.720

00:56:45.059 --> 00:56:46.859
just we just tweaked we took Batman out

00:56:46.859 --> 00:56:48.839
for a second and it ripped and he's like

00:56:48.839 --> 00:56:50.579
why'd you take Batman out right he was

00:56:50.579 --> 00:56:52.319
hammering him about why he took Batman

00:56:52.319 --> 00:56:56.460
out and I was so scared and then we were

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.680
I was driving nothing happened like it

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.660
was just the tape what was the story you

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:01.980
guys are [ __ ] we just said we took

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.180
it out for a second to watch something

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.740
else and changed our minds it was like

00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:07.500
some lie but whatever so then

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.420
but I was convinced we were but you

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.799
can't accuse you he can't be like we

00:57:10.799 --> 00:57:12.599
could take it out to watch porn yeah he

00:57:12.599 --> 00:57:15.119
had no problem watching my porno we were

00:57:15.119 --> 00:57:17.640
in the clear but I was so scared and so

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.740
paranoid as a kid we were driving home

00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:23.160
and I just cracked to my parents I

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.839
started crying and I was like I'm so

00:57:24.839 --> 00:57:26.400
sorry we were trying to watch a porno

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.520
movie

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.559
oh man and then she called my mom got

00:57:31.559 --> 00:57:35.700
home and told him what we did

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.740
I think I heard my cousin getting beat

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:41.700
over the phone oh no and uh and then

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:44.339
like my parents yelled at me but I don't

00:57:44.339 --> 00:57:45.900
think I got grounded I think they were

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:47.400
like you told the truth so we're gonna

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.440
let it go like one of those things

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.000
yeah your mom probably called like

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.140
laughing

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:54.660
no she was not laughing really I don't

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:56.220
know if she was she was probably mad

00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:58.020
that they put her face on for me maybe

00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:59.880
maybe probably had porno laying around

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.680
it wasn't laying around we went in this

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.780
we found it when he knew where I know

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.819
most people but still I know moms are

00:58:05.819 --> 00:58:06.960
different now that was like a

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.339
multi-dimensional problem you're right

00:58:08.339 --> 00:58:10.559
back then dudes like legitimately hid

00:58:10.559 --> 00:58:12.240
their porn from their wives yeah no it

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.040
was it was it was in a hiding place but

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.079
because my cousin just knew where it was

00:58:16.079 --> 00:58:18.000
he's like a truffle pig he sniffed that

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.520
up right out that's what we all did when

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.540
we were kids we all knew where the

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:23.460
hiding places for porn was the worst is

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.440
when they moved the hiding spot

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.599
my one friend had his parents were in

00:58:27.599 --> 00:58:30.180
their closet and then one day we went

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:31.559
