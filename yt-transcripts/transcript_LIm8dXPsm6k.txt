00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.520
somebody could the best is thinking

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.960
about people who stumble across this on

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.280
the internet which is like no context

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.800
and they're just like what the [ __ ]

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.799

the mayor we got lemaire in the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.159
[ __ ]

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.840
we can't see him which is weird we need

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.680
to get another monitor this is uh this

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.600
is a pretty crazy experiment we're

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.040
running right now yeah this is we could

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.479
lose funding over there we could we

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.080
could we went straight to human trials

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.759
on the tomb we should have had it we

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.439
should have some of the monkey in there

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.840
first

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.400
this is a good like halfway point don't

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.119
be racist in the comments yeah yeah yeah

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.119
don't be racist in the comments

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.720
we'll do it yeah we'll handle the race

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.400
listen here do not leave a comment

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.400
saying that this is like halfway between

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.159
a monkey and a given trial i don't think

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.520
that that would be a funny joke for you

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.520
to make in the comments i would be

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.960
[ __ ] furious i might take the channel

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.880
down if somebody got it it's over i'll

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.560
report this channel i'll report the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.320

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.159

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.120
sucking trump

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.960
directly proportional the theatrics that

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.800
they're doing yeah dude is directly

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.160

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.040
[Laughter]

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.399
he's just like fighting at the air

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.560
you sneak out here's 50 cc's of shake

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.720
shack

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.720
we'd have to step them up to like shake

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.399
shack if someone discovers them they're

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:40.800
like we have to tell people about this

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.240
we're going to kill somebody to protect

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.040
lemaire his dark secret shake shack is

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.120
like fast food methadone like you eat

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.200
that before you evolve to good food so

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.120
chipotle's like chipotle's quickly

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.000
becoming oxycontin of fast food

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.240
gets worse every time i eat chipotle i'm

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.080
like man that was way worse than last

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.320
time guacamole is the fentanyl of fast

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.839
food it's starting to like pop

00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:05.120
up i have a theory that chipotle's

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.200
guacamole is just like mcdonald's old

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.320
milkshake

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.320
repurposed i think they just like take

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.120
old mcdonald's food and just alchemy

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.680
into like yeah chipotle guacamole dude

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.880
it's not i eat a lot of and chipotle

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.519
guacamole is like

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:21.120
grainy it's mixed produce yeah that's

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.120
the idea i stopped getting it they

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.560
figured out yeah they thought i thought

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.720
it was ultra high quality i thought so

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.640
too dude if you ask me what i think it

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.399
might be the i think i think it might be

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:32.240
like the top of the game well the

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.000
mayor's right if you're do you eat fast

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.920
food though

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.279
not a ton

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.440
silence le mayo

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.399
no i don't think that's getting your

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:41.839
whole life

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:44.560
so yeah that's fast that's from an

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.320
economics perspective tim's kind of

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.399
right what because mcdonald's has

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:50.560
something called a monopsony right where

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.160
they're like the biggest buyer of

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.040
something yeah so they get quite they

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.600
actually get quality meat

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.480
so because they probably own the farms

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.800
and things they're probably getting like

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.959
the best grade avocado they get the

00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:07.200
first choice no way they get the first

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.760
choice of the worst [ __ ] folgers does

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.800
this

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.000
folgers they have the same thing i

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.360
didn't know it's called a monopsome i'm

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.640
definitely gonna yeah

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.680
now we're now that we're talking

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.959
monopolies i think i've heard four

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:20.160
different investigations

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:28.480
yeah okay yeah monopsony yeah we're

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.279
getting enopsany

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.839
but yeah i've heard lemare how do you

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:36.720
pronounce it monopsony

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.760
let's go let's go

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.200
yeah but we're not playing

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:52.480
[Laughter]

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.240
so the whole point was that mcdonald's

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.279
gets the best stuff i highly doubt that

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:59.360
mcdonald's is getting the best of like

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.839
cows that have been like living under a

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:02.800
floor

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.760
for like

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.279
40 years

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:07.760
they like they like grow cows without

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.060
heads

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:18.550
[Laughter]

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:24.240
they're in like the level 200 of the

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.959
luhan lab

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:29.279
you take the elevator to floor two of

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:30.320
the it's

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.399
woohan institute of our algae it's just

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:35.600
mcdonald's meat farm

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.360
they gotta like kill the manager every

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.839
six months

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:42.480
that's just making it sound more

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.200
delicious oh my god true meat bushes

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.560
they get the first pick of the meat

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.560
pushes boutique meat

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.839
yeah like if matilda was in like a

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:52.079
wolverine tank her whole life and then

00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:54.000
we ate her she would be delicious you're

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.079
right yeah

00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:57.680
what what if they're like there's like

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.440
italian dressing in the

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.120

him in the head with a thing or just so

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.880
mcdonald's as a corporation is

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.680
constantly fleecing franchise owners

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.600
out of maintenance fees for the

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.760
milkshake machines for the ice the the

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.200
soft serve machines

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.279
hold up what yeah yeah yeah so they they

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:36.480
have these soft serve machines in

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.560
mcdonald's and they're always broken

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.199
right you could imagine and

00:13:41.199 --> 00:13:43.279
so they're they're like mcdonald's

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:45.760
they're mcdonald's own like like if

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.279
you're franchising a mcdonald's you have

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:49.040
to use mcdonald's

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.320
soft-serve machines you can't use

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.920
another so

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.000
the they're constantly breaking down and

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.560
then the people that come to fix it are

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.199
they're also they work for mcdonald's

00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:00.000
court

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.120
right so they get paid for fixing it and

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.959
like they have mcdonald's mechanics

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:10.800

if any of us go to jail we'll get an

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:16.079
enhanced sentence

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:17.680
because we're affiliated with this is

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.680
gang activity now

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.120
and the [ __ ] making a company dude

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.480
we're fully into the underworld we're a

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.560
gang

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.800
we're gonna hit the gray market hard oh

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.800

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.920
service on ice cream machines

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.360
that was the company that was doing that

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.000
what yeah mcdonald's [ __ ] sued him so

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.680
the company a company realized that this

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.560
was there was a flaw so they built an

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.480
app to detect what exactly was wrong

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.920
with it because they they have these

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.480
ridiculous manuals and you can't it's

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.480
hard to diagnose what's wrong with

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.399
people who work at mcdonald's can't read

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:52.639
yeah yeah

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:54.240
it's actually a pretty simple pamphlet

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.320
but none of them have read it so a guy

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.120
made an app that just like explains it

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.160
to be fair it is it's like mostly 14

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.600
year olds yeah

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.039
they haven't got done learning how to

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:06.880
read

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.079
mcdonald's

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.319
mcdonald's mcdonald's thing could be in

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:13.760
like shakespearean like yo

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.439
it's written in iambic pentameter

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:18.959
damn it was written in [ __ ] like in

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:21.360
the ye old gears

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.480
if they have failed to were

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.520
summoner

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.079
authorized representative

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.360
someone i

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.720
if thou summoneth a man from the woods

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.720
we will come down upon thee swiftly and

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.400
mightily

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.440
yeah that's probably what happened

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.520
yeah so

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.080
so basically that's happening and then

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.440
uh sorry i'm thinking about that

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.440
mcdonald's [ __ ]

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.150
about to play 432.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:56.420
[Laughter]

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:58.000
no that's not sorry sorry sorry i

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.679
apologize yeah so this company built

00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:01.840
this tv right that just tells you what's

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.760
wrong with it and then you can fix it

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.960
and they also tell you how to fix it

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.840
yourself

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.919
right right but when that was happening

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:10.080
now mcdonald's isn't making money for

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.720
the maintenance fees so they sued this

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.039
company that's a [ __ ] problem yeah

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:16.720
now now i'm at the shareholder meeting

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.799
i'm going what the [ __ ]

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:21.520
who the [ __ ] is this

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.120
that was the perfect plan

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.840
boiled by an arabian teenager yeah

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.080
they were actually gay white men really

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.240
yeah two well flamboyant flamboyant

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.360
white they they might not be i don't

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.799
know if they're stuck there

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:38.320
gay guys would run a tech company

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.080
because usually it's all about grabbing

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.080

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.160
of the coin yeah that's just yeah

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.600
that's just rough and that's that's

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.720
that's when it becomes rough and tumble

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.600
play

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.360

oh that's why they have two pilots

00:22:55.679 --> 00:22:57.120
that's why they have two pilots so if

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.720
someone sucks the one pilot you get to

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.360

sitting in your station

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.919

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:15.760
helicopter oh there's a pocket of gay

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.400
airspace i thought about it

either that was the marriage

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.840
i felt

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.360
dude imagine if kobe's helicopter

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.559
crashed because they flew over gay

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:25.919
airspace and he started sucking a

00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:27.120
helicopter pilot in front of his

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.640
daughter mac you play the music i'm

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.120

here and like insult his hero like this

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.559
yeah i don't think that's funny by the

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:42.080
way i'm just saying if someone made that

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.240
comment yeah in the youtube comments

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.600
that would not be the thing i'm thinking

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.320
is so funny but it's tragic dude it's so

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.559
bad

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.039
know what you do like like speak it out

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:57.120
to you out of you into butterley

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.440
all right i was lemaire close your ears

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.600
um

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.799
that's why he shielded himself

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:06.240
young maidens

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.159
to ward off just kobe

00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:09.760
to prevail himself yeah i'm not i've

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.360
told you it's [ __ ] up

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.120
yeah it's [ __ ] up a man in his family

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.640
died dude

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.159
it's terrible

00:24:16.159 --> 00:24:18.000
i'm ashamed that things like this pop

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.440
into my [ __ ] brain dude i'm sick

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.760
i'm [ __ ] sick dude the fact that in

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.799
my head

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:26.000
i thought what you were going to say and

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.039
i was like

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:28.400
and then all of a sudden it was like the

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.000
next level no yeah stop wow so you you

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.679
is this a thing that you read and that

00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:35.600
you believe now or is this just your

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.880
invention what that kobe was gay no he

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.960
wasn't gay i'm saying he was protecting

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.320
himself as a pilot might have been gay

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.600
and if a pilot's gay it's a [ __ ]

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.640
problem that's why they only let

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.559
stewards and stewardesses be gay

00:24:46.559 --> 00:24:48.000
because they're they've got to keep they

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.200
kept that's why the air locks on the

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.440
door you got to keep those one time okay

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.960
one time i had a flight that was delayed

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.960
i might have told this story today i

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.700
don't know

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.219
[Music]

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.799
we were stuck on the on the runway for

00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:06.480
like two hours we were delayed and it

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.320
was because our flight attendants never

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.679
showed up

00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:11.679
and they couldn't they just replaced

00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:13.039
them we had to wait for these guys to

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:15.120
come back from the hotel

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.760
and they told us that

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.960
or maybe it was a rumor that made its

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.080
way onto the plane but they were like

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.360
the flight attendants overslept they're

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.799
just not here yet we're waiting for them

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.159
so we're waiting and waiting waiting

00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:25.360
finally these flight attendants show up

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.840
and it's two gay

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.159
guys bro

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:29.360
they delayed my flight because they were

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.960
sucking you know what's so funny i

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.640
missed the first like

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.720
eighty percent of that story looking at

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.159
432 homes

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:36.960
but

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.799
i only needed the last four sentences

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:40.159
yeah of like and we were waiting and it

00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:43.440
was too gay airplane guys i was like

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.600
i know what everyone was thinking

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.880
well so here's the [ __ ] up thing is

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.840
like

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.760
now i'm thinking of like the amount of

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.279
thoughts people filter it's pretty

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:54.240
terrifying mm-hmm like the levels beyond

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.000
like we were in a forbidden thought

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.320
territory very we entered a very taboo

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.000
space yeah so you know how like your

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.840
first impulse your first reaction to

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.360
almost anything that happens is the

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.400
worst possible reaction

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.440
yeah i thought i was thinking about

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.000
keeping a nego journal of just those

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.960
just my

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.880
just the worst

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.720
that's your shadow dude enter my head

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.799
you're doing d that's your shadow yeah

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:18.640
you'd capture your phone i'm creating a

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.000
shadow journal are you prepared to face

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.159
it dude

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:23.679
damn that's dude because that's what i'm

00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:25.279
bugging out on right now like that's

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:27.440
like love tier one

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.840
taboo there's like two or like four

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.159
taboos that we that's like so [ __ ] up

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:33.919
when you lock it up you have to iterate

00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:35.840
you have to iterate the bad impulse over

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.480
and over again to reach lower levels

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.520
yeah that's why i have to say it like in

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.960
a mirror three times

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.440
yeah tier four is fighting yourself

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.200
negative

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.880
what what you're gonna have to fight

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.559
negative dude dude stop being racist

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.600
that was another one i blocked out

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.640
tim's gonna fight [ __ ] too

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.960
but it's just

00:27:13.039 --> 00:27:15.120
oh my god

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.240
holy [ __ ] dude oh my god

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.640
the dynamic just totally shifted

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.320
the dynamic might have shifted forever

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.760
damn

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.520
i'm still bugging out about the things

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.480
i'm keeping a great glug oh yeah

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.919
i'm still bugging out on the things we

00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:33.919
all keep from ourselves how there's a

00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:37.200
world of [ __ ] thoughts that just like

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.039
fade just that you think about it you're

00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:40.640
like oh my god if they knew that they

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.880
would never talk to me ever again

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.640
there's it's there's that in a lot of

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.640
romantic relationships there's always a

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.000
like yeah if i said that this whole

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.679
thing would crumble

00:27:49.679 --> 00:27:52.000
yeah the the nuclear option there's the

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.760
new you gotta it's it's there it's

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.600
[ __ ] it's lava beneath the surface

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.640
and you have to go do you have to

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.159
believe the the terrible thing that

00:27:58.159 --> 00:27:59.600
you're gonna say or you're just like oh

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.760
i've identified the ultimate weapon you

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.440
know

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.880
i mean my quest is over i think

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.600
three physicists quit over the lack of

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.360
effort

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.520
dude the nuclear bomb there is a nuclear

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.440
everyone has a nuclear weakness that you

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.480
could just be like

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.799
tap into and it would just go you you're

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:20.320
walking in the woods and you see the

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.480
words fat [ __ ] sticking out of a rock

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.520
and you like pull it out you're like

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.720
this is the ultimate argument

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.340
ultimately slay

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.840
[Laughter]

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.360
wow

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.039
i gotta get out of my subconscious

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:36.559
what's wrong with it

00:28:36.559 --> 00:28:38.480
dude i'm fine you gotta do this it's

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.320
just terrifying to think about myself

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.760
every night before bed what thinking

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.279
about stuff outside of your awareness

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:45.440
yeah that's what keeps me up you know

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.799
it's like i gotta [ __ ] get through

00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:48.240
all of this i'm not going to sleep with

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.399
this [ __ ] dude there's stuff that you've

00:28:50.399 --> 00:28:52.640
thought of or experienced and your brain

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.600
just went nope not keeping that

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.440
it's gone forever oh it's still there

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.120
yeah it's pretty [ __ ] up to think

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.000
about

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.520
well you wouldn't know if your brain if

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.960
your brain had a function where it could

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.520
wipe a memory you wouldn't know

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.799
it would be protecting you from yourself

00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:08.640
but here's the problem yes go ahead it

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.559
is that's the who knows who knows if

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:11.919
what's happened what happened this

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:14.240
happens to a lot of war vets they

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.919
repress a memory but it's still their

00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:18.240
nervous system is still processing that

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.360
memory

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.720
right you'll get a guy who will do like

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.200
a because your body is aware of you so

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.200
i'll i'll share one i'll share one right

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.799
so when i was in middle school and i was

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:28.640
living like at my grandmom's house my

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.320
mom was like away on drugs and she was

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.679
always like a problem up until that

00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:34.159
point and uh you know sometimes i would

00:29:34.159 --> 00:29:35.520
like what was your diet like at that

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.559
time

00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:38.399
dude uh i've worked really hard to eat a

00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:40.799
healthy diet my whole entire life sure

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:51.440
she was on a cruise

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.240
she was on a chevy cruze

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.660
i just pulled a stomach muscle

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.640
[Laughter]

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.640

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.520
that's like that's how you know it's

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.760
time

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.159
sorry yeah but she was a problem she was

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:09.919
always a problem it was always chaotic

00:30:09.919 --> 00:30:10.799
yeah and i'm living with my

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:12.159
grandmother's house and it's still like

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:13.760
even though she was in coastal i was in

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.919
potstown even with that distance it was

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:18.559
still a problem and sometimes i'll lay

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.240
at night thinking like how much easier

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.640
life would be if she just died yeah sure

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.720
you know and it's like

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.720
yeah yeah i've had those for anyone i've

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.919
ever worked for

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:29.600
anytime they're five minutes late i'm

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.399
like

00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:32.399
i wonder if their [ __ ] car exploded

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:35.279
yeah and i'm like

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.440
i would be at get to children i mean it

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.799
would be sad don't get me wrong be

00:30:38.799 --> 00:30:40.880
terrified it'd be terrible but i would

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.399
get to children you're getting a day off

00:30:42.399 --> 00:30:43.600
because the person that you work with

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.520
every day died

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.679
that's sick that's awesome

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:49.039
yeah we can come on the record and say

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:50.480
that rules that would be pretty good

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.840
dude someone that like considers you

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.360
kind of a friend you're just like dude

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.880
it would rule if you died

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.679
go home early

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.600
so much i hated every job i've ever had

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.880
i'd always been like

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.880
i mean if this truck did flip it'd be

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.279
sad but yeah leaving the home depot

00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:09.039
parking lot at 7am would be sweet

00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:12.559
i'm not gonna get done until 3 30.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.799
i'm outsold outside in the parking lot

00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:17.120
freezing waiting for this guy yeah but

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.200
then i like then i actually experienced

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.480
the death of somebody close to me and i

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.360
was like i don't know what just happened

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.919
to my mom true yeah it switched it

00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:25.519
switched yeah

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:27.919
that's also a fair thing to leave you or

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:28.799
do i don't know if that's a thing i

00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:30.559
think so i think it's a fair thing to

00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:33.039
toss across the dam to be like [ __ ]

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:33.760
yeah

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.440
do you remember do you remember having a

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.519
fear of wishing someone was dead and

00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:39.120
then they die like that was like a

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.880
common thing right yeah dude i had this

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.720
i had to stop fantasizing that's what

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.080
you were trying to bully with your mom

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.279
well i mean i was actually trying to

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:46.960
avoid this with another guy this this

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.840
guy uh when i was in kindergarten uh i

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.159
used to go hang out by myself

00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:54.960
against this like still great fence just

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.880
chill there just like do a little [ __ ]

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.120
that sad

00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:04.240
well

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.919
from a tactical perspective it gave you

00:32:05.919 --> 00:32:07.279
the lay of the horse sure no it's

00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:09.120
fantastic it's so sick i'm just like i

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.640
mean i would like that like hey you're

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.480
right this is my down time because like

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.559
i recessed hard we didn't have phones

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:16.559
too back then yeah no that's true at all

00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:18.480
so i wouldn't go in alpha [ __ ] dude i

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.000
would play a game until i couldn't walk

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.919
anymore and then i'd go over and just

00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:23.919
chill there until recess was over or

00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:25.919
until i built up enough stamina to get

00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:27.200
back in whatever game i didn't know this

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.480
was recess i thought you were just doing

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.399
this at like 4pm

00:32:30.399 --> 00:32:32.240
that's why i said that sad i was

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.159
imagining you out like a

00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:35.760
nature preserve like leaning against

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.760
binoculars yeah like up against like a

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.600
water refinement place just like leaning

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.120
against a chain-link fence but like just

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.120
for nothing doing nothing for hours oh

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.880
my god that's terrifying that also

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.360
sounds very similar

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.519
yeah like what are you talking about

00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:50.960
that sounds like the dream what are you

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.080
what are you talking about just leaning

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.320
at some fence against the turnpike

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.559
you're

00:32:56.559 --> 00:32:58.559
nothing everybody goes by knowing that's

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:00.559
your spot yeah you're a landmark

00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:02.240
basically that was the 80s basically

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.519
that's what people were doing back then

00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:05.200
yeah everyone was in the constant search

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.200
for a place to post up yeah you'd have

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.480
to like you'd be

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.000
totally unentertained you have to like

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.600
that you'd see someone else i'm like oh

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.440
hell yeah what's up dude yeah what are

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.720
you doing

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.159
in potsdam he would hang out by the

00:33:16.159 --> 00:33:17.840
trains every day that the train went by

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.760
that took off his leg

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.760
what yeah so he had like two crutches

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.039
and one leg

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:25.039
and you're like saluting the train that

00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:26.799
just look just looking at it just

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:29.039
watching it just watching it go by and

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:31.919
my dad loved

00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:33.519
it in the first place

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:35.600
probably

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.039
aimlessly yeah

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:38.399
and he wasn't doing it i thought he was

00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:39.519
doing that it's like a little like yo

00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:41.279
i'm the guy like a tourist attraction

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:42.799
like hey i'm the guy

00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:44.240
this train got me like give me you know

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.519
give me a buck come check me out tell

00:33:45.519 --> 00:33:47.200
you the tale dude

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.240
i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure he

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.039
accepted donations

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:53.679
how did he did he ever tell you how his

00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:55.840
only one leg got cut off on the train no

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.480
i mean the the thing was that it got

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.840
i mean i don't know my dad said he

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.679
wasn't he said he was drunk

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:03.600
and that makes sense yeah lost his life

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.320
like you know back then

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.639
hanging out on train tracks doing [ __ ]

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.000
yeah that was the [ __ ] throwing rocks

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.280
like no one doesn't knock out a train

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.560
that rolls yeah yeah

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.159
he probably lost in like the 70s too

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.440
back when it was even

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.119
at its peak i mean i wish i was born in

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:20.480
a different time you know i mean that's

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.320
how i feel about looking at train tracks

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.000
in the 70s yeah yeah i mean you just

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.960
like lay something on the track

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.079
something like if it flips the whole

00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:27.599
train whatever dude i got to find out

00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:29.919
what's up

00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:31.119
do you think this coin will flip it off

00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:32.960
the tracks but maybe i don't [ __ ]

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.800
know let's throw a rock at it too just

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.720
to be sure someone rocks the train

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.079
[ __ ] rule dude who come by and he's

00:34:38.079 --> 00:34:38.800
like

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.200
dude he was also like in the winter time

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.679
when you went to go when you rode by him

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.839
it was like dusky so it was like a

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:47.280
really cool

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.720
scene if you came at it from the right

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.599
angle

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:51.599
that's pretty chill yeah that's uh it's

00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:53.200
also really sad because that's probably

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.879
a guy who got really drunk and was like

00:34:54.879 --> 00:34:56.399
i'm gonna [ __ ] kill myself and then

00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:57.920
chickened out at the last minute got his

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.000
leg cut off

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.160
that's i could i could see that i'm

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.680
getting one leg caught off on the train

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.119
drunk you're standing there like you're

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:06.480
standing on the tracks like trying not

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.920
to look so you're like opening one eye

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.359

00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:11.440

way up his body

yeah this is like it's a military grade

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.520
psyop it's like uh okay do you ever do

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.359

when like maxim first came out

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.200
yeah he might have just been like

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.440
demolished by maxim as a teenager and

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.520
now like the ultimate is she's the

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.040
ultimate like if you're into maximum

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.960
[ __ ] it's her true

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.480
yeah she's a goddess she's the modern

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.000
day goddess she's the goat of like

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.760
maximum [ __ ]

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.040
yeah you're absolutely right pete

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.160

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.920
has like mommy issues all of his

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.000
girlfriends are like way older than me

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.040
well yeah true

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.319
is that true

00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:45.920
yeah yeah they're always like yeah he

he has [ __ ] mods shoes

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.000
yeah it's probably just to get to her

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.680
mom

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.720
that's why she broke up with her

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.760
anyway her mom's probably a perfect age

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.599
yeah isn't it isn't it uh on the record

00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:06.480
that kim kardashian's vagina stank

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.599
who said that

00:41:07.599 --> 00:41:10.480
uh reggie bush and ray j

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.359
ray j said it was well she is a minority

00:41:13.359 --> 00:41:14.880
yeah ray j was on the record saying it

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.640
was so bad

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.319
he was saying he said it was so bad that

00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:20.640
he went to his doctor about it

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.280
what he talked to his doctor

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.839
about why kim k's

00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:28.000
vag stanks so bad

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.560
wow did he describe the smell

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.520
uh

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.880
i think it was i think it was something

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.839
on the order of fishy oh that's no good

00:41:35.839 --> 00:41:37.359
yeah that could have just been a simple

00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:42.319
case of bv bacterial vaginosis

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.480
which also apparently girls can get that

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.319
if too many dudes are skeeting inside

00:41:48.319 --> 00:41:50.000
too many dudes are skeet davidson inside

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.440
of them dude what if it's just one guy

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.520
skeeting in a lot it doesn't need to be

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.359
dude is there probably probably for that

00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:57.680
mix what if pete davidson's dick was so

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.560
big

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.000
that it was skeeting in her from the

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.040
past

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.640
he was like he was back to the future

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.400
that's how big his day that's kanye's

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.319
wife you're talking about i mean let's

00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:11.200
be respectful here i can't help that

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.200
no i i support anyone who wants to kill

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.800
the guy that's spending time with his

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.720
kids

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.640
since dick is so big it broke time in

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.920
space

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.560
i don't like to spread rumors like that

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.000
he might have a micro bird let's give

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.400
him he might be no i heard it's very big

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.319
yeah i heard kanye doesn't kanye have a

00:42:28.319 --> 00:42:29.680
hog though

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.680
yeah i mean but a bigger like if when

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.280
you when somebody has like that much of

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.119
a bigger hog and they leave you for that

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:37.040
person it's like well you can never

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.359
close that gap right so he can never

00:42:39.359 --> 00:42:41.599
have her back

00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:43.359
i feel like he can nah he'll be

00:42:43.359 --> 00:42:44.880
constantly wondering about all the [ __ ]

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.760
that pete davidson was reaching

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.359
yeah but like what do you have to cut

00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:51.040
her head off at that point though

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.000
something

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.240
cut her leg off with a train

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.560
he's got a hit with a train

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.839
kanye he could but he could you're

00:42:57.839 --> 00:42:59.599
talking about a dude who could literally

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:01.839
go outside and be like

00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:03.760
i need a [ __ ] on my hand and if he

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.160
waited for i would take maybe an hour

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.079
someone would put his people yeah true

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:09.119
he's out

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:10.319
it's going to be 10 minutes it's hard to

00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:12.560
believe he can even tell two women apart

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.400
yes that's what i'm saying

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.319
just from having encountered so many of

00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:18.480
them why is there no [ __ ] on my hand

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.079
every woman he [ __ ] from now on he's

00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:21.440
just gonna be wondering how much they

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.720
actually want to be [ __ ] skeet

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.920
davidson

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.800
uh perhaps i mean yeah i guess there are

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.400
i guess there's dudes who couldn't shake

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.760
that i guess i feel like you would shake

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.119
that after that you'd get into one of

00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:32.720
those dudes you could be like okay yeah

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.160
guys have bigger dicks than me i have a

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.920
billion dollars and i can have you know

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.280
yeah i mean i would but i'm not a

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.440
[ __ ] artistic weirdo it's true that's

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.119
true that's just that's [ __ ] he's

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:42.880
scared he's a fixator

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.200
true he is a fixator

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.599
but it's also like

00:43:47.599 --> 00:43:48.720
yeah dude

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.920
he got it

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.920
also he could talk to arya that's the

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.079
alliance he needs to strike talk to

00:43:54.079 --> 00:43:57.200

court victory

00:45:33.359 --> 00:45:35.119
i don't i think honestly i think i feel

00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:36.800
like it's just there's a status battle

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.480
going on at the same time as like the

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.400
custody battle skeet davidson would have

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.240
to get his dick reduced to just under

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.839
kanye's

00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:47.440
for him to win yeah like now if kim k if

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.040
i mean at this point his life is like an

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.720
episode of kenny powers dude if he gets

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.400
kim k back from this it would be so

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.440
funny

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.800

there's like a whole

00:46:03.119 --> 00:46:04.800
business political side of these

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.319

00:46:06.319 --> 00:46:08.319
dynamic oh it's like royalty yeah

what what would the bobo version

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.640
is it is a stereotype dude obscene this

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.400
is a disgusting stereotype this is the

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.720
black future it's like harlem nights but

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.960
you know it's like it's like you ever

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.800
see like retro future dick tracy or

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.400
something

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.319
no no it's like when they do those

00:49:38.319 --> 00:49:41.359
investigative futures yeah

00:49:41.359 --> 00:49:42.880
they're talking about white you know

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.040
they do like a new art but it's like a

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.040
new art but they have like flying cars

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.800
it's like that but black i think that's

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.000
is that where you feel like black

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.720
coolness peaked in the 70s yeah like so

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.000
black people getting power they're gonna

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.400
like let's start there and work our way

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.160
up i'm thinking you gotta go there's

00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.760
gotta be like black dudes and

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.119
turtlenecks at all times you gotta like

00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:02.800
all the time yeah yeah it's like you're

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.640
talking old heads they were made when

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.880
old head culture fossilized we talked

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.920
black dudes and turtlenecks but it'd

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.400
have to be some sort of like

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.760
you know you're let me you're jumping in

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.359

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.760
deeper into black future than you i

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.680
think that's my problem yes

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.880
that's my problem

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.480
dude you have more invested in black

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.400
future than me

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.240

we're cruising we are cruising so we

00:50:43.119 --> 00:50:45.920
covered two very hot topics yeah super

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.599
important front to back delved into the

00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:49.280
subconscious too

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.520
yeah so i've been uh i've been taking in

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.440
uh some conspiracy theory [ __ ] but my

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.599
new favorite thing is uh so apparently

00:50:55.599 --> 00:50:57.200
there's a triangle

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.960
in alaska there's like a region of

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.119
alaska shaped like a triangle where

00:51:01.119 --> 00:51:03.599
every five out of one thousand people go

00:51:03.599 --> 00:51:05.359
missing

00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:07.119
and it's one of these history channel

00:51:07.119 --> 00:51:08.960
shows where it's like uh it's like the

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.720
old ufo shows but now they're like for

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.280
like local lore and stuff so apparently

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.440
