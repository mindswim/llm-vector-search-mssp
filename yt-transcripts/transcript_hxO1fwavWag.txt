and it's like this week even people that

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.549
would be susceptible to that message

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.649

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.750
studio full of people and they're like I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.820

from it might be peloton yeah what's

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.080

yeah that was gonna be November I doubt

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.459
the cure is now just total civil unrest

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.680
Golf speaking of Civil War I just my mom

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.060
literally just handed me a very

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.950
problematic drawing I drew when I was a

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.489
boy

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.090

Stars and Bars breath true the lugging

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:21.690

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.370
confederate flag they they just killed

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.410

yeah is that Abe uh what he's got is oh

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.290
that's definitely a rifle in his head he

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.459
might have been a sharpshooter to be

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.079
honest I was a big fan of sharpshooters

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.970
it was the most important war in America

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.380
and the only one we lost oh man so

and there's gonna be no like you know

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.200
the means justify the ends when it comes

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.930
to executing uh you know hundreds of

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.480
thousands of people it'd be good after

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.540
you but you you have a higher profile so

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.190
they're gonna find you easier but then

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.370

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.620
my retweets if my timelines just you

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.810
bunch of like creative writing majors

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.520

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:58.020
the window of baskin-robbins somehow

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.210
with the basket so not baskin-robbins

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.280
bent like my favorite that protest

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.020
picture that lady that was like open the

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.060
[ __ ] economy they're just holding

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.130
first off the Baskin Robbins was open

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:17.169
she had ice cream in her hand you see

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:20.949
white kids looting minority businesses

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:22.539
or you see them like giving the finger

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:26.590
to black hot just a weird look yeah yeah

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.620
of course yeah I don't really blame the

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.780
15 16 year old black kids for grabbing

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.900
sneakers because it's even I blame that

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.300
the black de Blasio for not figuring out

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.639
a way to stop it for life I kind of get

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:42.250
out a little bit more so than like a

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.810
rich white person or a middle-class

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.419
white person pretending to be like a

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:51.460
black person yeah yeah but yeah I mean

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.840
it's tough though to boy like how did

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.060
they what kind of pre-emptive measures

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.259
could they have taken for like which

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:59.650
stores the board up and all that they

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.599
like they barricaded the footlocker

00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:03.820
prematurely if you like with yes oh you

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.409
got oh that's what you think okay I see

00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:07.120
how you're doing it poor Locker was a

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:15.780
that was number one on the hit or not

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:24.789
you know the grocery stores fashion bug

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:29.259
oh yeah it's like there's no impress

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:32.620
like white white kids from for mine are

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.659
not oppressed in this country like at

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.729
all there's no argument for that so to

00:08:36.729 --> 00:08:39.789
run around dressed in all black throwing

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.190
[ __ ] it's like alright man

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.640
but come on like what are you doing you

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.400
know well then they're [ __ ] like look

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.199

weigh in on ship a dead

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.610

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.830
black lives matter and being like no you

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.320

here's communism and anarchy right

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.260
they're just using they're literally

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.779
piggybacking off of black struggle to

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:09.580
put out their political ideology they

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.089
learned at college it's [ __ ] weird

00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:17.130
their degree that's pretty cool they are

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:22.900
perfect I need them I see Anti Fog do

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.520
then it's a front date so right now if

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.810
you drive around Philly you'll just see

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.810
many people that got up there like it's

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.360
finally here like they were preparing on

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.750

all these people who have been on

00:11:38.529 --> 00:11:40.210
reading before chance the last four

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.490
years are like this is it and they just

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:48.430
go and grab a bat although 10,000 hours

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:52.120
of frog memes it's all paid off we did

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.510
it

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.839
we triggered them enough yeah what do

00:11:55.839 --> 00:12:03.310
you think more relaxed now people like

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.850
we've looted enough yeah I think so I

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:07.839
think they've had their fill

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:11.740
yeah lockers are empty

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.209
they've rode up they've wrote in the

00:12:13.209 --> 00:12:14.470
articles I guess specifically what

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.750
stores got hit now I was like that

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.160
reporter that got hit with a bottle and

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:26.680
then the camera zooms is what if the

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.930
government gives reparations but takes

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.570
like takes off the cost of all the

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.650
looted sneakers and some dude was like

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.900
we want 14 trillion dollars ahead of I

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.029
forget was like what 14 trillion in

00:12:40.029 --> 00:12:41.350
reparations I think the government's be

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.779
like all right you know minus the cost

00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:45.640
of all the sneakers of property damage

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.209
yeah you get enough $1500 it's like when

00:12:49.209 --> 00:12:50.620
you get off of a cruise and you see your

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.060
real bill and you're like what the fly

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.130
[Laughter]

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.830
yes it's all gay what do you think about

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.660
the AutoZone cop who was like they well

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.130
they say he was a cop the guy he was

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.779
smashing glass and it's just a dude in

00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:09.100
full you can't see him at all he's

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.510
wearing a full motorcycle helmet they're

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.910
like spread the word this is a cop we

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.920
know it for sure it's just a dude and

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.360
smashed but he don't smash the AutoZone

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:16.780
glass

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.060
like hey man your copy does do copies

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.560
like get the [ __ ] out here he turns like

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.910
his whole body's in one direction you

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.990
look like cops yeah I don't I don't I

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.180
would be truly surprised if the cops

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.030
were inciting the road.the like I was I

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.380
was a little confused when I saw those

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.600
like brick videos you know I like just

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.640
pallets of bricks and then somebody I do

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.680
you know hate to give BuzzFeed credit

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.180
but a guy from BuzzFeed wrote an article

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.070
that debunked every single one of those

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.680
brick videos and it was like alright

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.050
maybe maybe they're not maybe the cops

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.670
aren't in on it I don't know

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.810
they can't loose black dudes the

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.130
conspiracy theories is that's that's

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.630
like that's propping up the Trump

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.070
campaign so it's like they invite people

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.690
of conspiracy theory so they're probably

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:05.410
trying to like no no movements like the

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.300
FBI does get involved right but did you

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.790
infiltrate those black yeste like so I

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.770
guess I guess I get the instinct of

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.260
being like hey this could be [ __ ]

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.120
something where they're like you know if

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.620
you have a peaceful protest a great way

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.050
to get people to not give a [ __ ] about

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.510
it or to turn on it is you just send a

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.610
few people in there to [ __ ] catch the

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.180
pop you know yeah I agreed I mean

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.740
obviously that's true like yeah the FBI

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.300
and definitely all that is definitely

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.440
true but I don't think they're sending

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:37.570
down like one local PD guide sending

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:39.790
this they that's because even the cops

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.410
know that those guys are absolutely

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:52.720
inadequate you know see much like square

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.460
bodied men rushing the Home Depot and

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.750
you're like hold on a second here this

00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:12.460
is a [ __ ] this is the PD yeah you see

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.720
some cell phone clips that's what they

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.400
need to be looking for like analytic

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:22.900
OtterBox they see OtterBox they should

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.850
do the analytics between dudes who have

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.820
OtterBox holsters and Trump votes that's

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.430
gotta be his damn it like 1%

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.320
under percent because they're afraid

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.029
they're like I'm gonna protect my phone

00:15:34.029 --> 00:15:40.420
my family maybe OtterBox should start

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.830
like putting out ads to protect the

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:46.830
white race protected your cellphone yeah

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.620
yeah yeah man I think we're like I I

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.050
think it's possible we've just become so

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.029
propagandize from multiple sources if I

00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:56.709
mean it's very possible you would have

00:15:56.709 --> 00:15:58.420
Russian Chinese agents who are

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.190
operatives in America who are like oh

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.140
you're there right now go Stoke that up

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.640
so we could have piec we could have like

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.930
it'd be funny if this is all this like a

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.029
dude from Guam like Guam was like yeah

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:09.310
let's go [ __ ] up America or like I don't

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.899
think anyone knows at all what's going

00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:12.310
on I think they just the media sees it

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.320
what are we gonna spend perfect boom in

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.149
it you know yeah that's Twitter it's all

00:16:19.149 --> 00:16:20.980
it's all like you were like Matt like

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.779
you said less you know last episode we

00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:24.550
did it's like these are Twitter videos

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.339
that they're also allegedly first-hand

00:16:27.339 --> 00:16:29.770
accounts and they're all like almost all

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.120
of them were at both sides of doing it

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.040
almost always debunk like I watched one

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.839
earlier that was like this black dude

00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:37.060
holding up a dog like a puppy and he was

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.800
holding it up by like its back it's like

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.650
skin behind the lady that was a live

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.240
interview she was just a reporter he was

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.589
like holding it up and then they're like

00:16:44.589 --> 00:16:46.000
we need to find this piece of [ __ ] that

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.640
dog was found murdered so like they and

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.470

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.000
he's hetero and then he just gets real

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.280
hammered at the end of the night you

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.780
know he just fits here and he stares in

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.070
his drink and then like every now and

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.570
then they like come awake and I'll be

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:33.220
like he'll be like it's not right that's

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.039
the stage we're at and I'm an expert in

00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:38.860
Irish drunken tragedy that's the stage

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.780
of the country we're at we're like it's

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.960
it ain't gonna get much better you know

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.559
yeah I don't see how ya know it's like

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:49.390
I'm usually pretty optimistic but I'm

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.710
like looking at it in the state of

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.539
things in terms of like again people

00:18:52.539 --> 00:18:54.100
have in their own little little media

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.080
diet that's like me am right tell me I'm

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.610
it's a go hamster dot you're like

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.080
hitting the little panic I'm right I'm

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.700
right and they're all doing it yeah I

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.260
really don't think it is until people

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.080
just completely can be like yeah I'm not

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.700
watching the news I'm just you know it's

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.080
gonna do my thing watch firsthand

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.179
footage dude Sydney was talking about he

00:19:10.179 --> 00:19:11.559
would sit there and watch the news and

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:12.909
then watch the periscope footage of

00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:14.740
where the news was yeah I got all those

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.720
people mostly mostly peaceful protests

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.820
and he'd be watching on periscope people

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.110
beating the [ __ ] out of people and all

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.610
kinds of crazy [ __ ] it's just kind of

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.260
like yeah it's like what they do it's

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.909
like what they do during like a flood

00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:27.640
with the news newscasters in a boat and

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.289
then a guy just walks by and ankle-deep

00:19:29.289 --> 00:19:39.789
water there is clearly the objective

00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:41.500
reality but no one has any interest in

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.530
it and if you bring it up you're like if

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.470
you bring out any fact or reason people

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.860
like y'all the [ __ ] is wrong so

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.090
everybody I think it's this weird period

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.970
like between like technology totally

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.580
taking over and like it's partially

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.290
because right now this is all being

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.840
driven by Twitter you know and all these

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.400
things he said flaming us making us

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.040
crazy but I think it may be 20 years or

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.560
whatever we are found and then we're

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.330
just able to regulate ourselves much

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.580
easier but like this weird in-between

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.260
where and now is kind of like [ __ ] us

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.080
up yeah because we start blocking people

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.250
in real life is like okay two weeks ago

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:25.950
I am now asking him to put a chip in us

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.810
yeah this right dude yeah yeah seriously

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.530
yeah I mean that's the other thing too

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.120
you don't hear about Cove it at all it's

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.510
done it's over well yeah cause if if you

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.340
bring up if if the new the news is

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.320
afraid if they bring up covin they're

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.300
gonna get called racist that's right

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.180
that's you know that's worth more to

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.300
them than the lives that they kept

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.370
claiming we're about to be lost I'm

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.170
willing to risk not being called racists

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.790
for a hundred thousand Nansen paps

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.520
that's what I don't quote I just finally

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.980
if Cuomo came out was like he said

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.600
something about it I just told the

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.560
headline didn't read it but apparently

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.950
he addressed the link between protesters

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.370
and kovat music Cuomo spending in the

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.610
Mafia to deal with the protesters he's

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.410
sending in the mob good for social

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.790
distancing yeah man all we can do is

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.560
just get in shape and get hot dude oh

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.630

yourself at worse and worse versions and

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.530

home Phil Phil's got a very toxic

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:49.250
regimen right now my dad of getting

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:51.380
hammered and watching Fox watching riots

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.080
before bed well yeah I mean just

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.940
drinking and watching riots and then

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.940
trying to sleep his dreams I've never I

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.100
also never thought about Phil's my dad's

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.340
dreams

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.720
he's probably dreams like a dog or he's

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.980
just in bed like put his feet he just

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.360
sees like some teenager pulling off his

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:17.660
white New Balances pulled down his long

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.730
tube socks like leave me alone

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.470
I wonder if cops have that dream way

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.090
like you can't but like they can't choke

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.300
a black dude they just can't strangle

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.460
[Laughter]

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.250
yeah so I've been arguing with him and

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.190
uh yeah last night I get out on Twitter

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:46.429
a little which China I got it's an issue

00:28:46.429 --> 00:28:49.670
right now I can't well it wasn't the

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.600
worst thing in the world

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.760
it's felt it felt coin anytime I post

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.289
something you know I get crushed by the

00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:57.200
left whichever way the tweet leans I get

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.350
my hearted so this one was I I don't

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.669
want to throw Phil under the bus but it

00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:03.110
was on Fox News and they were talking

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.809
about how I think the stat was like 9 on

00:29:05.809 --> 00:29:08.299
a non 9 unarmed black people had been

00:29:08.299 --> 00:29:10.010
killed or something like that and 19

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.929
unarmed white people had been killed as

00:29:11.929 --> 00:29:14.210
if that was gonna if that was like an

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.250
argument to be like you don't hear us

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:21.020
bitching it's like well that doesn't

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.990
undermine the protest it's like dark

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.370
meat campy hey we're [ __ ] killing

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:35.270
everybody it's not about rest we did it

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.950
got called gay by a bunch of dudes and I

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.890
was like [ __ ] the people that were

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:54.500
liking it and retweeting it I see my

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.809
retweets it's like Candice Owens retweet

00:29:56.809 --> 00:29:58.940
something and then the next person who

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.830
retweet something is a violet communist

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:04.460
and then the next time you know we're

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.710
all over the map so that's what we

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.169
should do we should be doing that cuz

00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:13.100

good at [ __ ] Twitter and all the

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:20.330
sudden I think I was trying to be it

just came off shitty shitty it's a valid

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.809
point it's just it's going into a vortex

00:30:26.809 --> 00:30:29.240
of like political spazzing where people

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:34.309

yeah yeah I'm exactly the way to do it

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.429
this is all happening the way it should

00:31:22.429 --> 00:31:24.409
happen gotta remember that

00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:26.990
Trump's the president like people are

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.900
you know celebrities behind the gates

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.370

down I mean this is exactly what it's

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.500
what everyone thought would have

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.600
happened is now it's the most

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.520
predictable thing you know it's like

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.000
three months of no work we give everyone

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.980
$1,200 we shoot a couple you know step

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.149
on a couple of black guys hags

00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:55.549

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.270
out there and I just himself where you

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.710
guys were that thing you sent me on

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.110
Instagram is so [ __ ] funny yeah he's

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:05.270
pulled up I was like yeah we're the the

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:09.890
Takashi six nine video yeah there's a

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:11.690
meme of like Trump walking out at night

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:14.059
and it's just a video of Takashi six

00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:15.710

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:17.330
like talking [ __ ] in the streets okay

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.760
this is my block [ __ ] it was

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.380
funny to imagine Trump walking out just

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.820
like yeah it's what the [ __ ] I thought

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.350
he just tear-gassed everyone out of the

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:32.690
way so we could hold I mean you just go

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.460
you like who are these people with any

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.360
hope let me let me let me meet them you

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.760
know like it's like two weeks ago plus

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.820
he was like you're fat she's an old bird

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.450
I'm like man this is just I will mess

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:49.610
what the [ __ ] was she going forward with

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.230
the Bible like I normally I can

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.090
understand their tactics and like how

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.340
corny it is but I was she trying to be

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.140
like I'm a Christian too is that what

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.570
that was yeah this is a woman who the

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.580
second night of lockdown during the

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.240
pandemic

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.429
she gave people a tour of her freezer

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.510
gelato before but I was like this is

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:15.340
really in bad taste right now

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.940
[ __ ] sing but you know what now

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:29.010
that's kind of [ __ ] up tonight yeah

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:47.440
[ __ ] stupid there oh yeah man I don't

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.350
again I think I'm optimistic and I think

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:52.270
it'll be eventually will mean it gets

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.460
harder and harder but I think it's

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.260
getting so ridiculous that people are

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.420
gonna just like it with the current

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.770
presidential race it's like you know

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.540
we're under an existential threat with

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.190
Trump that's that's the narrative like

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.780
Trump is like bringing us to the brink

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.660
of destruction and the DNC is like you

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.160
know the think tank that it was behind

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.980
the DNC a move is like go Joe Biden it's

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.380
like what the [ __ ] that's that's our

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.300
response if this job is so important

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.590
that it could lead us to the brink of

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.620
like destruction where does this guy fit

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.360
in who has like multiple weird sex

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.030
charges things stuttering can't go on

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.290
Charlamagne without saying something

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:27.580
read it without putting his foot on it

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.710
yeah his mouth it's like how is that a

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:31.390
real job if that's the guy who are like

00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:33.550
we got them it's like I just think more

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.470
people gonna be I gotta stop stupid well

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:36.790
the Democrats I don't know how to win

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:38.290
like log and Paul said something very

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:40.090
like you know whatever progressive the

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.040
other day right he's like hey black

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.440
lives matter you gotta be like you know

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.510
anti-racist it's not enough to just be

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.400
not raised or whatever sending me like a

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.070
nice thing and now like it was everyone

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.980
like this like right and now today

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.290
they're like hey [ __ ] you what have you

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.860
got and it's like it's never enough like

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.740
it'll never be enough it's a religion

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.690
and it'll net you'll never be able to be

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:07.360
pure enough to [ __ ] be an ally so

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.420
it's like I think they want to lose like

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.600
like subconsciously they don't want to

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.880
win they like you think they like being

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.170
subs yeah they like it stops they like

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:22.090
they love it what it's like to just get

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:23.530
smacked around a little bit maybe a

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:27.070
little belt around the neck yeah I mean

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.910
very uh

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.560
yeah actually makes a lot of sense it

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.640
kind of [ __ ] up if your whole identity

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.320
is built around being a victim then like

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.960
once you win the White House it's like

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:41.360
what are you gonna do yeah it's kind of

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.220
sucks Peter Bauer what do you think just

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:56.750
gonna do once he's done rallies are

00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:01.220
keeping him alive oh they have a trump

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.190
rally uh right by my house June or July

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:07.910
11th pretty sick yes so whatever he does

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:09.830
he needs to have rallies it needs to be

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:12.020
involved what if they could once you die

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.580
we won't make it to the point where once

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.440
you die the AI gets good enough where

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.990
they can just have like a you body can

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:19.490
exist just somehow artificially

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:20.450
maintained where you're just like a

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.070
walking West world but you just continue

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.260
about whatever your agenda was because I

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.830
think that's a Magister I insist you

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.650
that too like we want to pioneer a new

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.540
technology that allows Trump to be the

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:37.460
president for the end of all time like

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.650
Elon Musk is like if you thought this

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:41.300
space launch is impressive

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.280
you gotta get a load of the new body

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:50.600
suit just like he's talking to wrong and

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.520
he's like was just gonna upload Trump's

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.530
consciousness to a mainframe and give

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.390
him a body and he's going to be our

00:36:56.390 --> 00:37:04.910
leader so far yeah I think he's I don't

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:06.230
know do some people are thinking this is

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:10.610
gonna help Trump get reelected I don't

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:17.390
know dude it depends like you just

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:19.460
create a binary between like law and

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.790
order and chaos right and that's what

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.290
you don't want to do because if you do

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.870
that the people that say hey I own a car

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:31.190
I rent an apartment or own a house work

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.230
at a business and I have kids and I like

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:36.770
I want cops to be you know held

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.170
accountable but I also just don't want

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:40.970
other casts because this is a protest

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:43.220
without any objective

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.119
without any specific demands that's

00:37:46.119 --> 00:37:48.680
descending into chaos looting and

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.990
criminality and then the media's going

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.630
out and telling you it's not happening

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:55.250
they're the ones they're going out there

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.830
going yeah this is our peaceful protest

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:01.400
and we see with our eyes so again it

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.920
pits Trump against media Trump women's

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.490
and it pitch chaos against order orders

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.560
gonna win it just always does

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.770
yeah yeah I agree I think I think with

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.060
the way they're gonna have to try to

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.520
spin it is to be like the chaos is here

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.150
because of Trump the only that's they're

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.670
gonna be it is it is that the Democrats

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:25.640
could that might be the only demand it's

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.340
like well the demand is we need to vote

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.560
more Democrats into office which seems

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.670
to be what they're doing

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.970
yeah I think this is this was funny I

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.950
didn't see what happened I know AOC said

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:39.230
she was gonna go down to save the people

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.420
on the bridge last night did a OCA did

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:46.099
anybody know if she listen you want to

00:38:46.099 --> 00:38:47.720
go fight the cops you fight the cops be

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:55.609
on the bridge it's like pick a lane you

00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:58.820
know I'm fighting are you [ __ ] like

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.460
are you [ __ ] kind of overthrow the

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.310
government are you not yeah you can't

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:24.440
call timeout timeout I genuinely have

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.940
been laughing thinking about every

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.980
communist revolution being that just

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.660
Lenin on a bridge like surrounded by

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:40.010
cops be like stop hitting us or just

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:44.030
push me yeah this movement needs a like

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:45.500
you don't have a Stalin you need a

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:51.380
flying true it's like you need a [ __ ]

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.740
boss yeah no that's true what's also the

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.390
Trump I think is gonna win again to you

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:57.270
because

00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:58.799
the thing that I've been I don't I

00:39:58.799 --> 00:40:00.180
haven't seen a lot of stuff on social

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.559
media but the message I've been getting

00:40:01.559 --> 00:40:03.390
is that like black people hate antiphon

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.250
now and antifouling I was linked to the

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.440
left so it's like I don't think they're

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.579
gonna go vote for Trump but they're just

00:40:08.579 --> 00:40:10.140
when they man [ __ ] it up [ __ ] Biden in

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.390
my boobs that [ __ ] they're like man I

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:13.920
think black people right here are

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.740
skeptical of the idea that voting like

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.109
like either one of these parties or

00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:21.119
either one of these candidates is truly

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:23.970
gonna make a big difference I think if

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:25.529
you lose a killer Mike he's really

00:40:25.529 --> 00:40:27.480
smaller things he talks he's very smart

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.849
and he talking about local [ __ ]

00:40:29.849 --> 00:40:32.069
it's got to be local you got a vote out

00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:35.940
like corrupt prosecutors DA's all that

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.029
[ __ ] the president it's like you know

00:40:39.029 --> 00:40:41.369
what are we doing like it's really not

00:40:41.369 --> 00:40:43.920
affecting you as much as like a governor

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.069
a congressman or even like at the very

00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:48.599
local level a judge

00:40:48.599 --> 00:40:50.640
yeah judge it's just throwing people in

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.369
jail get rid of the [ __ ] judge yeah I

00:40:53.369 --> 00:40:54.690
was reading about with the DA's last

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:56.250
night how that was a I mean it was a

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:58.049
George Soros article I'm not gonna lie

00:40:58.049 --> 00:41:00.089
but they're talking about how they were

00:41:00.089 --> 00:41:01.410
saying he's going in and like while

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:02.520
everyone's worried about the president

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.599
like you're saying you just go and just

00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:05.279
get a bunch of DA's elected it's cheaper

00:41:05.279 --> 00:41:07.109
to do it's easy to do and that has more

00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:09.599
of a direct impact on everybody so

00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:11.039
that's pretty naive a thought about that

00:41:11.039 --> 00:41:13.400
yeah I think that's probably better

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.260
I think Instagram is the best in terms

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.150
of what you can do like Instagram yeah

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.859
but then second would be to vote out to

00:41:19.859 --> 00:41:24.930
DA's yeah for sure yeah I love all

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:26.579
comedians we've all carpet bagged our

00:41:26.579 --> 00:41:27.900
way into politics or political

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:34.230
commentators now honestly we have

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:38.039
literally no choice mmm sure I'd love to

00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:41.460
be talking about come and you know farts

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:45.049
right now I know but [ __ ] this is

00:41:45.049 --> 00:41:47.339
get back there did you see the guy in

00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:49.349
the process that started screaming like

00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:52.079
he's he's speaking and then everyone's

00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:53.490
cloudy and then he starts saying the

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:55.670
n-word yes really

00:41:55.670 --> 00:42:02.549
what a [ __ ] wild literally he's

00:42:02.549 --> 00:42:04.230
giving a speech and people like oh hell

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.549
yeah cuz it's like you know you looking

00:42:05.549 --> 00:42:07.619
at just an old old Philly guy and he

00:42:07.619 --> 00:42:09.029
stays screaming and then finally he's

00:42:09.029 --> 00:42:10.860
like we are all n-word

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:19.440
it was like I got I get where you going

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.240
for bud but yeah I guess we read the

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:29.940
room that was his moment he was like

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.060
finally I can say I thought he must

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.590
adrenaline just a hundred percent and

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:36.030
then he was just like it's I'm throwing

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.430
it out dude here it is I've been waiting

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.080
to use it everyone smiling at me and

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:46.520
clapping yeah n-word before his time

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.290
yes that was a solution he's like if I

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:50.550
just say the n-word it'll bring us all

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.700
together

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:59.880
civilizations coming on done yeah yeah

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.800
man it just sucks - the reason for it is

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.570
it's not like if we were like getting

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:05.370
like directly like you know yanked out

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:06.630
of our houses and all this [ __ ] it's

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.940
just people are watching the news and

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.460
being like and then they go out yeah

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.590
let's go it's not like really again if

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.540
you go like statistic people who are

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.130
like I watch the news to stay informed

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:19.770
it's like there's none of it's based on

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:22.290
like it's amazing cause it's almost

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.060
always contradicting like statistical

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.400
information like the actual data it's

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.930
just fun and thrown out people I'm

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:29.040
trying to stay informed it's like no

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.080
you're actually misleading yourself by

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.700
watching that yeah and you're trying to

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.290
stay informed him by staying forum do

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.000
you mean win a Facebook argument yeah

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.890
right right that's what everyone's doing

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:39.480
they're trying to be the one who wins

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.280
the Facebook argument yep it's my shout

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.390
out to my aunt Kathleen who literally

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:50.910
posted a recipe and then four days later

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:53.400
just to quote put these animals down on

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:59.580
the old face just a recipe and then put

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:09.090
the animals a pineapple summer upside

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:12.810
down and she's like the next coaches

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:15.410
like put these goddamn animals down

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:21.140
DeBlasio reside it's it's funny

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.589
it's it's great to see like how like

00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:30.030
people sit around today and they're like

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.220
how could the Nazis do that how can the

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.349
German people do this it's like that's

00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:35.940
what it is the same people that are

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.849
posting like oh here's a nice cake and

00:44:38.849 --> 00:44:44.000
they would ship hops off Oh kill them

00:44:45.020 --> 00:45:01.460
that's in almost every person all day

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:03.920
they're like dogs the dogs in the house

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.359
ya hear noise outside that kill it

00:45:06.359 --> 00:45:12.089
killed it I was laying I was laying

00:45:12.089 --> 00:45:13.470
everything was fine I had a pineapple

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.460
recipe going and these goddamn animals

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.650
that's so [ __ ] for me yeah well

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.690
Facebook arguments are just that's what

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:23.550
it's for as well as for Phil held last

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.619
night got the 19 unarmed white people

00:45:25.619 --> 00:45:28.530
executed that is it is that's in his

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:31.309
back pocket all day

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:35.069
that's all the cops the cops are killed

00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:36.900
more you know they've killed on more

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.650
unarmed white people yeah well so that's

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:42.329
that that's a statistical thing because

00:45:42.329 --> 00:45:43.770
it's like if you look at the thing from

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:44.910
the left they'll be like between the

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:49.650
years 2003 and 2020 or 2022 no like so

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:51.180
I'll do the time window Fox would be

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.040
like between these three months actually

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.390
they killed more white people trying to

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:56.010
build you a little fact and be like now

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:57.630
this is reality they can they do at

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:00.359
least Phil as a fact say Kathy will

00:46:00.359 --> 00:46:02.099
literally respond people on a honor

00:46:02.099 --> 00:46:05.160
timeline you go deep into thread a few

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.930
comments she's like how about you go ask

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:16.650
Jesus Christ why for this moment why do

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.599
you think that is she goes ask Jesus

00:46:18.599 --> 00:46:22.619
Christ Elliot I've been trying to dig up

00:46:22.619 --> 00:46:25.799
the my brother-in-law back when black

00:46:25.799 --> 00:46:28.770
lives matter just started he made a meme

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:32.640
he's an Arab Arab Christian he's from

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.020
Egypt he's like a Coptic Christian and

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.330
he loves Jesus he's got a Jesus tattoo

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:45.910
he's got a cross tattoo but he know he's

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:50.710
got black kids now but uh but he uh yeah

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:52.420
he's so he's normal he's he's totally

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.060
America but he wrote when

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.590
blacklivesmatter popped off he thought

00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:58.420
he was making like kind of a nice meme

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:01.150
and it was just like a cartoon of Jesus

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:03.070
being crucified it said all lives matter

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:07.570
it makes no sense I've been trying to

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:09.400
find it write it dig it up right now and

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:18.850
just be like yeah this you bro you know

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:34.360
you put them down okay well a lot of

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.160
Arab immigrants are from countries where

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.900
