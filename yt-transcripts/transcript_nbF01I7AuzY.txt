00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.460
thing is is like I I was all I used to

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:12.820
work with

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.169
and there was like we'd always like we

00:28:14.169 --> 00:28:16.000
always [ __ ] around and have fun there

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.399
was dudes who would like try to like

00:28:17.399 --> 00:28:20.049
[ __ ] with him yeah seriously yeah so I

00:28:20.049 --> 00:28:21.730
snapped on a floor guy once I did not

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.440
like that at all yeah it's Tom Ford I

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.059
started like getting like real mean

00:28:25.059 --> 00:28:26.440
there was just like nab bro we don't

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.820
like that we could toss him like

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.870
probably like 250 likes he'd be fired up

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:34.480
yeah it would make his day but also if

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.190
there were mean comments I don't say

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:37.750
we're gonna be mean to him cuz he's just

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.210
so [ __ ] easy like yeah I mean I think

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.380
you'll get buried yeah

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.960
so he made a video he's like guys which

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.820
Deadpool costume should I go with and

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.769
then it's as swipe right you see the

00:28:47.769 --> 00:28:49.059
different costumes - the first one is

00:28:49.059 --> 00:28:56.320
him and he packed he stuffed up front

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.990
stuff is dong I think he's being modest

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.759
dude I do too I don't think he's

00:29:00.759 --> 00:29:02.889
shielding I don't think he lives in our

00:29:02.889 --> 00:29:05.440
realm of superficial you know where it's

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.149
like oh yeah I want to act like I have a

00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:09.399
big dick I think he was like just comes

00:29:09.399 --> 00:29:10.720
with this thing don't look at my

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.029
probably envelop spades penis with his

00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:21.539
beer is that the consensus that Iceman I

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.309
can call Burton from here in the

00:29:24.309 --> 00:29:26.040

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.000
seen in my life I was tight jack was

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.129
doing a gladiator scene by himself in

sitting there up in the ceiling on a

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.679
ladder my guys hold a ladder and he

00:30:57.679 --> 00:30:59.270

movie watch a scene rewind it and like

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.320

drag [ __ ] at schools just doesn't even

00:33:46.539 --> 00:33:47.950
make sense like yeah it's it like

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.750
libraries and so yeah it's pretty weird

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:51.309
I think we've talked about it yeah where

00:33:51.309 --> 00:33:52.830
it's like they bring that all these

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.640

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.549
I don't know I don't want to have gender

00:33:57.549 --> 00:34:09.550
norms on our kid power like a power

shirt yeah that's like black power I

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.760
think it's like that BBS he was applying

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.820
to school yeah showed me the [ __ ]

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.950
applications so funny you can you

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:23.919
include your pronouns ones like Z Z Zim

00:34:23.919 --> 00:34:28.929
sir that's my and then something about

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:32.710
like your person I don't know what it

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.080
was but it was like are you a two-spirit

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.409
are you a like a Cosby yes and I was

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.480
like say that you're a Z name to spirit

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.360
like a Z a two-spirited Z

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.150
dude what is his school it's just

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.190
anymore yeah yeah they're all they're

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.380
all rocking it in there dude I was like

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.720
the two-spirited Z has to dig a trench

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.230
for the power line because it's all

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.370
studios I'm telling you this [ __ ]

00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:59.680
it makes it makes no sense because you

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.670
know I'm [ __ ] beating a dead horse

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:02.350
but the whole like genders are social

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.210
constructs so they're like there we

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:05.440
weren't we were talking about that [ __ ]

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.930
where it's like well you know like what

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.580
the [ __ ] someone said they were trashing

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.640
a boys in one of my classic little boys

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.920
always girls are so much smarter girls

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.300
are so much smarter little boys this is

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.040
a [ __ ] room for like 25 30 40

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.240
year-old something's in there like jesus

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.770
[ __ ] christ they're better at school

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.540
girls you know you remember that just

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.380
cuz we're talking I like with the

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.520
placements around you know like pretty

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.280
much loud version of boys drool girls

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.570
usual yeah that's it bro high-five

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:29.950
that's what I said they were like I

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.090
think you're basically the same they

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.010
kept trashing boy like you know as a

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.150
girl and you like oh my god that some

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.920
boys are doing so annoying like and

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.210
they're just going on and the finally

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.310
the teacher goes like alright that's it

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:40.810
I think I just pulled out my phone is

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:42.370
like whatever studies show that girls

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.610
get a Jupiter to get more stupider

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.490
[Laughter]

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.900
they're like let's try to rein it in and

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.400
I was like honestly I'm kind of over the

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.950
you know girls rule boys drool portion

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.470
of my life I remember going to st.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.330
Cornelius on the bus and someone hit me

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.310
with boys go to Jupiter to get more

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:02.170
stupider girls go to college get more

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:09.070
knowledge I [ __ ] melted so that's

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.480
where I kind of like the other there's

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.740
one more dude in there it's kind of like

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:12.970
you know how about we just kind of drop

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.410
the whole gender thing and you just like

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:17.980
just dick you're always like well for

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.810
the record I understand what I'm saying

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.640
boys do kind of things I'm saying like

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.850
it's totally a social consciousness it's

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:26.200
going to this whole thing so it's like

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.970
alright so if a boy is doing all these

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:29.170
predetermined behaviors

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.480
that's all I learned social construct

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.690
but if I someone born a female wants to

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.170
become a boy that's an innate biological

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:40.030
characteristic and not what the [ __ ] you

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.250
guys talking about I busted that out in

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:43.750
class one time dude everyone was just

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:45.430
kind of like Matt mckusker destroys

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:49.240
liberals that was under I found it I'm

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.570
sorry under gender for this college epic

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:55.750
woman man a gender gender fluid

his f scene thing cracked all this [ __ ]

01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:11.040

think that means it's probably worth six

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:04.700
I do think he's uh what he's onto is

01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:08.720
what I'm about that's pretty much Kanye

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:10.790
West he's out illogical thinking he's

01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:13.130
going full you guys did the same YouTube

01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:15.830
loop for a while did dude so it's like I

01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:16.910
get what he's trying to say it's

01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:19.010
frustrating it's hard to express but so

01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:21.770

01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:22.880
high I'm like I can't go to sleep right

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.410
now so it was I'm gonna go into a weird

01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:26.240
where I'm hole up in my bed so I lay

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.990

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:37.880
in my bed just like like all this weird

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:40.520
[ __ ] going on and then dude it's hard

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.870
again I get into Kanye mode I can't

01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:43.910
explain it but it was full dwelling on

01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:45.670
the threshold where you confront your

01:21:45.670 --> 01:21:48.290
unpretentious itself it's like I can't

01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:49.550
handle this I can't and then you just go

01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:53.920
like this

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.540
naturally maybe because you were twisted

01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:58.850
yeah I was so high but I also have again

01:21:58.850 --> 01:22:00.800
I have a thick neck so I produced the MT

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.480
that's why I follow you pretty much can

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:05.090
trip on DMT whenever you exactly yeah so

01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:06.860
I'm in this weird state and my eyes are

01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.870
closed I'm like sending the thing in my

01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:10.520
bed and then it's like you get to a

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.080
point where like I can't handle this and

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.640
you go no that version of myself can't

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.110
handle this you transcend that version

01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:18.770
you still hug that's maybe but dude s so

01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:20.180
I'm basically now I'm gonna take that

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.620
and that's when after the microdose

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:23.030

like a 40 you know 40 milligram edible

01:22:43.989 --> 01:22:45.880

scene at the end you see a very very

01:24:55.289 --> 01:24:57.510
funny sex scene and it's very

01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:58.769
uncomfortable to watch with your mom

01:24:58.769 --> 01:25:00.929
especially when Phil comes down for a

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:01.499
walk

01:25:01.499 --> 01:25:03.389
Phil comes down from watching a little

01:25:03.389 --> 01:25:04.619
Monday Night Football

01:25:04.619 --> 01:25:06.989
he's already frustrated his son he's

01:25:06.989 --> 01:25:08.340
already upset that his son's watching

01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:09.899
some fruitcake everybody instead of

01:25:09.899 --> 01:25:12.119
watching the game you see you didn't

01:25:12.119 --> 01:25:13.439
watch money and then he was relegated

01:25:13.439 --> 01:25:18.780
the different television because sister

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.969

01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:26.849
let's watch a scary movie and you're not

01:25:26.849 --> 01:25:28.110

01:25:35.639 --> 01:25:37.769
that sex scene and he was like what the

01:25:37.769 --> 01:25:39.959

high and watch that movie you're gonna

01:25:46.499 --> 01:25:51.510
[ __ ] you're gonna flip out when you

mysticism a lot of [ __ ] I mean it's

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.340
it's not like this is like what this is

01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.289
if what you should want to start happens

01:26:04.289 --> 01:26:06.149
I think a hundred years from now well

01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:08.340
it's not like it's that scary it's just

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:10.949
really it's just twisting yeah it's just

01:26:10.949 --> 01:26:12.630
off-putting it's like you ever see the

01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:15.419
witch yes yes it's like the same [ __ ]

01:26:15.419 --> 01:26:17.789
