their head when it comes to like them on

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.130

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.430

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.160

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.440
control the one guys lines like I was

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.330
born in the pot because my temperature

mad about I don't know what's going on

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.160
with that man with Trump daddy what's

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.750
happening he's doing good he's doing I

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.300
haven't followed the news no what's

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.220
going on I don't I can't tell I don't

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.870
know what's happening I don't think he's

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.200
the worst I don't think he's Hitler

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.930
mm-hmm you can face yeah you can say not

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.580
sure if he's Hitler yet I don't think he

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.200
says a lot of people said he was well

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.610
here's here's that dude the thing is I

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.100
don't think he's Hitler yet it's one of

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.350
the two things that's either actually

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.330
it's three things it's either he is

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.190
Hitler and he's undermining the press

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.270
and he's trying to like completely

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.060
manipulate you know hiring fascists

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.370
which is like all right sick as [ __ ]

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.440
that's one if he goes fascism I'm gonna

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.420
be first in line being like that's sick

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.030
that you did ruin best country in the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.370
world and became dictator do you hear

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.900
about people love install and I'm like

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.850
is this how this [ __ ] happens you just

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.170
slide anyway like nah dude I thought

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.520
he's pretty [ __ ] sick dude I don't

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.480
know I don't know whatever had a problem

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.250
with yeah for sure that's exactly how it

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.780
happens that's crazy but then it's like

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.680
or so that's one scenario or Hilary's

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.390
part of like a child molesting cabal of

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.540
deep state [ __ ] painkillers

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.640
just other that's the that's the

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.530
alternate side of this where it's like

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.850
nah dude you guys got it all wrong

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.350
there's a deep state they're lying and

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.430
they're stealing people and they sold

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.860
all the jobs overseas and it's like and

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.080
they stole kids out of Haiti so you

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.520
think it's one of those two things

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.650
because you're good or it's you

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.570
definitely need zactly Ords neither and

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.400
then it's like well what the [ __ ] yeah

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.420
it's not that's what it is

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.330
it's neither it's neither and he's just

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.640
a [ __ ] idiot that is the president

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.180
and what about Clinton Clinton yeah and

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.160
yeah if you want to hold politicians to

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.590
civilian standards most of them are

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.870
criminals yeah fair enough

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.390
you know Bush is a war criminal then

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:15.200
yeah but with a little I always hear war

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.120
criminal and I'm like you know it's like

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.350
what exactly does that entail

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.510
I think drone coming up with the drone

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.160
program and just [ __ ] no not the

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.440
drone program necessarily but yes I mean

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.880
bombing like weddings that's a pretty

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.950
bad card but like what's a weird that's

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.780
not like a battle lying me lying about

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.990
an threat like WMDs in Iraq clearly

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.000
fabricating that yeah to start a war in

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.350
Iraq true that that's war criminal

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.600
status no it's also like you hear about

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.280
like the Revolutionary War and Civil War

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.780
and it's like Battle of the Bulge and it

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.100
was like they got up on a hill they're

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.270
like all right we're gonna have a war

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.550
down and now it's just like is that a

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.230
battle technically when like a robot

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.910
comes up and just [ __ ] blasts a

00:05:52.910 --> 00:06:00.890
wedding and they like just catch it on

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.240
the electric slide like damn there's

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.940
songs [ __ ] sick yeah damn I wonder

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.890
how many of those started with like cuz

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.420
I was just out of wedding like you know

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.700
that moment where once I come dance it's

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.390
like I don't

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.790
every time I dance it sucks like no come

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.320
on and then you while you're walking out

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.260
it was like yeah boom robot and then

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.520
you're just like picking up your wife

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.460
yeah it's a tough life it's a tough

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.320
thing I just like I've seen a couple

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.680
wedding videos where the floor collapses

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.180
like a bunch of [ __ ] Indians just

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.100
packed into a [ __ ] dance floor they

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.810
dance a little hard that the floor

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.310
[ __ ] collapses what if they're just

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.620

alley dirt track win a race closest to

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.230
the edge of the cliff playing chicken

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.720
[Laughter]

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.270
today we were driving home from this

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.920
wedding and Phil was driving my dad was

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.690
driving and there was he had to go

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.790
straight at this intersection the right

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.260
lane had a turn right only and there was

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.880
a car in front and he just mentally

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.190
[ __ ] collapsed like he started to get

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.870
in the right lane and then he saw that

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.930
it was right all these it was like oh

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.520
like switched lanes like I've never seen

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.140
like that he did want to put like a dick

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.730
head move and go [ __ ] from a turning

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.040
lane yeah so instead he like panicked

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.900
and just kept driving well try

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.030
everything he's ever hated for years

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:58.909
here's a car

00:19:58.909 --> 00:20:00.409
he had to slam on the brakes and like

00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:02.570
the traction control like took a like

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.849
antilock brakes took over it was like

00:20:04.849 --> 00:20:08.239
what the [ __ ] are you doing as he was

00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:10.399
Jodie's by flashing like Stevie probably

00:20:10.399 --> 00:20:11.960
saw Puerto Rican due to the mirror I was

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.710
like yeah but then he made this like

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.690
crazy I've never seen my dad do it he

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.269
made like a weird nervous like when I

00:20:20.269 --> 00:20:21.679
looked down cuz I was in shock and I was

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.059
like what the [ __ ] was that he was like

00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:27.769
oh he slipped it was like are you

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:30.950
alright he was like but it was the first

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.299
I think it was like the first real sign

00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:35.989
of old age I've seen him did you drive

00:20:35.989 --> 00:20:38.450
yeah yeah sure sure dude that [ __ ]

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.059
that's yeah that's it sucks through any

00:20:41.059 --> 00:20:42.409
like especially we don't see your dad

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:43.700
for a while and he come back and you see

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.409
like a lot of age in your face like oh

00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:47.179
[ __ ] you becoming like old as hell now

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:49.609
yeah dude it was sad cuz then he let me

00:20:49.609 --> 00:20:52.249
come a senior citizen he the way he did

00:20:52.249 --> 00:20:54.019
it yeah like he was kept accelerating

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:56.570
and they had car in front of us so like

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.679
while he was trying to make up his mind

00:20:57.679 --> 00:20:59.479
which lane yes he's all ring and then he

00:20:59.479 --> 00:21:01.909
jammed on the brakes on his [ __ ] and I

00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:04.479
looked at him and he was like

00:21:04.479 --> 00:21:06.440
embarrassed of course

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.499
yeah but normally he's an [ __ ]

00:21:08.499 --> 00:21:10.940
doesn't do that but he got probably

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.080
doesn't do that he doesn't strike me as

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.210
like a like a reckless driver

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.879
like [ __ ] avoids highways we took we

00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:18.859
hear it's crazy it takes like back roads

00:21:18.859 --> 00:21:21.440
let's tie it kind of [ __ ] annoying

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.029
especially now you have Google Maps you

00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:27.409
can see how much time he just had like

00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:29.509
yeah sure shame that crushes old men of

00:21:29.509 --> 00:21:31.399
being like this is all shortcut yeah

00:21:31.399 --> 00:21:32.899
you're looking like nope this is 23

00:21:32.899 --> 00:21:36.859
minutes a day all right like that thing

00:21:36.859 --> 00:21:38.450
like that thing knows that thing yeah

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.239
but I've been driving for 47 years

00:21:41.239 --> 00:21:43.609
that's my dad's favorite thing I've been

00:21:43.609 --> 00:21:45.889
driving for 46 years the thing I like to

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:47.239
know and you're like nap this is science

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:49.129
dude and it definitely says that this is

00:21:49.129 --> 00:21:51.859
long as [ __ ] that sucks man seeing him

00:21:51.859 --> 00:21:54.109
get old is kind of like he and he was

00:21:54.109 --> 00:21:58.519
like ashamed mm-hmm was I good I mean

00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:00.080
that's all yeah that's how they end up

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.759
[ __ ] running like four people over in

00:22:01.759 --> 00:22:03.919
a church parking lot sure see that

00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:05.929

just the club pro was in front of us at

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.480
the clubhouse and he hit the [ __ ] he

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.670
didn't put it in reverse slam to the gas

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.860
put the pro pin to the pro against the

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.530
wall and we're still accelerating in the

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:37.080

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:42.870
where you'd leave reality so he's

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.100

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.670
there's very specific instructions of

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.140
like you're in like a hallway you walk

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.760

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.050
talks to you and you make a left

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.490

Tibetan the hallway just [ __ ] like

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:25.880

video on Facebook of Chinese people

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.430
putting rats into the food and I just

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.970

the fork yeah can you not eat chopsticks

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:08.410

01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:09.880
I like cuz it slows me down especially

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.040

whatever's in there that's why I can't

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.220
if I don't use a chopstick if I just use

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.080
a fork and I eat my meal in like three

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.430
minutes and realize how much I just paid

01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:29.530
for basically a bunch of rice and like

01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:32.500

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.500
got done with chopsticks because there

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.390
were chopsticks in a fork and then she

01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:53.859

she might have said she couldn't speak a

01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:08.140
[ __ ] any English that's why all she

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:11.650
understood each other's there's also a

01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:13.180
young Chinese boy trying to learn

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:15.310
English on his [ __ ] like iPad well is

01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:20.619

01:02:20.619 --> 01:02:23.319
trying to press buttons it'd be to move

01:02:23.319 --> 01:02:25.060
tables it was so annoying we're talking

01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.500

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:33.160
because that's more annoying than any

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.650
other minority playing music at a

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:36.130
restaurant

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:37.660

Asian imagine trying to learn English

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:41.829

like lil uzi bird welcome Chinese

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:44.530

01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:51.089
it [ __ ] racist it's basically the

01:02:51.089 --> 01:02:53.050
stereotype of white people that we walk

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:55.990
around all day in or like yeah that's

01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:58.390
what happens that's funny too that way

01:02:58.390 --> 01:03:00.190

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:03.400
white people being like shut up oh for

kind of get randomly get your autograph

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.079
well dude what they teach in schools now

01:03:17.079 --> 01:03:21.970
is that like white people are like every

01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:23.349
people just raised their hands all day

01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:25.450
and talked about people being racist

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:27.700
they're just like one time is it this

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:29.530
thing and it's like white guy it was

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:31.690
like saying stuff like oh my god I can't

01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:33.700
believe it and it's just like all the

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:34.839
stories and I was raising my hand I'm

01:03:34.839 --> 01:03:36.190
like you know like all the races do this

01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:37.950
[ __ ] too right and they're just like no

01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:41.619
yeah no they go slightly clear examples

01:03:41.619 --> 01:03:43.089
and they're like yeah but that's not

01:03:43.089 --> 01:03:46.450
racism that's prejudice that's like okay

01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:47.890
so that thing they do where they like

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:49.540
judge people by their skin that's still

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.280
you know pretty similar so it's totally

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:51.670
different

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:53.710
yeah do you guys work for Korean guys

01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:55.630
who would literally just like

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:57.550
any other ethnicity would be like

01:03:57.550 --> 01:03:59.740

think is number one well in the Asian

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.650
world Japanese kind of hold themselves

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:13.240
up is like and like even like I don't

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.040
want Koreans will be like Japanese women

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.050
they're so beautiful so beautiful but

01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:18.790
it's like they hold it down like

01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:20.470
Japanese people are like yeah I still

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:22.570

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:57.490
scrubbed you it's real quiet you don't

01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:58.570
hear much about it but like you'll just

01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:00.040
hear like China bans the internet and

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.820
you're like alright I guess I was

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:05.770
American immigrant podcast this girl was

01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:07.420
like we were talking about how China is

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.240
setting up like a new silk

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.250
like the way they're like what they're

01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:14.290
doing is they're buying like ports or

01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:16.359
like plots of land in other countries

01:06:16.359 --> 01:06:18.190
and giving them a loan to build the port

01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:19.990
knowing that they won't be able to pay

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:21.790
America it's a market that's what we did

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:23.380
forever no China's doing yeah for sure

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.850
but this girl was like good

01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:28.750
I hope they pass us I'm like you think

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:31.180
chai you preferred China to America

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:34.930
because of why like police brutality in

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:35.970
America I'm like dude they're [ __ ]

01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:38.740
he's over there try to dissent over

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:42.670
there yeah somewhat there was I heard

01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:43.869
something like that where they're saying

01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:46.540
how like something America was doing and

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.030
I think was something going on in Africa

01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:51.400
or like it was politically just too hot

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.660
where they're trying to liked happen

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.130
it's doing something like that yeah give

01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:56.080
some money countries loans and then they

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.160
you know they can't repay you build

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.270
infrastructure and then you're like all

01:06:58.270 --> 01:06:59.770
right we all your natural resources yeah

01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:02.830
uh Confessions of an economic hitman

01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:06.010
writes all about it owners but the but

01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:07.030
that was reading this thing and they're

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:08.109
saying like America was doing something

01:07:08.109 --> 01:07:09.160
like that in Africa but like the

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.570
political climb it was so hot it like

01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:12.070
you know we got to shut it down China

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.230
this came in as a [ __ ] down yeah

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.650
exactly

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:16.750
China's taking Africa and Middle East

01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:19.720
yeah yeah and everyone just like Dan's

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.690
good yeah good America is an evil empire

01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:24.400
it's like dude wait till you see what

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.160
those boys do yeah it's what they're

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.570
gonna do that's dude that's the one

01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:30.100
thing like a lot of people just can't

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.780
see there it's like no it's not it's

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.550
like you guys have it they build all

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:37.359
their world views on like 1800 onwards

01:07:37.359 --> 01:07:39.820
as if like that's when all the bad

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.670
should happen it's like what modern yeah

01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:43.990
of course a lot of like the critical

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:46.390
race Theory all that [ __ ] yeah it's all

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:47.680
predicated on like and then there was

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.300
white people and did all this [ __ ] and

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:51.400
it's like like whiteness is a thing now

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.400
that's race is a social construct so

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.260
white people invent a trace yeah we've

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:56.980
talked about this before

01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:59.350
white people made up race and it's a

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:01.330
total [ __ ] why why is that being

01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:03.720
passed around as acceptable to say I

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.800
guess from like someone looked at like a

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.440
Portuguese journal and was like like it

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.100
makes no sense from but aside from that

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.530
it's like so like whiteness is a thing

01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:15.520
this is how they get around it that

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.839
effect that it's like racist what

01:08:16.839 --> 01:08:18.160
they're teaching is like whiteness is a

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.529
thing separate from race but it's

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:23.240
whiteness and it's like a destructive

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.100
that's like the reason pretty much for

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.750
all of our problems in America yeah and

01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:29.540
it's like I mean if you didn't if you

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.220
just go back to like the mongolians it's

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:32.660
like so what do they do they just

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:34.970
somehow like yeah they they just got

01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:36.710
whiteness outside of this is like

01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:38.180
specter of race that we made out in

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.430
entire cities they should chop people's

01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:41.750
ears off and count the [ __ ] death

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.180
toll it's a slight weakness they had

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:44.960
whiteness in them

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.670
yeah then but you say that it's like

01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:48.380
that was different that was different

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:52.220
back yeah is this kind of like it just

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:53.450
none of it holds up as soon as you bring

01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:55.220
it up people are just like I disagree

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:58.070
and honestly it's prejudiced it's not

01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:59.630
racism and it's just like all right man

01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:02.780
whatever and what the [ __ ] sometimes I'm

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:04.460
the fly on the wall baby girls slightly

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.200
on that tip she's young enough to be

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.160
like that's when she was indoctrinated

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.530
and like well here's and here's the

01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:11.390
thing it's like you don't think you have

01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:14.630
white privilege like yeah why are we

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:17.480
talking about yeah my whole thing is

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.420
like no I I why is it just called

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:22.160
privilege then it's like if you inherit

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.440
a bunch of money you're privileged but

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.970
then it's like yeah you get pulled over

01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:27.020
less okay

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.180
I'll take that for sure but then it's

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:32.030
like it's just weird cuz then it's like

01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:34.070
well if someone gets up every day and

01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:35.990
goes to work and [ __ ] works out for them

01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:38.330
like if you just take white people and

01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:39.800
it's like the fact that we're

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.240
economically stratified we're like

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:42.680
people do some people do really poorly

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.270
some people do really well that's like

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:46.100
if you happen to do a lot of stuff

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:47.180
you're supposed to do you end up on the

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:48.590
you more or less end up where you do

01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:49.700
really well if something really horrible

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.710
happens so it's like the white people

01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:52.940
who do better than other white people

01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:54.320
have more white privilege and other

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.090
white people or is it just the fact that

01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:57.860
they're you know it's like gets hazy

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.050
those those arguments and they're the

01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:02.690
arguments that fuel like that whole

01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:04.370
thing of like we're under our races

01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:06.260
under attack but that's [ __ ] white

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:08.030
supremacy yeah it's the same [ __ ]

01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:09.770
logic so I just sit there and almost

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:14.720
kind of like mmm my thing is what I've

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.180
started to realize is capitalism is

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:17.870
gonna fall

01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:21.380
I'm capitalism capitalism replaced

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:24.740
feudalism yeah so it's like it's bad a

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.590
nice run will be socialist for sure in

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:29.150
like 20 years America be a socialist

01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:31.400
country and if someone can figure out a

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.630
nice middle ground I mean there's like

01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:34.910
ethically responsible capitalism where

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:35.990
people have been trying to push like

01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.740
Tom's

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.180
shoes and [ __ ] where they like will

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.040
basella [ __ ] will give a shoe to a

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.930
[ __ ] african kid yeah I don't know

01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:43.310
and I still be millionaires that's like

01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:46.010
disagree you don't think when [ __ ] hits

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:48.530
the fan which it probably will in the

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:51.770
next twenty fifty years yeah it's

01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:55.370
capitalism again well whatever we're

01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:57.740
back to like clan wars utilize aphorism

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:00.020
if we need to true what will happen if

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.750
[ __ ] gets hard enough yeah so I I wonder

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:04.550
if that's what happened what just the

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:06.140
natural progression of like we had a

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.210
nice [ __ ] democracy and then it is

01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:10.610
over time every democracy just grows so

01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:13.340
polarized towards like fascism socialism

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:16.910
like whatever maybe so my head no what

01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:18.200
happened this much just be the natural

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.130
lifespan dude maybe capitalism you know

01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:24.170
goes into one of those every time but

01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:26.540
dude if bases go back to [ __ ]

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:28.640
monarchies but dude then you throw I

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:32.330
have to I would look okay dude became I

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:34.640
my thing is if robots here's the here's

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:35.630
the problem though do you think the

01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:37.550
robots are gonna do I don't know dude so

01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:39.050
then if we have there's a trump robot

01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:40.580
though I the only thing the only good

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:43.190
thing that could happen if the only good

01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:44.560
thing that could happen is that if

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.150
robots buck against us at people unite

01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:48.500
against robots that's like best-case

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.420
scenario for the human race yeah the

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.070
granite they don't take us out or

01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:55.760
problem a tree wind they might dude they

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.620
might not they might not if we get to

01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:00.170
the motherboard dude do you think I mean

01:12:00.170 --> 01:12:01.970
I think I have a pretty good I think I

01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:04.280
was born to like fight robots I'm pretty

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.020
sure I was we could fast forward to this

01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:08.090
dystopia where you just instantly

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:10.580
explode in solutely like a robot sees

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:12.620
you you finally come up with a plan to

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.510
get to the motherboard first step out

01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:16.850
your door yeah they would I would

01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:18.170
definitely just say something over my

01:12:18.170 --> 01:12:21.440
cell phone and yeah Beria's I was

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.180
talking to spot the other devices is up

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:24.980
against I know didn't fight in the robot

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:27.080
war basically are dude I love the idea

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.520
that we killed their [ __ ] social

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.200
media guy that's exactly what he did

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.490
today really I got hit with a drone

01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:33.320
strike he was [ __ ] I'm just a social

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.000
media guy had hit a while ago yeah it

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.920
was popping off tweets next thing you

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.330
know a [ __ ] robot came through the

01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:40.070
ceiling and that's that's funny that

01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:41.690
that's weird that commits a crime that

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:43.460
was a battle did yeah that was a battle

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.710
he was tweeting he's like put posting

01:12:45.710 --> 01:12:47.360
pictures of like dead troops in Iraq and

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.740
he was like you guys are next they were

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:49.750
just like a robot was

01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:53.290
Yeah right see whatever Doradus pod

01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:55.540
recently about simulation theory he was

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.670
it was actually a really funny point we

01:12:57.670 --> 01:12:58.990
just talked like Joe Rogan was talking

01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:01.000
about the Elan musk I watched that Elon

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.880
Musk is I love you on musk he's pretty

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.240
cool

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.040
it was weird they had a lot of pauses

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.640
where it'd be like yes I think you know

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.380
most weird I I didn't know he's from

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.370
South Africa I'm liking this guy

01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:20.620
[ __ ] lady would talk he'd be like

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.120
makes sense with his [ __ ] name I

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.080
thought he liked a speech impediment

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.570
yeah you know South Africa white guy

01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:28.540
dude he had him he had him home brewed

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:31.180
there that must be real if he around

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.100
they're just like if you're a white dude

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:38.440
South Africa trying to get that brewed

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.080
yo bro but he but I'm starting to spot

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.460
about the simulation theory and he was

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.590
like yeah the only thing that like that

01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:46.000
falls apart for me is like he's like

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.130
when I think of my life I'm like who the

01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:54.670
[ __ ] programmed this my dog ran away

01:13:54.670 --> 01:13:56.980
it's like Mouse's are meeting every now

01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:58.510
and again it gets out of the house they

01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:59.710
like run off dude

01:13:59.710 --> 01:14:01.690
yeah it's due to solaris and then like

01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:03.070
it'll like run out on the little roof

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:04.840
parapet and like look over and like come

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.070
back and be like holy [ __ ] there's a dog

01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:07.570
on the roof I'll come in and just be

01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:09.760
like dude who the [ __ ] programmed this

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.710
and why you think it makes sense for

01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:15.790
like Joe Rogan to them to he's like yeah

01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:17.020
I just get letters all the time from the

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.680
city like we're taking your house that's

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.510
kind of an argument that was made

01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:25.090
against God forever true - sorry why the

01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:27.670
[ __ ] did God do this trio life sucks

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:29.700
that's true [ __ ] is his problem

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:32.350
you're bad simulations just a test bro

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:34.150
you displease them maybe wants to throw

01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:35.740
a bunch of [ __ ] all I have to do is

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.450
[ __ ] punch through this computer

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:39.460
screen dude and weirdest anyway we're in

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.020
the [ __ ] Tibetan hallway do just like

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:50.070
dad you can see my dad arguing but uh

01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:52.690
yeah came up with a sick theory to that

01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:54.370
so far every single person's agreed with

01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:56.200
like everybody already knew it Trump's

01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:00.070
autistic he's definitely something dude

01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:02.110
look at the way he

01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:06.490
Trump's artistic potential

01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:09.280
did you ask that weird with no booze or

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.620
drugs it's fair he's crushing McDonald's

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:14.530
on private yes he [ __ ] watch him try

01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:16.840
to act like go watch him like when he

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.330
was on WWF there's a weirdest [ __ ] and

01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:20.710
it makes sense he got all that money and

01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:21.970
they're like you can do anything Donnell

01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:23.830
what would you like to do is like I want

01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:27.550
to be in an airplane airplane with

01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:30.430
McDonnell did you see his uh his when he

01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:31.420
addressed people was a hurricane

01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.970
Florence yeah - did you see his leg when

01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:35.110
he like came out of the White House and

01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:37.210
like addressed the camera he came out

01:15:37.210 --> 01:15:38.980
and he was like hurricane Florence is

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:41.680
huge probably the reddest in terms of

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.480
water we'd ever had now it's like dude

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.790
are you [ __ ] around is this a joke it

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:47.350
dude it was pretty [ __ ] funny -

01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:51.060
definitely the wettest in terms of water

01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:54.280
I heard these ladies today was when I

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.960
was leaving the hotel - [ __ ] ladies

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.640
were in front of me walking up these

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.080
steps and I heard them talking about

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.390
that and lady [ __ ] up the quote she's

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:02.410
like did you hear what he said yesterday

01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:04.690
mm-hmm it was like there's more water

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:06.730
it's like yeah it's a hurricane you

01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:09.070
[ __ ] idiot yeah I was like I don't

01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:10.540
even look at what he says anymore he's

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.580
so dumb and I was behind them just like

01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:18.910
20/20 he would crush you - shut up we

01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:20.800
all might be autistic billionaire we all

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.330
might be autistic - every billionaire

01:16:22.330 --> 01:16:25.360
that might be what the majors fool dude

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.790
D Trump fool Altis autism is hot right

01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:28.030
now

01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:29.890
autism is [ __ ] you take over the world

01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:33.310
no to be tight if autism becomes so sick

01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:34.720
that you get like young white kids from

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.100
the suburbs like pretending to be out

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.210
like how like young white kids used to

01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:39.100
pretend to be black now now like feel

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.660
like pretending to be out this account

01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:47.350
account trying you front like you're

01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.860
autistic

01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.810
I think we're and that's the autistic

01:16:49.810 --> 01:16:51.250
matrix dude we're probably all in the

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:52.900
we're probably all kind of autistic I

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.270
mean I guess it's yeah it's a spectrum

01:16:55.270 --> 01:17:06.220
I'm sick that big I've never met an

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.930
autistic person I don't like no no

01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:10.390
Trump's autistic a moment I'm sorry I

01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:12.580
got to do more research on that makes

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:14.260
sense oh yeah always watch him try to

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:14.920
make him

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:18.429
Oshin well yes don't try to make any

01:17:18.429 --> 01:17:19.600
that's what he that's what he does he

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.400
ever like they're like Donald Trump

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.160
you're my favorite person he goes I

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.390
don't know those no idea what he's doing

01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:28.350
emotionally the guy he's unplugged true

01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:30.850
yeah he's no [ __ ] that was what I was

01:17:30.850 --> 01:17:32.320
thinking about too like when he had a go

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.300
talk about the hurricane I'm like this

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.760
guy has to like get into the headspace

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.260
to pretend to give a [ __ ] about a

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.880
hurricane yeah like I don't give a [ __ ]

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:43.300
93 speech did you really think you just

01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.870
tried to be like what your families did

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.469
was amazing

01:17:47.469 --> 01:17:51.969
true heroes never forget about it could

01:17:51.969 --> 01:17:56.140
be great on this beautiful Pennsylvania

01:17:56.140 --> 01:18:02.890
field he doesn't weird watch him clap

01:18:02.890 --> 01:18:04.960
and point at people when he walks out to

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.130
a speech when people are clapping it's

01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:10.000
like he doesn't like to be touched you

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.010
crazy dress up yeah

01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:14.650
he only pounds be autistic it's good

01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:16.780
that's fair enough dude I'm definitely

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:19.600
watching him through that lens dude and

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.880
you'll see I must be crazy for him to to

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.469
like go to rallies have all those people

01:18:23.469 --> 01:18:25.030
coming out and chanting him watch how he

01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:26.800
what when when you see him in a rally

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.420
like that watch how he responds to the

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:32.110
crowd he does all these weird that's

01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:36.120
true it's also a 7 year old white guy

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:43.540
[ __ ] gay every 7 year old white guy

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.940
becomes gay his blood was trying to

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:46.660
avoid dude

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:48.429
bud was getting old enough he could feel

01:18:48.429 --> 01:18:49.780
he was gay an autistic and he's just

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:51.910
like you know what [ __ ] he probably saw

01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:59.140
some dudes ass in the bleachers oh yeah

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:03.969
man that is it was funny cuz I would be

01:19:03.969 --> 01:19:05.080
like dude he's not as dumb as you think

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.640
you get and then I watched the hurricane

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.620
thing and it was like him being like

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:10.150
definitely the wettest in terms of water

01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:13.449
we'd ever had what the [ __ ] is this guy

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:14.199
talking about

01:19:14.199 --> 01:19:17.560
he's dude I have to find it I'll show

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.390
this yes it's so fun I heard I heard

01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:21.370
about it it's so fun I watched that and

01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:23.670
I was like

01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:28.690
[ __ ] stupid thinking is every time

01:19:28.690 --> 01:19:29.739
they like you sure you don't want to
