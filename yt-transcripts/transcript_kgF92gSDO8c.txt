00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.280
secret cast stick over yeah it was fun

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.640

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.120

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.480
too pleased about

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.720
like harboring resentment ever since

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.159
you've been fighting that dirk dog

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.840
doesn't mind taking it once or twice

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.959
in the old keister by a lady

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.640
by a lady that's a very key detail are

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.879
you homophobic bro yeah

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.040
no that makes sense it's your yeah you

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.480
should choose if yeah it gets to dawn

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.519
you out versus a hot babe

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.440
exactly not really attractive as a guy

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.879
so it's not

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.120
attractive so you would not have a hot

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.319
guy dong you out

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.120
nah probably not what in terms of the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.560
guide dogging you was it just more of

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.519
like you don't want him to come

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.400
everywhere

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.080
that does sound messy that's a drawback

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.920
for me yeah for sure [ __ ] see if i feel

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.799
like i don't want to smell

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.360
[ __ ] that's my thing yeah smelling no

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.920
condom

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.319
huh no condom hell yeah oh if i'm

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.159
getting donked out it's wrong i'm wrong

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.959
right that's gotta be one of the

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.439
benefits for sure yeah yeah anal sex is

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.040
meant for right you can't have a condom

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.159
yeah what's the worst that could happen

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.920
with just men having anal sex with other

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.239
men

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.390
that's true unprotected more can't be

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.750
[Laughter]

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.240
oh my god you're [ __ ] dunking me out

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.680

so durkin admitted to me and matt that

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.620
he doesn't mind getting donged out

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.400
[Laughter]

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.520
by a lady that's comfortable with yeah

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.880
now this isn't what about lady do you

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.040

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.800
lady a lady would strap attack you

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.360
strap attack rape that seems tough i

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.000

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.240
protect myself you gonna clench your

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.040

also dildos aren't that hard

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.759
yes stillers are too squishy to strap

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.280
attacks they need a lot of help i feel

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.560
like i would see the rape coming as

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.840
they're like lubing up or something you

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.760
really is yeah after a while i said how

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.720

about in girl brain

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.440
yeah i feel that also knocking head is

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.079
exactly

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.480
that's frustrating you gotta ask for it

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.440
and then it's weird

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.040
yeah and then it's like you know that

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.639
it's a chore for them yeah

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:52.240

after like

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.959

and head with babes they eventually are

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.040
kind of like i don't want to do it

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.399
i think right away because yeah

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:12.639
they're done trying to impress you yeah

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:13.600

i mean i you would think it'd be great

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.920
after a while then it drops down to 1d

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.600
it's a quick head yeah and then

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.279
eventually when you're married it's head

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:31.760

the gay mafia and the uh catholic church

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.520

00:27:15.919 --> 00:27:18.480
oh no yeah i i was reading one talk i

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.360
was reading like a

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.960
interview a different interview with him

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.640
he's like i don't act

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.399
he's just like i don't act well

00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:25.919
apparently john wayne like they did like

00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:26.480
a

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.240
colonoscopy when he died and he had this

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.559
like compacted [ __ ] beef in his his

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:31.039
colon was

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:32.720
like he had like 40 pounds of just like

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.240
unpassed fecal matter in his body

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.760
yeah i remember that yeah so i think

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.440
that's an urban legend nah dude it's

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:37.760
real

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.559
i think i think it was hot dogs i think

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:41.840
the urban legend was like

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.399
30 pounds of hot dogs for john wayne's

00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:45.279
ass

00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:47.440
no john wayne doesn't act he doesn't act

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.960
dude

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.399
that's so funny that they like they cut

00:27:50.399 --> 00:27:52.080
him open they're like it's hot dogs it's

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.159
all hot dogs this man was a giant hot

00:27:54.159 --> 00:27:56.320
dog way that way those hot dogs we need

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.000
a record of how much hot dogs john wayne

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.080
has in his body that's probably better

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.799
now i'm less surprised what that he

00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:03.360
would

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.919
be saying it also could be a side effect

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.360
that could be a side effect of like

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.200
excessive nitrate intake

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.320

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:55.119
underlings went against him he should

00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:56.320
have murdered them as soon as he should

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:56.560
have

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.320
did the plot and then backstabbed them

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.240

well 3 600. that's the old nigerian

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.839
dilemma dude

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.760
what he didn't give them like thirty

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.560

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.400
have turned around and double spin kick

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.119

a sick movie just like that dude that's

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.160
just content

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.160
it's hollywood dude it's another [ __ ]

fire ass [ __ ] ideas

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.280
coming right out of you it is it is

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.480
uncomfortable talking about tawan and

brawley dude

00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:51.040

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.280
nice plot like who would you [ __ ]

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.119
historically who would you take one from

00:48:01.119 --> 00:48:03.359
it would be a good one i let joan of arc

00:48:03.359 --> 00:48:07.839

is medieval strap wait you're talking

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.680

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.079
or

00:48:26.079 --> 00:48:27.920
i think that was pretty original i think

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.119
the first strap was

00:48:29.119 --> 00:48:31.680
not exactly the same i would have caught

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.599
like a literal peg from from the bottom

00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:34.559
that's what i'm talking about

00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:36.079
turtlemark oh she might have just fisted

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.920

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.800
hands

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.839

00:48:39.839 --> 00:48:42.640
leather gloved me amelia earhart hitting

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.200

00:48:54.559 --> 00:48:55.359
here's the thing

00:48:55.359 --> 00:48:58.000
so this is the [ __ ] this is this this

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.119
is a scenario

00:48:59.119 --> 00:49:01.440
he's so mad so this is the scenario you

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.880
could kill hitler

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.160
but you've got to let him [ __ ] you and

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.160
come inside you ten times

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.400
you have his ten times on the tenth and

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.760
the eve of the tenth night you could

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.119
slip him and [ __ ] blade in the neck

00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:12.240

in you not in you and he's very hitler's

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.240
very flatulent too

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.599
really a lot of people don't know this

00:49:21.599 --> 00:49:25.040
hitler was a very flatulent man

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.319
he farted a lot he said flatulence no no

00:49:28.319 --> 00:49:31.200

00:49:35.119 --> 00:49:37.520
no he was very flatulent like his

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.559
biographer said like

00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:39.760
that was one thing they noted like

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.079
hitler farted a lot interesting so he

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.520
was giving speeches you couldn't hear

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.319
like

00:49:44.319 --> 00:49:46.000
that's why he screamed yeah dude he was

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
coming on hide that noise so he'd be

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.119
[ __ ] pumping and just

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:50.640

getting on first couple times i was on

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.200
the megabus i was genuinely true i've

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:45.440
only

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.880
i've only read it like twice yeah that

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.359
was it was still exciting i sat up top

00:54:49.359 --> 00:54:51.119
in the front on one i was like this is

00:54:51.119 --> 00:54:52.640
this is crazy yeah

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.240
and then you're in the front yeah you

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.160
can do that yeah second level you sit in

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.599
the front you get that glass

00:54:57.599 --> 00:54:59.359
what yeah and there's yes it's like the

00:54:59.359 --> 00:55:01.440
pope mobile kind of thing

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.200
what's that to do like is that like

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.720

to i was actually uh talking to blizz

01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.840
i'm going to try to get a mathematician

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:03.040
um to talk about exciting podcasts i was

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:03.920
gonna argue

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:05.199
i was gonna get a mathematician in here

01:31:05.199 --> 01:31:07.360
and act like i'm like an mit like robo a

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.040
robotics guy

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.719
just like started talking madness yeah

01:31:10.719 --> 01:31:12.480
by the way this is gonna be a

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.080
30 second maybe no dude try to get one

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:17.679
sentence

01:31:17.679 --> 01:31:21.470
first of all i studied robos

01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:25.440
[Laughter]

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.600
i actually went to mit i studied

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.199
robotnik's

01:31:29.199 --> 01:31:32.800
dr robotnik was my was my professor uh

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:34.400
well yeah inside of all robotnik's

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:35.920
there's little animals that pop out

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.840
yeah yeah i'm gonna try to i want to get

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:38.800
a mathematician i want to get a

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.360
mathematician on to explain chaos theory

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.960
i want to get i also want to debate

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.400
someone about probability

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:45.840
i don't [ __ ] buy it probability

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:47.760
theory i was googling [ __ ] black

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.360
israelites in philly to try to get them

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:49.920
on

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:51.920
that'd be probably perfect i could do a

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.840
mobile cast tough to get a hold of them

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.120
they don't have like their cell phones

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.360
they're pretty secluded

01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:01.120
they're tough what yeah what's the email

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.280

on the street they could use the audio

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:06.639
equipment

01:32:06.639 --> 01:32:13.840
yeah dude if we if we could just get one

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:22.080
i love those guys yeah yeah

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.239
i [ __ ] support them dude my favorite

01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:26.239
moment with the black israelites ever

01:32:26.239 --> 01:32:26.960
was like some

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.080
black friday they had like a

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:30.080
demonstration out and like in front of

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:30.560
their

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.400
stage and set up with like you know

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:33.840
they're like speaking with all their

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.040
terrible audio equipment

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:37.520
there's some white dude in sunglasses

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:39.280
just like walking back and forth in

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.480
front of their stage with like

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.239
with a sign said like white people the

01:32:42.239 --> 01:32:44.560
devil and he's like yeah we're terrible

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.320
like they're right oh my god he was

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.280
supported he was trying to join the

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:48.320
squad yeah but he was

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.480
so trolling them oh man that was the

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.800
best well he was just dying

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.840
they were like because they were

01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:56.320
annoying because he was like on message

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.159
he was getting in on the action but he

01:32:58.159 --> 01:32:59.760
was like everything they hated

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:01.440
i mean that's kind of exactly what this

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.960
would be if a black israelite came in

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:05.280
here we would support him

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:07.840
dude they would get suspicious entirely

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:10.000
i might have a black israelite versus a

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.840
mathematician i mean if we could if we

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:13.280
could actually start

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:16.800
yeah mathematician

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.080
oh my god why did these realize no

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.760
sacred geometry dude what a black

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:22.000
israelite would do to a mathematician is

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.639
nothing short of billy versus oh contact

01:33:24.639 --> 01:33:26.400
it would be that level of just like stop

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.280
you got to stop stop

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.320
true that all right so uh march 14th

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.159
come out to the live podcast at helium
