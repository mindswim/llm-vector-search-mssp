00:20:25.159 --> 00:20:27.869

00:20:27.869 --> 00:20:30.509
two hours how I said good night cuz I

00:20:30.509 --> 00:20:31.649

dude is walking through my bedroom I'm

00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:44.099
like dude so the other thing that you

00:20:44.099 --> 00:20:46.399
brought up I forget I think this is from

00:20:46.399 --> 00:20:48.509
you know you're like how is this [ __ ]

00:20:48.509 --> 00:20:50.070
really affecting me this much and bought

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.479
with all the right it stuff bro I

00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:55.139
started reading a book about it's Jaron

00:20:55.139 --> 00:20:57.570
Jaron Lanier 10 reasons why she shut

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.940
down your social media accounts bro I

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.239
mean I knew Facebook was [ __ ] weird I

00:21:03.239 --> 00:21:04.799
didn't know exactly how it worked

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:07.769
dude it's designed specifically parts of

00:21:07.769 --> 00:21:08.879
it are designed specifically with that

00:21:08.879 --> 00:21:10.619
purpose just to create like animosity

00:21:10.619 --> 00:21:12.809
between to be between people to where

00:21:12.809 --> 00:21:14.759
it's like they like to - oh my god I

00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:16.739
can't even [ __ ] so the one who told

00:21:16.739 --> 00:21:19.229
me the Zionists puppeteers are creating

00:21:19.229 --> 00:21:22.200
a social network to divide the it's not

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.259
even just that it's like so they're

00:21:25.259 --> 00:21:26.879
ripple effects the whole that so

00:21:26.879 --> 00:21:29.459
Facebook is a platform they're like

00:21:29.459 --> 00:21:31.259
people think like as a user they're the

00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:33.329
customer of Facebook not [ __ ] true

00:21:33.329 --> 00:21:35.669
you know I'm saying it's like it's like

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:37.679
Mouse saying they like mice trying to

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:39.059
complain about like a moisture mousetrap

00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:41.129
dude yes like it's yeah the whole bus to

00:21:41.129 --> 00:21:42.629
catch you but you're not your user

00:21:42.629 --> 00:21:45.149
experience isn't like they use user

00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:46.380
experience to learn

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.610
more about you to sell that information

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.920
to other companies so the whole point of

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.900
social media is a two-tier system where

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.360
it's specifically set up to a dict the

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.580
user and a dopamine feedback loop and

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.290
that's not even like conspiracy that's

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.470
like it came out and said that they use

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.570
someone's like is this the same book is

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.360
the casino thing no no actually sounds a

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.900
lot like casinos tried to like sue

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.820
Facebook being like you guys stole our

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.210
the way we thought it was yeah so

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.770
Facebook used a bunch of like gambling

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.080
casino techniques to a dick the user and

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.440
then what they actually sell is the the

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.480
fact that they can manipulate behavior

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.220
in a way that's preferable to certain

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.780
advertisers and companies because

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.460
they're like so what they do is little

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.960
like so Louis they'll study like you

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.340
know what videos are watching all the

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.390
[ __ ] they have all your information on

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:34.770
your phone and then they'll find

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.660
patterns of like when you purchase and

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.940
they'll be like so we watch this is the

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.710
kind of stuff that he ingested like

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.600
content wise and then he bought this but

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.860
he when he was watching this stuff he

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.000
bought that and they try to figure out

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.740
like if it's just like pure happenstance

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.450
and then they start doing things or they

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.030
like well when he watches cat videos he

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.370
tends to buy like pajamas whatever so

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.920
let's show him more and more cat videos

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.390
and they'll sell like they'll have an

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:58.920
advertiser like here's your base these

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.480
people into your stuff we have a

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.310
platform we can we can manipulate their

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.660
behavior in a way that's favorable to

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.010
you and that's what the Canberra G

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.420
analytical thing was where they figured

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.640
out like they can sway elections like

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.560
they can they know how to show stuff and

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.240
they also do like that's why they ask

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.310
you're like they if you check your

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.080
profile they tell you what your they

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.850
think your political Ben is and they'll

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.010
purposely show they'll flood your feed

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.480
with people who have opposing political

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.250
views to like get people fired up if

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.450
that's something or they'll do like the

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.490
opposite thing works like a bubble Wow

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:27.960
they said like when they started that

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.280
they didn't know there was there's gonna

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.480
be like so much hatred they said like

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.160
the hatred online was like the fight

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.930
like oil just laying under the land and

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.160
then they put people on there be like

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.220
[ __ ] you mother it's it's a there's

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.210
you're dealing with a bunch of

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.640
Technology addicts who are like driven

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.590
by that like dopamine burst of attention

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.970
and like self validation but the other

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.590
part too is like when people blow up at

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:47.850
each other people get addicted to that

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.680
too yeah it's like a gambler likes to

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.270
win they also kind of like to lose in a

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.430
weird perverse way yeah so what ends up

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.960
happening this book says is that people

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.230
are more alert and actually looking for

00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:59.180
to be a

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.370
because they gain like a validation from

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.020
being offended and then they get to go

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.670
off and get all that social like

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.760
feedback of like yes yes good job yes so

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.840
he said like it creates an environment

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.040
where people are more likely to be

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.880
offended because we're just like

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.410
crackheads yeah

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.840
on some level or dick to this technology

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.070
and the way to get it is to be like a

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.960
[ __ ] [ __ ] and then that's like the

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.710
big payoff

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:21.620
dude it's it is [ __ ] nuts I was

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.210
reading this [ __ ] it was just like what

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.280
the [ __ ] yeah I stopped I stopped

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.040
Facebook I don't get on that yeah man I

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.320
used to get a nice dopamine off of or

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.900
reddit yeah that was a nice little bit

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.520
so that's a good run for a little well

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.040
Facebook's [ __ ] up because it's like

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.070
you're sitting you're creating like a

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.390
the reddit by the way is still hilarious

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:47.120
right it's the [ __ ] already the Facebook

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.380
thing's [ __ ] up because you're

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.770
building this like effigy it to your

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.750
silicon electronic version of yourself

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.390
that you just continuously serve in the

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:57.950
name of your own ego and then you're

00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.450
they're taking all that information and

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.340
just but it's the most [ __ ] up thing

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.080
and then there's but [ __ ] you with

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.640
all the information you provide in this

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.830
like feeble attempt to like gain

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.900
recognition on this platform that has

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.930
absolutely no like it doesn't pay off in

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.900
any other way but this weird like

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.730
validation current attacks in lights

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.350

offensive linemen on can be able to run

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.730
the whole time true but they'll also

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.230
murder if somebody gets it like a

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.850

so you got a bunch of people and a

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.160
halfway house someone snuck like a

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.870

there's just like top 40 dance hits

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:49.410
playing people then what

00:32:49.649 --> 00:32:52.619
like we just like Ed Sheeran playing in

00:32:52.619 --> 00:32:55.559

because there's like people are puking

00:33:08.759 --> 00:33:10.589
left and right probably what during

00:33:10.589 --> 00:33:16.769
parties huh they're dead it's party time

00:33:16.769 --> 00:33:18.450
that's definitely I always imagine that

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:19.649
is like when you see the movie like

00:33:19.649 --> 00:33:20.729
blade when everyone's I got to

00:33:20.729 --> 00:33:22.649
underground right that's that in real

00:33:22.649 --> 00:33:26.279
life never is like I can't breathe

00:33:26.279 --> 00:33:30.450
through all my mom if you do a high dose

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:33.169
of vampires

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.099
[Laughter]

00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:40.769
uh-huh every any time I go to Kensington

00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:42.599
now you see everybody just standing

00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:48.210
around nod now I'm just like - it's a

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:50.039
sick party to get high as [ __ ] stand

00:33:50.039 --> 00:33:52.369
by yourself

00:33:54.259 --> 00:33:56.820
McDonald's watch the bus go by again

00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.799
like it's party time

00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:03.809
there's awesome to imagine heroin users

00:34:03.809 --> 00:34:08.250
are what I mean that might be the allure

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:09.629
of heroin if you're dipping out you're

00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:11.010
probably just here the dancing queen in

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.549
your head it's like Abba song is like

00:34:13.549 --> 00:34:16.220
while you're nodding this it's coldest

gym shorts it's raining your head just

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.960
plays that's probably the allure of

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.789
heroin you go into a state where your

00:34:23.789 --> 00:34:25.589

like you know we're like which I don't

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.759
think is that crazy to say like you know

00:46:05.759 --> 00:46:06.240
we're the

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.770
dimension I'd this again I put the video

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:09.330
on the reddit of the tenth dimension and

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:12.300
like all the way up it's uh it could be

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.650
the case I mean it makes sense it like

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:14.610
you've seen an ant and it's like

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:16.020
crawling around has no idea what's going

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.180
on there has to be a level above us to

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.830
think that there's not as only Hebrew

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.869
stood pure hubris

00:46:21.869 --> 00:46:23.850
so there's definitely I think there

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.140
definitely is like it's you know six

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.180
dimension well the six dimension is just

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:27.930
[ __ ] time

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:30.420
so another fourth dimensions time the

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.490
six dimension is crossing like folding

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.710
the time in to meet alternate timelines

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:37.680
so yeah I just dude I thought I was

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.700
someone in the [ __ ] and I just

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.020
started reading Faust which is all about

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.570
a dude who summons a [ __ ] demon dude

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.640
Faust is [ __ ] littered what's he chat

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.619
about he's just in his library and he's

00:46:46.619 --> 00:46:48.450
like dude I've read every book I'm the

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:50.670
smartest [ __ ] dude and it's just

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.040
nothing's come of it and he like sees

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.320
the Nostradamus book he opens up and

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.640
he's an alchemist he starts looking at

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.710
the alchemy [ __ ] and he was like [ __ ]

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:00.480
dude I need to summon like some sort of

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.830
spirit here just like he's like I'm

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:03.270
ready for the next level and a spirit

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:08.850
comes he's like that's I'm only on the

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:10.440
beginning that's nice people used to

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.480
think like medieval times they thought

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.720
that like the spirit lived in the core

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.040
of the earth and it was just like

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.780
emanating out it was like [ __ ] with

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.000
people and then that like people walked

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.920
around like how bees like suck pollen

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.690
out of flowers they thought that we like

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:27.240
sucked reason and like thoughts out of

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.260
the Sun where we're just kind of like

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.520
buzzing around all day in our little

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.640
orbs and we're like people the medieval

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.310
times were [ __ ] nuts I wasn't built

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:38.460
for medieval times dude I'm don't for

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:44.460
that [ __ ] yeah dude lol gets there like

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.780
no matter what you're on you're like I

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:46.890
should be in [ __ ] it I should be a

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:48.780
medieval warrior dude I just had to

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.130
write a paper for school and like the

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:52.020
guy mentioned feudalism I was like you

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:59.250
[ __ ] up like you [ __ ] up dog

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:01.230
here comes [ __ ] five pages about

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:02.790
feudalism it supposed to be economic

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:04.020
theory and it was like the first three

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.970
to half pages just about feudalism now

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.000
see I [ __ ] love it well that was what

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.109
I was saying in the thing it's like when

00:48:10.109 --> 00:48:11.790
people are like I was talking to city

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:13.290
kid about this the other day how like

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:14.609
people will be like capitalism is

00:48:14.609 --> 00:48:16.590
basically feudalism it's like I could

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.210
see how you could like Tracy elements

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:19.230
over the other but nothing

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.849
compares is like your boss being able to

00:48:20.849 --> 00:48:22.770
cut your [ __ ] head off yeah it's like

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:24.300
is there - they're done two different

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.670
galaxies bro it's like if your boss you

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:30.240
come in your office it's Michael then

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.650
just like steal your [ __ ] farm

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:33.780
there's totally two different [ __ ]

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.000
things mm-hmm so I'd remind this

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.560
[ __ ] about you to let him know

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.579
I don't like those people those people

00:48:38.579 --> 00:48:41.930
forget dude people forget the fact of

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:44.040
capitalism so [ __ ] up was like dude

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.930
spend a week dude in feudalism all it

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:49.140
was was a peasant priest and a warrior

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.849
class those are your options

00:48:50.849 --> 00:48:53.010
yeah that would be you'd be a dark

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:54.690
priest war I'd be a dark crazy I don't

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:57.599
know I worried I'd be probably more of

00:48:57.599 --> 00:48:59.640
like a sage I probably get end up

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.960
getting hung or something I would hang

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.260
you yeah what do you know that why the

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.720
like medieval you know why they're so

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.510
like like [ __ ] up about the land all

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:10.920
it was was them just like you would

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.780
wrote you would ride upon your family

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.070
would ride upon landing back this is our

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:15.780
land and then you'd fight people off and

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:18.089
then you'd have a vassal say like you

00:49:18.089 --> 00:49:19.140
get the Beezer and be like all right

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.970
bees are I'm your Lord you're my vassal

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:22.589
you can control this little stretch of

00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:24.599
my land but see to it that it's tilled

00:49:24.599 --> 00:49:26.310
and then the Beezer would go down to

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:27.869
like someone else and don't lessor do

00:49:27.869 --> 00:49:30.030
can be like tend to this land and then

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:31.589
he it was a good chain people collected

00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:33.810
awful yeah but the all they had back

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:35.400
then was the land because they are

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.050
isolationist because the Muslims were

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:39.000
blocking the Mediterranean so they had

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.109
to go inward and all they could do was

00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:41.579
grow crops and fight each other then

00:49:41.579 --> 00:49:43.109
once they the Crusades took out the

00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:44.819
Muslims they expand and that's where

00:49:44.819 --> 00:49:46.140
capitalism came because we needed all

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:47.880
these different roles Pro [ __ ]

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.339

finale will be him boning the sister and

00:53:47.489 --> 00:53:49.079
it's gonna realize his mom takes him

00:53:49.079 --> 00:53:50.339
under the water it's like that girl's

00:53:50.339 --> 00:53:51.660
not your sister and he just [ __ ]

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.789
loses his boner that's my [ __ ] finale

00:54:03.779 --> 00:54:06.299
bland it came out they bone yeah and I

00:54:06.299 --> 00:54:08.369
was pretty stoked on it I was watching a

00:54:08.369 --> 00:54:11.579
sailor he was I mean it the whole story

00:54:11.579 --> 00:54:13.739
is the backstory is like it was about

00:54:13.739 --> 00:54:15.539
like the illegal slave trade when like

00:54:15.539 --> 00:54:17.369
people would say slave ships so like no

00:54:17.369 --> 00:54:19.259
one knew like when he was supposed to be

00:54:19.259 --> 00:54:21.869
dead or what he was in Africa but he was

00:54:21.869 --> 00:54:23.309
four he was sailing for a company and

00:54:23.309 --> 00:54:24.569
the whole thing was basically that like

00:54:24.569 --> 00:54:26.729
this you know that the Honorable East

00:54:26.729 --> 00:54:27.239
England

00:54:27.239 --> 00:54:29.609
East I would go to the East Indian

00:54:29.609 --> 00:54:32.369
trading company yeah they um sorry I

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:34.950
should be on the air they were like

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:36.569
securely they sent him to do missions

00:54:36.569 --> 00:54:37.680
and he didn't that's what I'm guessing

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.969
is he didn't know and they're like yo

00:54:38.969 --> 00:54:40.049
you gotta take these slaves back he's

00:54:40.049 --> 00:54:41.759
like I'm not about us [ __ ] against

00:54:41.759 --> 00:54:43.829
the sailors code but somewhere along the

00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:45.420
line he inhabits he gets these like

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:48.719
shamanic powers yeah Dooney like you see

00:54:48.719 --> 00:54:50.009
when he channels his sister while she's

00:54:50.009 --> 00:54:50.599

00:54:50.599 --> 00:54:55.319

01:08:54.359 --> 01:08:58.049

01:08:58.049 --> 01:08:59.870
