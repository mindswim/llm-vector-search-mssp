got you know maybe I will have some

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.040
anxiety from that last cast starting to

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.509
set in a little trying to remember

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.519
exactly Louis said we kind of kicked up

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.990
a lot of trash we might get a mantra we

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.730
were in the halo zone dude just picking

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.130
up nuggets what's this what do you think

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.600
this thing is I don't know it's bring it

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.170
to the surface

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.930
oh it's radioactive it destroyed our

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.279
careers again yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] I

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.969
don't know I don't think we said

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.980
anything that crazy do you say anything

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.780
crazy it's just like I said I dislike

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.120
getting taken that's that's that's

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.190
another thing that really sucks is like

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.030
if you even touch these topics yeah it's

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.710
like looking to say whatever they want

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.680
he said this [ __ ] asshole's yeah yeah

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.239
so that's you know that's a tough one

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.980
that's a bummer I mean dude honestly

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
though it's like I don't know I've

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.010
gotten past the point of being thinking

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.870
I'm right about all this stuff it's yeah

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.520
here's just what I think here's what I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.530
see and here's like there's some [ __ ]

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.570
spins around in my brain and this is

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.130
what I'm thinking yeah

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.479
if someone buddy no actually here's

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.159

culture has been appropriated for sure I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.770
can hear I can hear from other comics on

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.280

it's easy I mean that's I just as a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.470
point of appropriate like that's it's

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.909
not like they were original when they

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.320

write a paper about how my how my

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.240
identity plays in when I do therapy with

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.830
people like how I acknowledge my racial

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.510
differences with people I work with and

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.440
I've been saying this since I've been

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.810
there I'm like just I just get to know

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.390
people as individuals yeah and then if

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.160
the subject of race comes up which it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.200
does sometimes organically we talk about

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.150
it that's that's my stance on that I'm

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.860
not gonna they they would have you go in

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.380

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.580
what's going on like all I'm stressed

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.140
about this and it's like how does it

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.550
feel the fact that I'm white and you're

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.310
black like bay or ask some variant of

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.540
that question be like well how does our

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.320
black person that they're gonna be like

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.420
what the [ __ ] them now I don't the [ __ ]

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.610
weird exact that's what I've been saying

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.290
from the beginning dude I've been made

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.520
to feel like I'm an [ __ ] for being

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.840
like don't do I've been telling my

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.070
student rights man like please don't

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.540
that's the weirdest [ __ ] thing you

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.340
can do yeah people come in and they're

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.410
like problems their parents this and

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.000
that like dude all kinds of [ __ ] on let

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.310
me stop you there have you recognized

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.990
how powerful I am because of my

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.780
whiteness exactly would I say that

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.570
exactly dude so I'm I read my thing was

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.620
I had to do a thing that was like me

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.940
recognizing that and me dealing with my

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.650
identity and how I'm like

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.290
conceptualizing that my work dude you

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.670
know Makowski spun that I spun the

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.220
bottle bro I was basically like I reject

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.500
this whole way of thinking and it's like

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.900
I have a theory that the people who are

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.190
proposing these kind of theories are

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.720
doing it because they secretly feel

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.250
uncomfortable around minorities and they

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.660
use that for their own benefit has

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.970
nothing to do with yeah it's for their

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.070
own purpose like I've never I have

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.450
decent instincts dude and there's never

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.680
been a point where I bit like I had

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.020
people say stuff you know there's about

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.400
like white people this or that and like

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.510
we'll talk and laugh about it but

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.370
there's no need to be like are you

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.840
threatened by my power and just let you

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.580
know I will use my power and you're it's

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.500
like there was one thing it's like how

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.190
do you they're like how do you

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.900
how do you address the role of power

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.750
that's like you just don't exert power

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.240
over it's like simple as that you're not

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.670
just like I demand you come in here now

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.160
it's like what the [ __ ] I just go get

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.510
kids and I'm like hey what are you in

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.830
gym class like yeah I'm like you want to

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.210
stay in gym class for like could I on my

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.860
camera I'll catch you next Tuesday it's

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.630
all you gotta do not be like I are the

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.640
power invested in me by this school and

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.500
the school I'm at you must come with me

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.180
now yeah nobody [ __ ] what the [ __ ] you

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.400
talking dude all the comments like you

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.230
don't think you had power oh and it's

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.510
like not really dude I mean if you're

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.790
gonna say like I have more money sure

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.340
it's like what kind of Star Wars [ __ ]

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.290
are these people walking around on so I

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.120
submitted a paper basically saying like

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.370
their version of big and winning is the

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.660
distance they can place between

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.860
themselves and like the hetero

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.340
patriarchy structure if you can like the

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.200
whole point of the interaction comes to

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.760
like their version of like killing it is

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.070
to like places much distance from like

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.320
quote unquote whiteness and like hetero

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.840
patriarchy and then if all you do is you

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.100
go around and blast that out to

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.780
everybody it's like this weird like it's

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.700
like it's like a chauvinism but like a

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.820
perverted weird distorted form of it and

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.260
you know if you're like I'm a [ __ ]

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.580
big-ass dick I [ __ ] so hard it's like

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.850
I'm so pure and non-white and aware of

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.840
my and it's like that's you're just

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.400
you're working with people who or

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.960
literally could give a [ __ ] about this

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.260
sorry so now it's it's it's ties into

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.790
all the [ __ ] [ __ ] ties into all this

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.380
[ __ ] you're saying so it's like [ __ ] you

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.610
have these people doing this [ __ ] and

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.960
they're like hyping each other up and

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.360

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.040
coming from the main line to where like

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.060

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.280
with black people yeah so they're like

got dude I got slammed on this but that

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.620
was my whole theory is like all you have

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.170
to do is just it was it was basically

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.970
like I mean look go ahead while we're on

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.870
this it's like dude imagine so my team I

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.460
was on the tip of [ __ ] like Remember

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.180
the Titans those movies yeah have just

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.730
there's been that's a genre now yeah

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.430
it's kind of whites aviary but it's also

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.940
like complete black victimhood where

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.410
they need to overcome the odds the

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.230
entire time and then there's just still

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.150
every single [ __ ] movie is black

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.040
victimhood yeah and they don't like it

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.540
black people don't like it

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.600
who are these slave movies for yeah how

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.980
many times are we gonna make a [ __ ]

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.980
slave movie where we're the total you

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.800
hapless [ __ ] us getting but [ __ ] yeah

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.540
just non set it's just for white people

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.930
yeah it is really big time normal people

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.310
get uncomfortable by it's like I have a

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.890
[ __ ] can we stop with this right now

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.040
can we cut it out we you know or just or

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.870
just make a regular black movie regular

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.640
does it have to be this does it have to

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.290
be that so I could see that if you're

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.700
making a black movie destra it either

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.310
has to be the [ __ ] hood or slavery

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.370
yeah what are we doing I thought I was

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.710
doing if you make a regular sitcom the

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.480
entire sitcom has to be based around

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.300
being black

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.240
exactly it's crazy yeah like he goes

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.220
like I don't know I don't I don't really

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.510
watch like the Cosby's or anything I

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.400
think it was they they're like Family

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.500
Matters I watched it was never about

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.990
that circle it's just people living yeah

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.330
now if you make a sitcom of a round a

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.480
diverse family the entire show is about

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.900
their experience as that race which is

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.420
weird for sure which is weird

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.490
yeah it is and I wonder too if it's like

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.460
just weird white people doing this I

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.550
would assume was I was talking to a kid

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.690
who Stevie was telling me how he loves

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.460
movies and he did say something like

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.250
that like it's gotta be just like a

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.230
regular movie it's not like boys in the

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.580
hood it's not this it's just a movie

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.130
starring life easy there Amistad or boys

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:35.640
in the hood

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.530
there's no [ __ ] medium like it just a

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.120
movie about black people being just

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.340
doing regular [ __ ] like they're black

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.780
and then they're doing this it's not

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.820
like this central theme of the movie is

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.620
just like we're black we're black black

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.030
black black cause you know we're black

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.220
and it's like he'll be kind of [ __ ]

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.740
annoying yeah especially when like we're

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.670
talking about movies and you're talking

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.260
like sick movies he's seen he's like

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.120
yeah it's like most of sick movies are

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.180
all white casts because it's about a

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.590
plot exactly yeah

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.480
there's no that's not just like look at

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.000
this racial disparity that you know yeah

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.520
they'd it's it's really you know how it

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.530
ends every single time to make movies

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.470
there's no like wild surprise there yeah

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.760
it's gonna be hey you know that white

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.130
guy that was kind of a protagonist to

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.200
the beginning or an antagonist the very

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.580
end is you make you mutt brother this

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.280
whole time fine and then the black out

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.690
be like finally you've seen the light

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.210
that we'd we know inherently we know

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.130
good inherently we're trying to instill

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.500
it in you white man it's like I see it

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.350
now I love do the whole yeah yeah dude

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.200
it's pretty tired John Ramin that has to

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.670
be incredible if you don't know if they

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.560
keep coming up and again they do well

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.180
yeah because of white people white

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.490
people go to the movies to see that [ __ ]

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.980
kind of like masochistic it is it's

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.430
weird

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.810
yeah I saw 1917 what's that let's go hos

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.570
1917 it's a World War one movie let's go

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.650
huh

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.140
finally dude world war once finally

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.640
getting this shine it deserves the last

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.680
call years yeah again the shine it

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.449
it has been that's one world one is the

00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:06.209
[ __ ] ww1 is but I don't know what one is

00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:08.699
the worst [ __ ] [ __ ] in the world

00:11:08.699 --> 00:11:10.470
remember we saw the movie in theatres

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.050
the 3d yeah that rattled me up a little

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.910
bit dude and that was nothing they

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.730
didn't get into like the real harshness

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:22.439
of like in in 1917 they it's awesome you

00:11:22.439 --> 00:11:25.769
got to see it it's a dude who's there in

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:29.279
one trench the Germans have retreated

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:31.589
mm-hmm they've left their trenches and

00:11:31.589 --> 00:11:34.079
the British think they have them on the

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.819
run and like we got to pursue them and

00:11:35.819 --> 00:11:37.949
then this general is like no it's a trap

00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:39.990
they want you to pursue them so these

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.540
two these two soldiers have to race up

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.279
to the front line of the British

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:46.889
soldiers to be like don't charge it's a

00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:49.499
trap and his brother is one of the

00:11:49.499 --> 00:11:51.119
soldiers that's in that so that's why

00:11:51.119 --> 00:11:52.050
they sent him there like you're gonna

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.819
you're gonna work hard to get there damn

00:11:53.819 --> 00:11:56.160
and like they have to like they cross no

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.019
man's land in the beginning which was

00:11:58.019 --> 00:11:59.309
you know the area between the two

00:11:59.309 --> 00:12:01.709
trenches that was just bombed out just

00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:04.769
filled with corpses the grossest [ __ ] in

00:12:04.769 --> 00:12:07.230
the world I mean like there's that was

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.120
like total war they were reducing hole

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.920
yeah me now he just do that elsewhere

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.759
but well it was weird like total war

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:16.259
definitely the definition of like total

00:12:16.259 --> 00:12:18.449
war is like your entire country's

00:12:18.449 --> 00:12:20.519
economy and resources devoted to the war

00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:22.319
okay yes World War one was definitely a

00:12:22.319 --> 00:12:23.519
total war but they weren't like hitting

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:25.350
civilian cities as much gotcha it was

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:29.579
basically just to frontlines okay but

00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:31.559
like just crossing no-man's land is like

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:33.269
the scariest thing in the [ __ ] world

00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:35.699
Oh seeing it all in like when they go

00:12:35.699 --> 00:12:37.259
between the trenches and [ __ ] yeah just

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:39.540
filled with [ __ ] corpses and like oh

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.160
because they fought in the same spots

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.970
for years they didn't move I just sat

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.290
there killing each other in the same

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.990
spot dude that's that's the same that's

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.249
what I was when I was talking about the

00:12:50.249 --> 00:12:52.499
guy the Explorer who saw all this things

00:12:52.499 --> 00:12:54.420
eating each other he came to a field of

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.860
skeletons and he was like this must have

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.720
been like a war zone and it was just

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.220
there were Turtles coming and they took

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.420
that [ __ ] wolves would eat the

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.459
Turtles the [ __ ] tiger Zi then they

00:13:02.459 --> 00:13:03.600
all just would die there's a ton of

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.449
skeleton that must've been crazy I mean

00:13:06.449 --> 00:13:08.730
seeing like if I go to a funeral and I

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.009
controlled sinning I'm kind of like dude

00:13:11.009 --> 00:13:15.050
there's a guy named his name's Otto Dix

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.510
it's some of the wildest [ __ ] artwork

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.279
cuz he was he was a German guy in World

00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:21.050
War one and he like you know they're

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.000
they're all like incredibly [ __ ] up

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.800
yeah you know shell-shocked and all that

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.850
year psychology guy

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.680
of course Otto Dix's World War one

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.980
artwork is [ __ ] wild bro do you need

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.529
to Pete that might be the right dark

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:36.350
[ __ ] up [ __ ] that some guys clearly

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:40.130
went through hell oh man dude yeah it's

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.720
very spooky peeping it's tough right now

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.180
super spooky yeah I mean must have been

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.640
the saddest time I mean again I thought

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.630
really because that was like the

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:48.890
majority of history forever

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.410
ya know this was this was a different

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.000
level you think so horrible one was a

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.980
different level who's a ha it was the

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.220
first like modern Swami yeah that's true

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.589
or what war was never like that true I

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:01.640
mean if you're especially if everyone

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.410
just has swords like couple you'll get

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.170
stabbed yeah you guys win [ __ ] it's like

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.580
a big fight this was you just sit there

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.830
and get shelled back and forth the whole

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.870
time you're just waiting and there's no

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.310
rhyme or reason you're just waiting for

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.899
a shell to land on you for two years

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:17.630
you're sitting there just like well

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.690
death is coming shortly yes I guess that

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:21.920
is different cuz when you're fighting

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.240
with swords and [ __ ] like you're pretty

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.560
you know you're in the driver somebody

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.000
hit you from behind but the most part

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.470
like you're know what you're doing if

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.880
there's just like a huge weapon that my

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.470
fault is sky at any moment that's like

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.820
that is a different thing yeah it's just

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.380
this impending day and then there's gas

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.270
attacks where just a chemical comes and

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.610
you all choke Jesus you all [ __ ] and

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.380
then like do you ever get into the

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.450
economics of all the wars like the money

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.339
behind it and stuff I roll over one a

00:14:43.339 --> 00:14:45.709
little bit that's where we became well

00:14:45.709 --> 00:14:47.570
like the number one or like the reason

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.190
that being the reason for certain Wars

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.100
there's a guy every every war yeah

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.260
exactly spuds spud was painting for a

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.110
guy he's a historian at before you World

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.260
War one was literally for no reason at

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.550
the end of the war they had to start

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.020
like the countries that were about to

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.680
win were like oh [ __ ] we didn't uh we

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.060
got to come up with something that we

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.670
won or everyone's gonna cut our [ __ ]

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.950
heads off once everybody finds out when

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.510
we signed these treaties and nothing

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.190
changed everyone's gonna be like what

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.140
the [ __ ] was that no one knew what it

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.550
was about the World War one was about

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.980
nothing hey what the [ __ ] the world war

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.390
one was literally about nothing

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.070
people were just hype they got height

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.449
they were like we got all these cool new

00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:28.850
weapons is gonna be [ __ ] wild Horace

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.860
fun didn't we Stroh man nice from that

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.040
we did because we weren't involved oh

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.630
okay we started some we sent the boys

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.430
over there late do you think we had a

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.009
little bit of maneuvering in the unrest

00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:44.720
department I mean yeah probably yeah I

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.569
think everyone did that thing got fired

00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:49.639
up quick well so yeah I also one or two

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:51.050
with like the CIA because there's like

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.610
you know Cuba has Iran every country has

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.750
their own spies I wonder how much

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.339
friction gets generated from people

00:15:55.339 --> 00:15:57.230
being like go see what everyone else is

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.790
up to and then everyone's a spine what

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.910
the [ __ ] you spying on us for it's just

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.519
like they've escalated us they've been

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:06.290
escalated yeah they were spying on us

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.259
yeah definitely it's pretty fun also

00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:12.139
there's no reason for this yeah most

00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:14.930
wars and [ __ ] yeah non-stop world war

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.060
once [ __ ] up war one is totally [ __ ]

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.680
up at least World War 2 was like the

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.230
Germans and the Japanese and [ __ ]

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.079
fired up yeah they were one there were

00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:26.540
some ideology behind it war one it was

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.899
just like no ideology that's kind of

00:16:29.899 --> 00:16:31.899
it's even scarier yeah

00:16:31.899 --> 00:16:33.860
towards the end there's some really cool

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.540
moments of like people being like like

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.130
soldiers in different trenches being

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.259
like [ __ ] this hey everyone over there

00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:41.959
like you're our brothers yeah we all got

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.459
beef with you guys this is crazy that

00:16:43.459 --> 00:16:45.350
we're out here this is like socks yeah

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.990
and and it was a royalty that was doing

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.490
it of course and they were all the same

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.370
family oh really like the same family

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.680
they were like cousins fighting

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.970
I always said I feel like wars are

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.769
arguments between billionaires I mean

00:16:57.769 --> 00:16:58.759
that's what they are it's just and

00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:00.649
that's what it back then was like Oh

00:17:00.649 --> 00:17:04.100
cousin you know yeah now fee Alfie's

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.020
started another war we'll send over the

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.630
troops dude that's so evil - like you're

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.220
fighting with your billionaire cousin

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.659
you're like you're telling me I can't

00:17:11.659 --> 00:17:14.870
have Lithuania okay not even not even

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:19.189
land that big it was over nothing I used

00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:20.360
you just then you just start writing

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.250
articles you're like well we can't we

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.120
gotta stop them

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.270
yeah you know these are evil people we

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.159
have to kill and then when the war ends

00:17:28.159 --> 00:17:32.929
you're like well I guess we got like a

00:17:32.929 --> 00:17:37.250
colony out of this yeah [ __ ] wild I

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.350
know it literally the worst human

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.870
suffering like

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.309
those those soldiers that were in that

00:17:42.309 --> 00:17:44.169
and they were all like [ __ ] 17 years

00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:48.070
old just in [ __ ] yeah I think that's cuz

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.659
I used to pretty much you were able to

00:17:49.659 --> 00:17:50.950
do that for if you're a rich family

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.450
you're able to rile up the troops and

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.009
like just send people in and kill each

00:17:54.009 --> 00:17:55.360
other and I think that was when it

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.870
started the technology and the scale got

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.490
so big where people were like what

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:00.999
though

00:18:00.999 --> 00:18:03.639
yeah well cuz it used to be like you

00:18:03.639 --> 00:18:05.590
would have like a private army but

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.999
different like if you were like a rich

00:18:06.999 --> 00:18:09.509
guy you would have like so 50 Knights

00:18:09.509 --> 00:18:12.039
pretty tiny be like I go take that guy's

00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:13.990
[ __ ] land we're gonna that's ours now

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.059
he's not paying me the taxes he owes me

00:18:16.059 --> 00:18:18.429
yeah that was a war that was a fight now

00:18:18.429 --> 00:18:19.960
and then in World War one it's like a

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.960
million people along a [ __ ] mud

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.200
trench throwing chemicals at each other

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.960
someone's funding it dude all the tax

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:34.840
payers yeah I mean obviously I said

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.009
they're just like yo let me get that

00:18:36.009 --> 00:18:37.419
eighty cents off the end of your check

00:18:37.419 --> 00:18:40.059
yeah that I mean that led to us in the

00:18:40.059 --> 00:18:42.519
United States getting [ __ ] paper

00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:43.990
table dude really

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.970
Rober won world war ii got us [ __ ]

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.419
bread bro yeah also too when that

00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:51.639
happens you're like time for another one

00:18:51.639 --> 00:18:53.350
how long it's been a while one of those

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.850
in the mix yeah cuz I think you think

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:58.539
about that just blows my mind how it's

00:18:58.539 --> 00:18:59.799
like because well there's two things

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:02.440
those apparently there's a most of the

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.970
world is starving right

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.759
oh no not most I would say about I think

00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:10.029
a good half at 40% as sick is like

00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:11.889
generous as possible I think it's about

00:19:11.889 --> 00:19:14.980
50/50 it's like I think like a third of

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.690
its in like absolute just drastic

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:17.980
poverty and then there's like another

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.600
bit that's in like you know real foot to

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.820
mouth kind of topic by the way I forgot

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.769
go ahead sorry so it's like that's the

00:19:23.769 --> 00:19:24.970
thing too it's never mind me why can't

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.590
we just get along but it's like dude

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.899
there's mother for the half the people

00:19:28.899 --> 00:19:31.830
are like dying you don't get feed them

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.480
instantly I would think so we could feed

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.399
them today I would think so that's the

00:19:36.399 --> 00:19:38.139
question it's like well no again there

00:19:38.139 --> 00:19:39.639
go somebody's go to war with Iran it's

00:19:39.639 --> 00:19:42.429
like I bet [ __ ] why bet in one year

00:19:42.429 --> 00:19:44.259
the United States throws out enough food

00:19:44.259 --> 00:19:46.779
to feed the world I would say without a

00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:49.690
doubt well no but if you're no no no way

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.789
if there's 250 million people the United

00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:53.289
States the starving

00:19:53.289 --> 00:19:54.580
billions oh the dead

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.500
Lisa what of this yeah the other

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.330
countries continue to prove produce food

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.370
at the same yeah if we invaded countries

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.320
with like farmers and [ __ ] we could for

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.539
sure hundred preside oh no no no no but

00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:06.250
the United States alone like everybody

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:07.750
else continues to produce food at the

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.340
exact same rate they're doing but right

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.250
now we just kept our leftovers sure the

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.409
amount of food we waste in the United

00:20:14.409 --> 00:20:16.149
States like [ __ ] that never even sees a

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:17.080
plate

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.870
yeah piles of food that just is is like

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.880
oh [ __ ] no one bought this true get rid

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.210
of it

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.130
throw it out I would I bet that [ __ ]

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.320
well the numbers fall off cuz it's 250

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.809
or feeding 250 they left over the 250

00:20:28.809 --> 00:20:32.740
million and then a 350 350 billion dude

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.659
the people who are there's like billions

00:20:34.659 --> 00:20:38.200
dude tens of billions I hear you but to

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.539
feed to feed someone who's starving it

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:42.700
doesn't take much that's also true it

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.350
doesn't take a lot of F that's true

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.870
amount yeah yeah no that no that's not

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.460
remember those cardboard boxes you got

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.039
from UNICEF as a kid yeah just a [ __ ]

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:52.659
nickel dude we could feed a village

00:20:52.659 --> 00:20:55.149
yes let's give him 80 pounds of rice for

00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:56.559
a quarter you see these guys well that

00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:58.840
is true dude if you're hitting BJ's if

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.130
you gave them if you give a third wall

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.080
to BJ's member just a pallet of gushers

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.789
I mean dude there was a sack of rice I

00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:05.620
had that like I bought I was like I got

00:21:17.889 --> 00:21:18.700
responsibility

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.559
that's true but that's the attitude that

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:22.480
got us here met god damn it dude

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.889

00:21:23.889 --> 00:21:26.559
whole war of this kind of like like the

00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:27.789
[ __ ] we were just watching like yeah

00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:31.809
saamne it's like just an immature move

00:21:31.809 --> 00:21:33.370
towards what people are I think we've

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.730
been groping our way towards the podcast

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.019
I think it's a for fun I'm not gonna

00:21:38.019 --> 00:21:39.970
[ __ ] podcast is the tip of the spear

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.889
when it comes to world peace I'm pretty

00:21:41.889 --> 00:21:44.320
sure it is dude it is it's the tip of

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.850
the spear of people being like the first

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.620
step everyone has to be like here's what

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.260
I'm thinking and be like no no that's a

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.169
dumb idea no no that's a bad idea and be

00:21:53.169 --> 00:21:54.940
like okay cool not to see why it's bad

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.940
not like jewelry saying that because I'm

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.730
a woman and you're a man now get rid of

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.730
the power dynamics try to focus on the

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.159
right decision do that with my paper in

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:08.020
a nutshell is basically like I get all

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.380
the stuff

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.520
you guys are doing is coming from a good

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.020
place but you're completely leaving out

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.820
the facts that as humans we have a

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.440
tendency to build hierarchies are on

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.150
everything we can and if you're gonna

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.120
throw this whole like you know racial

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.010
power stuff out there all we're gonna

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.110
really do on a realistic level is build

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.610
hirer he's around that be like I'm the

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.940
most racially aware and you're the worst

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.770
so whatever but yeah so you're the tip

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:30.850
of the spear dude we're breaking

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.730
breaking down hierarchies do you wanna

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.210
fight me you want to fight with us Oh

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:37.630

psychobos stop comedians are signing of

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.390
course we need them obviously we need

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.540
politicians for now you know the future

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.400
til the proletariat you know till we

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.380

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.930

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.110
dude I wanted I oughta mate with the

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.940
robots where you just constant like you

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.500
want me to be legal and you vote yes and

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.240
I feel vote no weeds illegal again yeah

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.460
get back on that I can see the anonymous

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.100
voting is very dangerous

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.750
what do you mean on cellphones and stuff

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.150
yeah because it's gonna result in full

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.070
should we [ __ ] nuke Iran today it's

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.370
like yeah I've voted yeah dude I thought

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.050
it was funny I will be curious to do a

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.510
pilot to see what they could pilot study

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.860
that and be like let's see what numbers

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.450
were getting I don't think they'll ever

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.070
release it because you have so many

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.870
people being like [ __ ] no don't do

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.560
that yeah I think every yeah there's a

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.260
very small amount I'd be like [ __ ] and

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.180
it's like they're all so what are

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.800
they're getting spoon-fed information

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.840
from the media so it's like even if the

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.730
people like Joe I saw it all last night

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.860
they have their in green vision sending

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.750
[ __ ] Rockets up somewhere in the sky

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.640
yeah got a nuke them yeah

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.500
yeah dude yeah it's what you're

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.050
presented and it's couldn't be clearer

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:03.610
but then again you got it you do have to

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.960
remember a lot of people have done is

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.210
[ __ ] doing a lot of people are very very

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.060
damaged Ori and when they get spoon-fed

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.480
this they're in yeah you know yeah

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.090
they're totally in there like I mean

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.730
imagine have it not having the

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.620
wherewithal until you live in let's say

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.630
you live in New York City mm-hmm to be

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.450
like all of us are liberal all of us

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.850
have the same political ideology yeah

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:30.580
isn't this weird to you guys that

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.550
[ __ ] nine million of us are like yes

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.310
yeah this is how it's done anybody that

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.950
disagrees is a [ __ ] [ __ ] yep then

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.150
you go out to you know

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.430
Mechanicsburg and it's like no Trump's

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.200
actually a good business man who knows

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.430
what he's doing and if you disagree

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.380
you're [ __ ] gay yes

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.290
it's wild that's do that's the argument

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:51.580
I'd have people in school they'll be

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.650
like so I don't you don't you ever take

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:55.330
a step back to be like wait mayor how

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.880
are we all getting the same answer to

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.130
this yeah or the fact that may even if

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.570
so like when I'm when they're all be

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:02.980
sitting there people will argue in class

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.410
and then like you know like a black lady

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:06.880
will raise their hand and talk about

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.780
something like you under do you don't

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.040
understand this is how it is and

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.860
everyone be like to see it's like okay

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.510
even if you go home and find 50 other

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.520
people who are gonna back you up I'll go

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.620
to the dustbowl town with 50 [ __ ]

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.150
people are gonna say the opposite you

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.470
guys both think you're right

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:21.550
you both think you're totally right

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.050
you're having the exact same

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.780
conversations about one another yes yeah

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.190
at the dinner table like can you believe

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.530

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.600
I know across town can you believe what

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.460

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:34.900
they're gonna party this is gonna kill

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:35.650

nomenclature yeah it's totally

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.650
acceptable to call them ladyboys yeah

it's like these are this is a

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.990
third-world country because they think

homosexual to not be attracted by them I

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.250
suppose it's like they try to justify it

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.010

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.540

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.010
across and he goes to seeing what a

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:52.060
[ __ ] looked like when they were

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.030

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.330

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:02.980
dude

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.900
st. Thomas Aquinas was there to [ __ ]

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.760
yank my whole you off he's the patron

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:11.110
saint of bad searches on porn oh yeah

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.059
man a coin he was there for me I prayed

00:31:13.059 --> 00:31:14.770
as hard as I could I said Saint Thomas

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.390
helped me out I almost searched ladyboys

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:18.309
on pornhub help me say Tom dude I'm

00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:19.929
telling you I think there's a there's an

00:31:19.929 --> 00:31:22.809
epidemic amongst heterosexual dudes I

00:31:22.809 --> 00:31:24.669
think there's a lot of dudes perusing

00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:26.410
lady boys that are not talking about it

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.660
I'm not just projecting I think it's

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.960
going on I only perused lady boys well

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.150
they weren't lady boys I just peruse

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:39.600
just trans people fight a trans guy

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:48.520
proper word proper I only proves T porn

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.990
once after you brought it up it's how

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.940
good it was yes [ __ ] gross I watched

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.290
some dude with like an Adam's apple and

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:56.020
a clavicle well there's so many

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.820
gradients of it where there's like and

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.710
it's a really weird thing to get into

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:00.669
because like you're saying you'll just

00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:01.900
there'll be one where you're like you'll

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.510
see with the terms called passable yes

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.640
you'll see like a passable where you're

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.590
like that looks like a hot chick yeah

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.660
and then it's like so you create the

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.030
illusion also you're a click away from a

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.850
just a regular hot chick so there's

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.610
something there that real one oh yeah no

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.350
there's a little dark little fun there

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.720
it's a forbidden fruit bro and then you

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.910
need to watch this you will look every

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.890
space it's the funniest thing loads are

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.660
so fun there's one dude that's just

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.540
jacked as [ __ ] he's this British guy he

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.250
runs a bar down there with his lady boys

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.230
like what what do you undo yeah he says

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.910
they're [ __ ] hot dude what's your

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:40.030
problem I mean sick I love the fact that

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.000
that's happening but I'm saying it's

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.710
just not a good porn hole to get into

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:46.330
because it's a black hole but if you

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:47.620
actually want to go to Thailand and

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.049
become a [ __ ] baller yeah I respect

00:32:50.049 --> 00:32:52.419
that for sure if it's so funny to go

00:32:52.419 --> 00:32:54.010
from a world of definitely not getting

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.620
any sniz yet these guys were must have

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.770
been innocence trust me these guys are

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.200
their dorks yeah and then they just

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.750
moved like the the boy is so his this

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.419
guy's hadn't seen his dad in like three

00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:09.429
years okay and then he goes to Thailand

00:33:09.429 --> 00:33:11.530

come to terms with my dad perhaps he's a

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:29.100
bit of a homosexual what is it's a it's

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.230
a total puzzle because there's quite the

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.320
conundrum there is somewhere out there

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.510

well that's the thing is though is

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.190
stunning it's an illusion as soon as

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:48.690
it's shattered by like like you said an

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:51.240

no no that's the funny thing do that so

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.069
that people are trying to figure out is

00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:48.420
that gay or not and that's where it

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.550
breaks down I've said this on a live

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.510
cast long ago that's the breakdown of

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.040
people camping into sexual camps it's

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.310
just kind of like all right yes I don't

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.569

00:38:00.569 --> 00:38:02.520
whatever you want yes [ __ ] telling you

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.060

there true or you're just like now do

00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:12.900
this gang what the [ __ ] true I think it

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.190
ends there the straightest thing you can

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:16.890
do is be celibate that's what I'm dude

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:18.690
the more straight you the the [ __ ]

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.099
most righteous you can be is to be

00:38:20.099 --> 00:38:22.770
chaste celibate Jesus Christ I turned

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.119
down sinners last night I said god bless

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:26.910

00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:36.000
thank you you are sued Schopenhauer's

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.770
last step is to become the aesthetic

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:40.260
where he basically said first step is

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.819
don't come at all you have to cut off

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:44.220
all sexual stuff then you eventually

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.680
become like you start going the next

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.170
level but even said he goes the only

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.490
thing is you do that you go oh yeah

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:53.910
there's just nothing okay cool oh great

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:56.760
I didn't come you have in common hell

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.619
better but to come is to enter back in

00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:00.240
there back into the tangle of the will

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.920
which is there's nothing but pain

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.119
there's no escaping long will man

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:04.589
there's no excuse me anything there's no

00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:06.630
escaping the will you can if you're in

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.369
ascetic but you just you can't you just

00:39:08.369 --> 00:39:09.480
lay there and you're just you know

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.800

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.089

myself a high floor sweeping salary on

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:30.119

the same I'd rather do that yeah then

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:41.869
drop that kind of be the face of that I

00:39:41.869 --> 00:39:45.119
dead serious yeah that's that's what the

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:45.810
industry wants

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:48.690
I [ __ ] me as that special the industry

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:51.150
is pushing that I think people just it's

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:52.380
like a religious thing it's just like

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.640
now it's not stand-up it's just people

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.260
are saying your views in a way that's

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:55.530
kind

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.620
of entertaining and you're like yeah

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.440
awesome yeah and not even that one like

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.930
there weren't even jokes now and the one

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:07.280
part was just like it sounded like a bad

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.470
teacher yeah I know that part of like

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.260
the script we've been handed it boring

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.590
yeah you can be one of two things it's

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:18.660
like and she's like Stanley it's like

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.870
someone's not funny and they do like a

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:23.700
outrageous a troll but big Moe true but

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:28.310
it's like okay yeah yeah cool I guess

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:32.160
tell me man look give me the information

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.750
that tells me I'm totally wrong and I'll

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:34.860
lap it up bro

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.360
that's all I've been saying that that

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.160
may give me a problem so these things

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.250
are so objective as to what's funny

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:43.350
what's not funny what's [ __ ] corny I

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:45.810
mean sub subjective excuse me excuse me

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.270
I have a master's pardon me excuse me I

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:49.800
have my master's you mean subjective

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.020
yeah I always never got those right ever

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.300
well if you pay $40,000 you two can get

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.120
subjective and objective right yeah

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.790
that's what it's worth you learned like

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.770
the big Harvard words and you know

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:03.540
though minutes late it's just so comedy

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.900
is just subjective enough that even and

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.310
then you believe there's a right answer

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:10.500
yes you think it's funny so you're like

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.230
it's objectively funny mm-hm and you

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:15.120
know yeah absolutely can never be but

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.470
dude they're doing stand-up being like

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.270
I'm just tapped into this bigger picture

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:19.920
and you're just you're hating it you

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.210

sir did we're living in a Star Wars

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.150
realm of just inflicting conflicting

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.760
projections it's a jungle trouble we're

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.680
Schopenhauer's dude we're just fine

Matt's being a real [ __ ] about these

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.790
songs oh [ __ ] I was thinking about this

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.260
morning how sick that would be if this

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.060
podcast turned into us just becoming

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.340
diametrically opposed and just spending

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.990
our weeks trying to like trap each other

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:30.300
up they meeting up as enemies make hello

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.580

hello again rival I don't that will be

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.020
funny though Matt came in with his brand

them down with the microfiber microfiber

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:51.480
that came with it I was better very

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.140
safely put them into the case I've never

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.330
seen someone take care of anything the

00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:58.950
way Matt just took care of his glasses

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:00.900
