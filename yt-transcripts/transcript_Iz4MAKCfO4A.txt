[Laughter]

things and then beheaded him do we know

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.930
he lured him with candy did the guy say

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.730
to be like it was candy

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.830
they said the audiobook I was listening

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.420
to they said he got lured with candy and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.430
toys I mean they might have looked at

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.930
like mall footage of a guy just like

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.150
with a couple packs footballs like

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.610
alright I guess how old was a kid do you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.920
remember I was like 7 years old that's

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.100
prime candy and a van there no I [ __ ]

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.810
got over the van and cut his [ __ ]

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.410
head off to it mighty yellow this is a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.030
fucked-up theory could have been Alex

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.459
Walsh himself really you might have

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.930
lured his own son if he had a thumb dude

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.610
it might if he had his own son and rose

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.650
to the [ __ ] top do you think if you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.150
have like four sons you can behead one

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.050
of them and get paid

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.730
biblically feel like we got to do

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.590
something about this that's a tale as

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.030
old as time if you get a beheaded son

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.470
you have a book deal instantly

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.390
especially if you can go around and try

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.280
to like hide the head somewhere good I'm

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.310
gonna make my son get into Middle

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.739
Eastern journalism so hopefully one day

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.040
gets his [ __ ] head cut off over there

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.360
dude headless son is a good forward your

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.040
headless son is [ __ ] sick you get

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.209
something where what happened to Mike

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.560
Myers though he had a headless mom

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.410
that's true that turns you [ __ ]

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.700
headless understands you into a ball a

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.380
headless son turns you into a vicious

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.980
[ __ ] entrepreneur I'm gonna take over

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.560
this [ __ ] no we need some prevention

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.480
of headless sons the future that's what

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.579
he did he started like investigating

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.430
like he's basically headless son he was

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.250
true detective in real life his son got

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.540
beheaded and he was like I got

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.340
investigated everything your son getting

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.870
beheaded is so [ __ ] outrageous I was

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.340
hilarious I was listening to an

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.019
audiobook that was like not about that

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.489
at all and I had to pause it in laugh

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.350
for a while I was like holy [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.530
like and his his face a severed head was

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.470
found four days later like yeah that's

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.959
so funny like what do you even say you

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.979
get a daddy like yeah [ __ ] yeah that's

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.979
like I mean you got to be like I don't

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.349
know man if your kid gets like leukemia

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.290
or something there's like

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.210
a mascot will come in and play with them

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.830
for a little before he dies like there's

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.400
cool

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.740
well yet to identify that like there's

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.750
no headless song I think they put it

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.840
like when you have to go identify like a

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.400
cigar box the whole thing in the morgue

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.350
thing and put a blanket though there was

00:04:44.350 --> 00:05:03.280
a body the blanket horrible but it made

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.920
me laugh so hard because I was like okay

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.420
the guys like a they found his severed

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.750
head I was like [ __ ] most about like the

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.130
political climate in the United States

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.080
about like we coddle children so I was

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.750
that guy didn't know that guy that van

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.730
guy did not guys making an argument for

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.440
like how kids eat I'm sure you told him

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.870
first though

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.370
I mean I'm sure he didn't go straight to

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.350
the [ __ ] I beheaded him on the spot

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.900
[Music]

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.860
[Laughter]

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.480
he had to a drag to drug him into the

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.670
woods onto a stump you can't just be

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.830
head so you needed like full it's like

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.330
ringing the bell kid though you can be

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.070
head of kid dude it'd be hard it's [ __ ]

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.020
I just cut like I like cut sweet

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.610
potatoes and a half sometimes you really

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.600
gotta put all your weight on the knife

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.360
severing the spinal cord a full van you

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.740
can get a stump in the back of the van

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.840
nope you got it you can't race over your

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.610
head you don't have you just saw dude oh

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.920
dude you'd only get a clean honorable

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.170
swipe well the kid was probably the hack

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.910
the shadows definitely asleep because of

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.090
how good the dick was true dude

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:31.920
definitely pass out from the dick dude

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.360
yeah that [ __ ] me up man the book is

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.200
funny because they're putting together

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.210
like a good argument for like why we

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.310
that Alex Walsh is also the reason why

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.700
kid

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.620
missing kids were going on milk cart

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.050
milk cartons apparently missing kids are

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.780
like Alex Walsh's Alex Walsh build a

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.840
[ __ ] Empire dude but he [ __ ]

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.120
horrific empire just the worst possible

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.210
spill on the bones the [ __ ] snatched

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.160
up apparently missing kids are like

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.810
their I mean of course they're

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.370
sensationalized cuz it's crazy but like

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.590
missing children are returned to their

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.210
house I think it's like ninety nine

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.360
point seven percent of the time missing

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.200
kids go missing

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.180
and it's usually they ran away they ran

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.010
away or worse comes to worse it's

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.010
usually a loved one a loved one who has

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.570
like take them that's like it's usually

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.490
that that's like the worst case most of

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.790
times inner sex trafficking which is

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.490
that's probably the point seven and uh

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.570
everyone again there's a [ __ ] there's

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.260
a point three percent Lukey Luca Brasi

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.380
dude

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.670
so yeah apparently he was arguing like

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.920
why we shouldn't baby kids so much but

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.210
he's like but to be honest and he told

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.860
this story it was like Jesus [ __ ]

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.870
Christ dude no matter no wonder that

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.610
didn't work out like that ha imagine not

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.870
knowing that and like calling him out

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.540
like yeah dude you're trying to get

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.150
people arrested or [ __ ] snitch like

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.320
what do you have against these criminals

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.760

00:32:09.939 --> 00:32:12.429
the Jesus story everyone knows that well

00:32:12.429 --> 00:32:13.479
a lot of people know this that like

00:32:13.479 --> 00:32:16.119
there was like six or seven and honestly

00:32:16.119 --> 00:32:17.889
like nine mythological figures or have

00:32:17.889 --> 00:32:19.779
like this same story as Jesus born to a

00:32:19.779 --> 00:32:22.599
virgin daughter raised the guy from the

00:32:22.599 --> 00:32:26.399

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:28.929
there's a couple others yeah but the

00:32:28.929 --> 00:32:30.459
whole thing is like born around December

00:32:30.459 --> 00:32:32.829
24th I think it's the winter solstice

00:32:32.829 --> 00:32:34.899
what's the equinox or solstice one of

00:32:34.899 --> 00:32:36.819
the two they're all born around the same

00:32:36.819 --> 00:32:38.829
time yeah and they all in springtime

00:32:38.829 --> 00:32:40.929
so it was like and this was the this was

00:32:40.929 --> 00:32:42.189
Constantine putting this all together

00:32:42.189 --> 00:32:44.619
the Catholic Church and the Council of

00:32:44.619 --> 00:32:46.149
Nicaea famously famously

00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:49.539
but yeah so they're saying that the

00:32:49.539 --> 00:32:51.459
three days like dies for three days

00:32:51.459 --> 00:32:53.859
comes back again right around December

00:32:53.859 --> 00:32:57.279
24th 25th right in that time period the

00:32:57.279 --> 00:32:58.959
Sun if you're watching the Sun it's like

00:32:58.959 --> 00:33:01.089
during the day getting kind of like it

00:33:01.089 --> 00:33:02.469
doesn't go up as high in the sky or

00:33:02.469 --> 00:33:03.669
something okay and if you're out like a

00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:07.149
65 degree latitude the Sun actually

00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:09.039
disappears it's still light out it's not

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:10.209
like Alaska but the Sun actually

00:33:10.209 --> 00:33:11.590
disappears for three days

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:14.590
comes back the third day and it rises

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.240
again and then it starts taking that it

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.000
starts descending up back into the sky

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.930
so they're like going through all this

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:21.580

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.080

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:29.020
guy it was like a Donnie Adonis telltale

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.820
tuck or some [ __ ] in the Hebrew but the

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.290
thing was there was this guy who like

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:34.360
went out into the woods and chopped off

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.000
his dong and his dong lady and the guy

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.560
chopped off his dong and grew into a

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.179
Christmas and grew into a Christmas tree

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:43.350
and his dong fruited the fruits like the

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.370
forbidden fruit grew underneath the

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:46.720
Christmas tree if you know anything

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.149
about Amanita muscaria it loves to grow

00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:51.790
underneath coniferous plants so that's

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.020
where they say the Christmas tree thing

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.360
came from they was like in the wrote the

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.740
Romans did it like the Roman fertility

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.540
cults you would go and you would chop

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.850
down a tree to celebrate that dude who

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:02.590
like chopped off his dong and became a

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.780
Christmas tree Wow so they're saying

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.310
that's why today and that got just

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:07.900
pulled into Catholicism that it was

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.310
based off like whatever think there's

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:13.150
any conifers in that region at all in

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.940
Rome yeah I'm like the Holy Roman Empire

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.280
about the whole thing yeah so apparently

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.140
they were like sacred trees and these

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.730
these are like a bunch of different uh

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.680
which people call it these are now

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.290
there's in Italy somewhere

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:26.880
there's definitely films yeah there's

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.650
some coniferous [ __ ] tree skin yeah

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:31.230
but the but that's the whole point of

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.550
them that's why we bring them into our

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:35.160
house and then what happens on December

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.230
25th a little presents pop up under the

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:42.000
trees Amanita muscaria it dude it just

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.550
is [ __ ] it just is dude no why do we

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.960
bring them in why do we cut out

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.460
Christmas trees I don't know

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.250
it's [ __ ] Roman paganism yeah it's

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.260
Roman paganism based around

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.780
Amanita muscaria okay cuz that's where

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.580
they would grow under those trees okay

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.380
dude it's [ __ ] I'm blowing the

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.030
[ __ ] lid off everything dude yeah I

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.130
don't think it's that like I think it is

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.220
that simple it all came out of no no I

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.630
mean I don't think it's that it's not

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.369
mind-blowing to me that like traditions

00:36:08.369 --> 00:36:11.490
we have now they all stem from forever

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:15.119
yeah but it's [ __ ] took pagan rituals

00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:17.850
we even want to bring people in it will

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:19.710
be like hey you [ __ ] German tribes

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.960
these Germanic tribes like yeah we know

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.270
you worship [ __ ] wreaths and [ __ ]

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:26.180
like that yeah yeah we'll use them to

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.710
worship Christianity through your

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.780
[ __ ] deeper than that that's

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.150
apparently Constantine was a I think he

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.100
was a Sun worshipping pagan and he

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.710
stopped they're saying they're saying he

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:38.760
didn't become a Christian there's and

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.500
he's made it the [ __ ] up he literally

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.300
just took every religion in the area and

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.740
just combine it into one it was like

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.180
this what we're up to you now and then

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.830
apparently like as he got older he was

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.030
like yeah that [ __ ] sucks I went back to

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:50.460
being a Sun worshiper and it just like

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.710
spread and want it crazy and there was

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:53.910
the Dead Sea Scrolls that like

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:54.780
apparently were supposed to get

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.020
translated and there was like there was

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.660
like five or six different priests and

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:01.890
like biblical scholars who were like

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.480
tied into like the Catholic Church and

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.040
there was one renegade who had no charge

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.359
affiliations and they like completely

00:37:06.359 --> 00:37:08.550
squashed his interpretation yeah and

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:12.390
they never put their stuff out I don't

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:13.950
think the Catholic Church would like

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.380
hide this right now like if you're like

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.670
where did this tradition come from they

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.140
do it's not like it's tied to the

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.030
religion it's like having a Christmas

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.590
tree means anything I know how come they

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.760
never told us about it and I want to

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.650
count the school for 12 years yeah back

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:28.080
then it was definitely but apparently

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.430
they said it was our Catholic school

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:31.710
teachers it's not the [ __ ] Vatican

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.119
these are retards that grow up in your

00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:36.510
town but true but my thing is there's

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.040
like inquisitions that went to like

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:38.700
crush

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.050
this kind of knowledge from they didn't

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:45.119
want people to know this so it's an evil

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:47.579
[ __ ] Empire bro I mean it's an empire

00:37:47.579 --> 00:37:50.160
so it's definitely got some evil I mean

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.540
dude they were like burning babies and

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.780
[ __ ] back it was every single Empire is

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.760
our Empire true aren't we burn some

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.740
babes yeah we don't over to Vietnam toss

00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.910
them around a little toss some babes

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.770
around yeah I mean every Empire is gonna

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.589
have a burger trail so that's what like

00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:06.990
the whole like I'm not [ __ ] on you

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:09.869
that's like these like every yeah

00:38:09.869 --> 00:38:11.970
everything comes from basically pagan

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.950
rituals before Christianity it's not

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:15.960
like they invented their own traditions

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.150
yeah but it's like the story of Jesus

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.800
the reason his story was that is because

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.859
if his story matched previous prophecies

00:38:22.859 --> 00:38:25.530
and he lined it up to match those

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:30.210
prophecies but there's like no they just

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.010
took a narrative and said this is the

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.560
truth yeah they totally took a myth and

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.180
then people believe this myth is true

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.730
it's just Jesus it's just as ridiculous

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:40.170
to believe in Jesus as Horus if I was

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:41.310
like not actually I believe in Horus

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:45.180
feel like no it's Jesus you freak it's

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.280
insane yeah but most of these people

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.859
would like what's the difference what's

00:38:49.859 --> 00:38:51.380
it man that's what I'm saying it's crazy

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.609
it's crazy either way it's not even

00:38:53.609 --> 00:38:55.710
what's again like if you went into the

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.000
Vatican we're like look at this they've

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.869
dug yeah I doubt it I if you were like

00:39:00.869 --> 00:39:03.450
this is based off of the ancient

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:05.569
Egyptian thing Horus they'd be like no I

00:39:05.569 --> 00:39:08.190
bet if you know a priest they'd be like

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.069
well that these traditions were written

00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:13.079
down back then when he translated Dead

00:39:13.079 --> 00:39:14.369
Sea Scrolls he was trying to say like

00:39:14.369 --> 00:39:15.720
this and they were like no it's not as

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.400
blasphemy there's no way this is not

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.050
based off anything else that's just like

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.670
they're called blasphemy on the Dead Sea

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.410
so it's kind of like that's [ __ ]

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.060
they're like there's no way this Jesus

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.170
Christ wasn't based on this is like

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.000
Jesus Christ was the only one that's

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.260
like just lies people say about the

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.720
other ones it's like again I think the

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.700
Vatican is filled with a lot of smart

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.190
people that are like they're not gonna

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:39.359
be like nah that's not true now like

00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:43.410
when is it like 1980 maybe dude they

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:45.510
they Bend when they have to now they

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:47.819
have like a course Pope and it's [ __ ]

00:39:47.819 --> 00:39:50.339
[ __ ] I mean I it's the same as any

00:39:50.339 --> 00:39:51.670
religion yeah

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:54.490
sucks yeah but dude it's gonna be some

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:57.910
bad they do a lot of good no you don't

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:00.069
think really think so there's not a lot

00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:02.380
of charity coming out of [ __ ]

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.079
touching boys boys is a big one that's

00:40:05.079 --> 00:40:07.150
bad I don't like I don't trust charities

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:08.740
in general organize charities kind of

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.500
cut me the [ __ ] out dude but I don't

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.299
know I think the I think it's I think

00:40:13.299 --> 00:40:15.250
it's crazy that they don't just like

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.240
alright so here's this whole

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.549
organization here's what we do we like

00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:20.200
we're based off the Roman fertility cult

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.670
somebody came into this and we came into

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.530
that rather like this is the one true

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:29.200
God that's what they do there might be

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.339
something you can talk to something like

00:40:30.339 --> 00:40:32.049
ogee in the vatican it'll take you to

00:40:32.049 --> 00:40:33.849
like the dusty library i mean like well

00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:35.680
yeah yeah i don't even think it's that

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.270
difficult to find like in [ __ ]

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.280
Religulous that documentary he stalks

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.420
them yeah

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:44.020
dome are the stalks is like a Vatican

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.660
astronomer who's just like yeah we

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.920
didn't have science when the Bible was

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.270
written there's nothing factual in that

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.660
book mmm-hmm he works for the Vatican

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:55.690
mmm no yeah I don't know I just think

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.280
the fact that it's based off of all that

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.990
[ __ ] and it's like people are so into it

00:40:58.990 --> 00:40:59.950
it's [ __ ] crazy

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:04.630
yeah I mean what do you mean like what's

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.299
crazy about that they did it was just

00:41:07.299 --> 00:41:09.160
they thought that people don't know

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.670
Jesus wasn't probably born on Christmas

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:13.869
it was a [ __ ] where does this base off

00:41:13.869 --> 00:41:15.520
mythology just weird to me that they

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.559
were just like yep that's the truth yeah

00:41:17.559 --> 00:41:18.970
that's how they got people that were

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:21.420
believing that mythology mmm-hmm to join

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.040
Christianity yeah but it still works now

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.869
like if I were to tell my mom like dude

00:41:25.869 --> 00:41:27.010
you know that [ __ ] was based off horse

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:28.809
where'd you get that from that's

00:41:28.809 --> 00:41:31.690
ridiculous that's the majority of people

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:35.319
in it I don't know I just don't see like

00:41:35.319 --> 00:41:38.230
the what's that matter I think it's

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:41.619
[ __ ] sick to know that yeah that that

00:41:41.619 --> 00:41:45.730
lie has made it that far now yeah that's

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.040
[ __ ] crazy yeah that like the story

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:53.290
of Jesus yeah yeah it's funny it's

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:56.650
[ __ ] wild yeah Bill Maher [ __ ]

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:59.260
crossed it for me but in Religulous he

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.940
explains all that she I hate it Bill

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.200
Maher and Religulous I mean thought it

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.559
saw he was a smart

00:42:03.559 --> 00:42:05.989
kind of is but he did he go into Astro

00:42:05.989 --> 00:42:09.140
theology and all that nobody explained

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.259
Horace and like how it's all based off

00:42:12.259 --> 00:42:15.859
of like mythology yeah because it is it

00:42:15.859 --> 00:42:19.339
is mythology yeah but the the cool thing

00:42:19.339 --> 00:42:20.779
was is how it was actually based off of

00:42:20.779 --> 00:42:22.759
astrological events which mythologies

00:42:22.759 --> 00:42:24.680
can from people studying the Stars and

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.239
making up stories North Star and all

00:42:26.239 --> 00:42:28.160
that [ __ ] three wise men Orient's belt

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.949
yeah all that stuff Orion Orion dude

00:42:33.489 --> 00:42:35.839
Orion but yeah I do think that that

00:42:35.839 --> 00:42:40.519
shit's crazy to me how it's like the

00:42:40.519 --> 00:42:41.930
fact that people defend that as if it's

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.089
like well you know it's like dude it's

00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:46.549
[ __ ] nuts what they did it's not like

00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:48.199
just them anyone else everyone else is

00:42:48.199 --> 00:42:50.869
trying to do it too or they just won the

00:42:50.869 --> 00:42:54.019
Catholic Church yeah yeah it is crushed

00:42:54.019 --> 00:42:57.709
everybody with what this military no no

00:42:57.709 --> 00:43:02.329
no I mean like it was Rome Rome went and

00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:03.920
spread it and you know that stuff yeah

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.559
but I don't know just wow yeah I mean

00:43:06.559 --> 00:43:08.390
that's yeah that's the history

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:12.799
throughout like as people [ __ ] first

00:43:12.799 --> 00:43:13.789
some people hear this and they're like

00:43:13.789 --> 00:43:15.410
well what's the big deal and it's like

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:16.939
that's pretty [ __ ] big deal to think

00:43:16.939 --> 00:43:19.400
that like the whole huge religion is

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.170
based off of like a bunch of weird

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.910
fertility cults and again we have all

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:25.939
these weird traditions like the drinking

00:43:25.939 --> 00:43:27.589
blood and eating flesh and [ __ ] and

00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:29.599
never was this kind of like that's what

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:32.420
we do it's [ __ ] nuts dude that every

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.219
time I go to I go to church like once a

00:43:34.219 --> 00:43:35.900
year with my mom there every year I stop

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.699
in there I'm like what people are

00:43:37.699 --> 00:43:39.410
chanting in unison that I pretending to

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.029
drink blood out of a cup and I'm like

00:43:41.029 --> 00:43:43.670
what the [ __ ] are you guys doing this is

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:44.449
crazy

00:43:44.449 --> 00:43:46.729
yeah it's I mean not even hate no if you

00:43:46.729 --> 00:43:47.989
like if you like to pray and do your

00:43:47.989 --> 00:43:50.449
thing that's cool but it's weird to me

00:43:50.449 --> 00:43:55.789
to be like well I mean it's supposed to

00:43:55.789 --> 00:43:58.309
be but you're pretending it's like dude

00:43:58.309 --> 00:44:00.410
that really [ __ ] me a [ __ ] when I was a

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:01.999
kid and they were like that's a Catholic

00:44:01.999 --> 00:44:05.269
it's a miracle it's like that is the

00:44:05.269 --> 00:44:10.789
blood and body of Christ so no there's

00:44:10.789 --> 00:44:13.189
no chance it's just [ __ ] weird psych

00:44:13.189 --> 00:44:13.549
hold

00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:16.930
what drove the figured no there's a

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:18.609
[ __ ] there's a Catholic word when they

00:44:18.609 --> 00:44:21.069
change this in the little box a chalice

00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:24.039
no the box that what the [ __ ] is the box

00:44:24.039 --> 00:44:26.559
called sacristy sacrament whatever the

00:44:26.559 --> 00:44:28.809
Ark it is the Ark dude what it when it's

00:44:28.809 --> 00:44:30.730
in the box and then they yeah they

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:35.619
[ __ ] they put it in the cup and the

00:44:35.619 --> 00:44:37.259
chalice and hold their hand over yeah

00:44:37.259 --> 00:44:39.789
yeah but there's a word for what the

00:44:39.789 --> 00:44:42.460
Eucharist becomes the host no like

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.559
there's a word for the transfiguration

00:44:44.559 --> 00:44:47.079
from bread to flesh I forget what it is

00:44:47.079 --> 00:44:54.640
Oh communion no holy [ __ ] damn dude

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.039
Seeger podcasters getting the pot yes go

00:44:57.039 --> 00:45:00.549
no even all now that book is sick the

00:45:00.549 --> 00:45:02.109
Christmas tree thing is hilarious to me

00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:04.660
yeah cuz no I was I've literally wanted

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.099
that before like why the [ __ ] do we put

00:45:06.099 --> 00:45:07.839
Christmas trees our house yeah I think

00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:10.059
that's a newer tradition putting

00:45:10.059 --> 00:45:12.119
Christmas trees in your house how new I

00:45:12.119 --> 00:45:14.440
don't know I don't know either dude I

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.720
think it's relatively new what are you

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:28.230
thinking [ __ ] I'm guessing 19th century

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:33.670
no way dude yeah that's what do you

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:36.220
looking at up yeah there's no way it's a

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.539
19th century you're talking about the

00:45:37.539 --> 00:45:39.910
1800s they started Christmas trees yeah

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:45.309
16th century bro okay oh my god is that

00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:48.339
what your guesses or the answer they say

00:45:48.339 --> 00:45:50.440
at least that's what [ __ ] Google let

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.539
me know sure it goes deeper than that

00:45:52.539 --> 00:45:54.670
zOC probably flipped the switch and was

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:56.920
like you can't have this right now they

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.839

00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:03.849

as well yeah but I am excited to watch

00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:17.460
like just churches go out of business in

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:19.380
general you're not gonna see it I think

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:21.720
so never in their lifetime do you have

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.289
friends that like go to Catholic Mass

00:49:24.289 --> 00:49:27.599
yeah probably weekly every Sunday I was

00:49:27.599 --> 00:49:29.369
up there I talked to a guy who was like

00:49:29.369 --> 00:49:31.499
you know our parish and I was like whoa

00:49:31.499 --> 00:49:33.329
you made it through like you made it

00:49:33.329 --> 00:49:34.799
through your 20s and 30s and like you

00:49:34.799 --> 00:49:36.749
well you go back to it that's what I'm

00:49:36.749 --> 00:49:38.670
saying I'm like the way my life

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:41.279
trajectory is if I just can't imagine an

00:49:41.279 --> 00:49:42.720
alternate reality where I was like I

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.279
gotta get down in the Catholic Mass and

00:49:44.279 --> 00:49:47.309
sit there I won't but when you have kids

00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:49.920
sure and you live back home sure you go

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.749
to church it's that's what's weird to me

people have even those Catholics have a

00:50:36.809 --> 00:50:38.640
lot of us are much more comfortable

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:42.630

teacher told us that like Prescott

00:50:47.609 --> 00:50:48.900

have any money you don't see a priest

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:57.600
he's like they were kind of for poor

00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.920
people he said I shouldn't say that when

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:05.100

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:10.490
like getting perspective from a priest

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:13.200
it's like yeah take some dude who's been

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.390

[ __ ] like half existence kind of

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:22.620
thing I don't notice unless he was like

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:25.590
if Catholic priest went Franciscan I'd

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:27.360
[ __ ] with them they're too opulent for

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:27.780
me dude

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.850

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:31.820
where they were like pure brown robe

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:35.940

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.110
like you know like when people fundraise

00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:47.940

that yeah taking shrooms yes that I dad

00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.320

dude anything in your research is like

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.700
shrooms are cool the cool and also

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:47.070
necessary if people switch from you if

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:48.630
we switched from an alcohol culture to

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:50.580
like you go home to the family everyone

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.050

that's Jesus dude you gonna stand up

00:53:20.619 --> 00:53:22.540
that's what I'm saying but if you're in

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:23.950
a workplace and people were just kinda

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:25.660
like oh dude you just got Boris and that

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:26.980

and what people don't understand is

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:34.810
planning a life where it could go like

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:38.530

do all that stuff but people who have a

00:56:43.359 --> 00:56:44.859
family can be like they look around

00:56:44.859 --> 00:56:46.359

00:56:48.369 --> 00:56:50.320
your 30s on an air mattress dude and

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.880
start thinking about your life then and

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.280
like the real real possibility of just

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.830
[ __ ] being like some not cool big

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.480
lebowski type of dude who's just sitting

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:01.450
there it's kind of like yeah not a cool

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:03.310
Big Lebowski is exactly what it is yeah

00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:05.470
your shitty personality that you have

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:07.540
because no one's the big lebowski know

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:10.210
it's a cool loner no everyone has like a

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:13.359
dark [ __ ] like shitty ego that you

00:57:13.359 --> 00:57:16.570
need and like I mean I'm doing well

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:18.280
right now it still sucks

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:22.030
yes [ __ ] nine years yeah of eating

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:24.340
[ __ ] and yeah miserable yeah dude

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.930
like it's not like I've made it by any

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:27.580
[ __ ] stretch to imagine it but at

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:28.750
least I'm gonna point now where I'm

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:31.510
close to doing something sure and that

00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:33.160
was unlikely yeah

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.750
most people don't get that for most

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:36.579
people that try to follow their [ __ ]

00:57:36.579 --> 00:57:39.400
dumb dreams mm-hmm it sucks don't get

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.770
booked like their local [ __ ] inner

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:43.960
city yeah that's one that's one filter

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.000
and then you go to another place it's

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.650
like another filter another another

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:49.809
another but I'm saying that they staring

00:57:49.809 --> 00:57:52.329
down when you're like all [ __ ] ropes

00:57:52.329 --> 00:57:53.859
are off the boat and you're sailing and

00:57:53.859 --> 00:57:55.450
the fear in the dark waters dude and all

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:58.180
of a sudden you start doing 20 30 years

00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.530
down the line you're laying there at

00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:01.390
night I know that's like something you

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:03.099
can't explain to someone I mean I guess

00:58:03.099 --> 00:58:04.690
there's people who have there

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:06.490
having kids is a whole other set of

00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:08.710
existential terror not like your kid

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:10.660
actually like hating you which is hard

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.520
that's horrible a creative person who

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:16.170
creates someone who hates you create

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.240
someone into the world and then have

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.950
them just hate you as a Romanian hate

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:24.730
just be like yeah you're all right this

00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:25.599
kind of sucks

00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:27.220
well that's apparently like a real thing

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.650
like like your parents gotta want to be

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:31.720
your friends yeah my mom calls me all

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:35.289
the time hurts I'm like deeply yeah the

00:58:35.289 --> 00:58:36.789
fact that you're like it really hurts

00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:38.500
their feelings you're not calling the

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.599
perfect sense I want to know but it's

00:58:40.599 --> 00:58:42.549
[ __ ] weird because people make their

00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:45.160
kids thinking like I'm continuing what

00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.660
you're continuing mean you just made a

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:48.010
whole entire different person who has

00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:50.589
real should have real no loyalty to you

00:58:50.589 --> 00:58:51.760
in terms of what they do with their life

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.190
yeah so a lot of people create people

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:55.450
and like this is my legacy and it's like

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:57.849
now you just created a [ __ ] total

00:58:57.849 --> 00:58:59.619
[ __ ] you don't even know what the

00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:01.720
[ __ ] that thing is what really sucks a

00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:05.260
little off topic with my girlfriend like

00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.359
what when she or anybody that's young in

00:59:07.359 --> 00:59:08.770
their 20s and [ __ ] right now anybody

00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:11.380
that doesn't have a career yeah like

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:13.980
right now that generations entire

00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:16.270
existence is to be an Instagram

00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:19.299
influencer or to be like Twitter famous

00:59:19.299 --> 00:59:21.670
or to be like everyone's a photographer

00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:24.880
or a singer or a music producer or like

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.150
a festival organizer yeah all these dog

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:31.599
[ __ ] [ __ ] aspirations yeah it's all

00:59:31.599 --> 00:59:33.069
so that's what's cool is being an

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:35.650
Instagram model if you're a chick it's

00:59:35.650 --> 00:59:37.420
also you can only do that if like you're

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:41.829
kind of set financially on some deep

00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:43.750
level yeah but then it's like I'll just

00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:46.630
work a job and work on becoming

00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:53.400
a meme generator a noble profession

00:59:54.359 --> 00:59:57.099

mm-hmm and everyone's tehram cuz what do

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.309
you do

01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:02.140
they just steal people's material and

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.180
post it and then they get paid it's

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:04.799
awesome

01:00:04.799 --> 01:00:07.059
sounds like the Catholic Church wait

01:00:07.059 --> 01:00:08.259
till you see these guys sounds like

01:00:08.259 --> 01:00:09.910
they're [ __ ] Catholic Church yeah

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:12.519
kind of I mean if [ __ ] Jerry took over

01:00:12.519 --> 01:00:17.289
the world and dominated [ __ ] Jerry is

01:00:17.289 --> 01:00:19.359

straight white guy sure which has some

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:10.089

01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:08.810
I know all about passio and the occult

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:10.580

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.950

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:18.740
podcast were from when Obama was there

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:21.770
was in office and so he's like you

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:23.300
better believe this guy's trying to take

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.190
our [ __ ] guns right now dude this

01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:27.620
[ __ ] communist piece of [ __ ] yeah

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:30.080
yeah he's going in dude I was reading

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.450
the paper about this and they were

01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:33.680
that's one thing in these classes like

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:36.590
girls are almost like they're almost

01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:38.480
trying to compete with like horrible

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.730
statistics so we're talking about before

01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:41.960
we're talking with the suicide rate how

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.730
mostly men kill themselves they were

01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:46.970
like scoffing that and it's like no you

01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:47.719
know

01:10:47.719 --> 01:10:49.489
this these are [ __ ] pretty well

01:10:49.489 --> 01:10:51.860
researched numbers like dudes definitely

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.449
commit to it they kill themselves they

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:56.540
commit the act more infinitum 85% yeah

01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:58.280
way way more I don't maybe know that I

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.620
think it's like 70/30 yeah like it's

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:01.760
something like that and girls actually

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.949
try more dudes do it so the same thing

01:11:03.949 --> 01:11:06.710
applies with conduct disorder when they

01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:08.239
screen little kids they're saying that

01:11:08.239 --> 01:11:10.969
boys are like 2 to 3 which is 20 they

01:11:10.969 --> 01:11:12.380
say 2 to 3 more times

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:13.940
times more likely the scientific paper

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:15.320
it's like you guys didn't nail down

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.850
whether it's 2 or 3 times more likely

01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:19.160
but it's like whatever but their

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.010
argument was that the reason girls don't

01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:24.199
register for conduct disorder as much is

01:11:24.199 --> 01:11:26.660
because they're not their symptoms of it

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.449
aren't like as forthcoming or girls are

01:11:29.449 --> 01:11:31.730
more relationally aggressive so like if

01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:34.250
you know you and I were beefing I'd

01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:36.350
probably shoulder check you yeah I

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:38.140
probably like do a spinning elbow

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:42.260
catch it if you ever beef and I'd walk

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.390
by behind you and dagger you in the

01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:46.600
bathroom

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:56.900
Josie's a classic nerd attack a [ __ ]

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:08.810
nerd move by your boy [ __ ] is that so

01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:11.690
they're saying that women with you know

01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:14.060
the reason women aren't getting just as

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.670
much conduct disorder as men this goes

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:18.410
there more rather than hitting you with

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:21.100
a [ __ ] nerd elbow they'll actually

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:24.170
like set up an event and disclosure from

01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:25.730
it and that's like female aggression

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:28.730
before they want to like keep women out

01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:31.190
of stuff guys I am dude I'm just right

01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:39.170
rule of thumb that the more text under a

woman's Instagram picture the longer

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:44.900
that writing is crazier she is the more

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:47.119
girl rights under an Instagram post if

01:16:47.119 --> 01:16:48.949

01:16:48.949 --> 01:16:51.800

the one girl was like oh well like like

01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:36.079

[ __ ] funny damn people were laughing

01:21:00.829 --> 01:21:02.869
and then people were kind of half people

01:21:02.869 --> 01:21:05.479
were like you're like the the comic

01:21:05.479 --> 01:21:07.839
relief in a sitcom in this shoe in this

01:21:07.839 --> 01:21:10.639
dude it's I was [ __ ] argue with my

01:21:10.639 --> 01:21:11.779
other teachers other day they people

01:21:11.779 --> 01:21:15.529
love to say like greed and dude they're

01:21:15.529 --> 01:21:18.439
saying that uh if I hadn't said anything

01:21:18.439 --> 01:21:21.919
this they were purporting that uh what

01:21:21.919 --> 01:21:24.019
the [ __ ] is it competition is like

01:21:24.019 --> 01:21:25.759
height or like the reason we have so

01:21:25.759 --> 01:21:27.109
much competition in this world is cause

01:21:27.109 --> 01:21:28.639
of capitalism and I was sitting in the

01:21:28.639 --> 01:21:33.579
class and was just like no revolution

01:21:35.829 --> 01:21:38.269
that's in the guy literally I rolled my

01:21:38.269 --> 01:21:39.559
eyes and he was like well I guess Matt

01:21:39.559 --> 01:21:40.609
doesn't agree and I was like that's

01:21:40.609 --> 01:21:42.619
[ __ ] crazy it's insane this thing

01:21:42.619 --> 01:21:44.689
grizzly bears must have capitalism then

01:21:44.689 --> 01:21:46.759
dude that people started bringing up

01:21:46.759 --> 01:21:48.319
there's one lady there's a lady who will

01:21:48.319 --> 01:21:49.639
like it's funny Schmidt well good off a

01:21:49.639 --> 01:21:51.619
Matt says I have one ally in that class

01:21:51.619 --> 01:21:54.480
and uh it's pretty funny

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.390
Wow so she'll like but she it's just

01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:58.950
like dude there were time I to Adam

01:21:58.950 --> 01:22:00.540
Smith and that he was trying to be like

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.520
trying to promote Adam Smith as if he

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:05.010
were a Gordon Gekko and like Adam Smith

01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:06.660
wasn't he was basically being like

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:09.120
futile isms [ __ ] up we're gonna have

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.770
everyone's gonna do their own share and

01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:12.360
get paid he didn't have it he didn't

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.800
think it could for a second

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.150
turned into where people have like

01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:16.500
billions of dollars he thought everyone

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.880
is like work make a little bit of money

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.800
spread it around but then they're trying

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.120
to present him as if and then I was like

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.680
dude that's that's like a part when he

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.000
was taught about the invisible hair that

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.920
got in market he's like and I'm like

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.480
dude there's like a bunch of other stuff

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.620
about him being like you know I'm like

01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:30.210
people will rely on their own decency

01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:32.220
and Bob so he and I was like in anything

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:33.900
it's bizarre to think that like we're

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:35.790
back to basically almost a futile state

01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:37.200
through just money I was like if that

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.400
doesn't say anything about human nature

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.230
I got pre-dates [ __ ] capitalism and

01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:45.450
the guy who's just like did it it's

01:22:45.450 --> 01:22:47.730
crazy there's people there being like I

01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:49.440
don't know I just think if the class is

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.910
so funny he's all we do is talk about

01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:52.500
the news it's like it's ridiculous dude

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.180
but there's a guy he was saying that

01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:55.739
like he's like well I think right now

01:22:55.739 --> 01:22:57.810
what's gonna happen is like with Trump

01:22:57.810 --> 01:22:59.550
it's like people are waking up and

01:22:59.550 --> 01:23:00.870
they're like they're like they're gonna

01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:02.160
get out and actually vote and things are

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.540
gonna change and the teachers like yeah

01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:05.400
I think we'd all agree on that and there

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.840
was we went on a break I'm in the

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.310

he's like Trump's gonna make us vote and

01:23:36.810 --> 01:23:38.910
then so we started talking again I just

01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:40.230
steer the conversation back to where I

01:23:40.230 --> 01:23:41.850

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:44.100

01:24:10.290 --> 01:24:11.640
this is a [ __ ] problem of the human

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.320
spirit dude my whole class is just like

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:21.000
I started talking about today when I go

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.770

the way of a solution all you guys sit

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.969
there was like capitalism's dumb and

01:24:29.969 --> 01:24:31.920
it's like it was revolutionary

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.900
it was crazy when this came out versus

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:35.910
few feudalism was crazy there was like

01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:38.219
the Droid a senior were like the guy

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:41.250
[ __ ] your wife on your wedding night and

01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:42.600
Adam Smith was like alright let's

[ __ ] and slow down like nah cateura

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:46.620

he this guy came from that day I'm like

01:25:01.469 --> 01:25:02.580
I just think you guys should give this

01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:04.080
guy a little bit of [ __ ] credit it's

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.310
like yeah it's not perfect but to be

01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:07.350
like he thinks great it's like no dude

01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:08.640
that's not what they're up against you

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:11.040
guys can't even [ __ ] fathom what that

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.860
was like and that intercept the way they

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:16.110
just said it's so [ __ ] crazy noticed

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:17.550
it well we're gonna vote for the right

01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:19.260
guy it's like you [ __ ] think voting

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:20.489
is gonna help it's like it's not gonna

01:25:20.489 --> 01:25:23.850
do [ __ ] what do you propose dude my so

01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:25.500
this is my Nolan's here my solution base

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:28.140
[ __ ] theories but what I was saying

01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:29.940
is that so

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:32.070
the unions are dying the unions are like

01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:33.360
completely corrupted and [ __ ] John

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.640
Doherty is getting indicted a guy from

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:38.790
the local 98 Oh corruption charges those

01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:40.830
guys those organizations become corrupt

01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:43.430
I think it's gonna have to be I think

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:45.570
some of the Scandinavian countries are

01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:46.739
like this too are like there's tech

01:25:46.739 --> 01:25:48.420
there's unions but like really it's like

01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:50.520
so you have a company and you have your

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.739
employees and everything everything

01:25:52.739 --> 01:25:54.300
should be totally transparent or like

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.980
this is how much we make from these this

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.260
is how much I make we're gonna spread

01:25:58.260 --> 01:25:59.820
that every we're gonna share the profits

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:02.010
in this company but within the employees

01:26:02.010 --> 01:26:03.300
there's gonna be a Council of employees

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:04.560
who decide if people are slacking the

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.239
employees and there's no like middle

01:26:06.239 --> 01:26:07.620
manager who's like you're fired you're

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.150
fired if you're not pulling your weight

01:26:09.150 --> 01:26:10.680
if the hell people vote you're out you

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.100
got to go and then ever you share the

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:15.270
profits and there's the thing we're like

01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:16.500
if you're the owner you came up with it

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.239
you're gonna have the lion's share yeah

01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:19.860
it's like you just can't you'd have to

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:21.120
come up with a thing that works where

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:21.870
you'll get paid

01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:23.970
and other people get paid not like five

01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:25.560
bucks an hour or some like Walmart

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:27.360
[ __ ] we're like really gonna let you

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.830
work 30 hours a week so you can't get

01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:30.900
like any real motive it's a little

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:33.360
sketchy that could calcifying so bad

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.400
things yeah that could imagine some

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.230
female workers clicking up that could

01:26:37.230 --> 01:26:39.270
get bad but then again it would be and

01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:41.100
again this is it's not a perfect product

01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.540
perfect idea I thought about that I'm

01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:44.400
like my solution that could calcify bab

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:45.450
and i'm like it'll have to you'll have

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:47.730
to bypass unions get rid of this weird

01:26:47.730 --> 01:26:50.790
like $8 an hour [ __ ] and then again

01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:52.260
it then just let people if they can make

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:54.090
enough money so if you actually had

01:26:54.090 --> 01:26:55.290
employees that are motivated like yo

01:26:55.290 --> 01:26:57.000
this is how much I'm making if you guys

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.770
just help me and do stuff it's we're all

01:26:58.770 --> 01:27:00.240
gonna split this I'm gonna take a line

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.100
chair because I started this naturally

01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:03.330
but you guys are gonna make a lot more I

01:27:03.330 --> 01:27:04.830
don't need like forty billion dollars

01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:06.990
utilize my fellowship I'm gonna take a

01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:08.190
hundred million is that how it was set

01:27:08.190 --> 01:27:11.430
up kind of yeah based on your sales

01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:13.650
everybody had a base salary I [ __ ]

01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:15.180
loved it everybody had a base salary of

01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:18.030
like 25 yeah and then commissions

01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:20.400
dictated the rest and then based on per

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:24.030
unit it would uh you'd get more per you

01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:25.470
the more you sold a certain unit was

01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:27.810
worth more what's the word for that mmm

01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:29.670
kind of exponentially sure I don't know

01:27:29.670 --> 01:27:31.530
how you're saying but yeah so like you

01:27:31.530 --> 01:27:33.240
definitely had incentive to [ __ ] sell

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.280
yeah it was good

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.480
that's the missing piece would have to

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.210
be you have to have the whole thing

01:27:38.210 --> 01:27:40.260
where you're paying people whenever you

01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:41.820
get it on a [ __ ] assembly line I

01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:44.190
don't know that's and that wall the

01:27:44.190 --> 01:27:46.260
assembly lines are good that's gone yeah

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:47.490
can't even plan for that that's going

01:27:47.490 --> 01:27:49.980
away this robots dude well here's my

01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:55.980
other so again with the assembly lines

01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.470
that's gonna that's gonna go away yeah

01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:59.580
you know I'm saying like that's gonna be

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:00.810
automated so we're gonna have all these

01:28:00.810 --> 01:28:03.030
people out of work so when I would

01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:06.360
completely my whole my whole all my

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:09.090
theories for society rest on gamifying

01:28:09.090 --> 01:28:11.550
everything so we should have war should

01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:13.530
be paintball guns so you keep the whole

01:28:13.530 --> 01:28:15.180
thing going it's like it's a

01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:16.470
never-ending game you can get all your

01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:18.630
citizen and then like all the contracts

01:28:18.630 --> 01:28:20.220
like if you were to like go occupy

01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:20.790
somewhere

01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:22.950
it's like [ __ ] laser tag in real life

01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:23.940
yeah but you'd be shooting with

01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:25.950
paintball guns and you guys guns

01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:27.660
it's just paintball gun who has real

01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:29.340
guns you can't have if you get caught a

01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:31.050
paintball gun if you call it real gun so

01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:32.880
then the government has real guns oh who

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.559
has them yeah

01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:35.789
yeah it has to be a gentlemen's

01:28:35.789 --> 01:28:37.860
agreement but it would be like if you

01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:39.000
were doing a thing we're like every

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.349
almost like the Olympics where it was

01:28:40.349 --> 01:28:41.909
just like this is almost like a warfare

01:28:41.909 --> 01:28:43.260
game where you're just rolling around if

01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:45.420
someone gets caught like shooting a real

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:46.139
bullet

01:28:46.139 --> 01:28:47.909
people probably gang on that guy and

01:28:47.909 --> 01:28:52.020
[ __ ] him up yeah but he has a gun yeah I

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.550
mean but you could have you could have

01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:55.860
no you could have dual helicopters in

01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:57.869
the sky of foul play they [ __ ] do

01:28:57.869 --> 01:29:00.780
something that you give it what if your

01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:02.699
whole team loses so they still have guns

01:29:02.699 --> 01:29:04.020
they could still have that but it's like

01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:06.239
your whole team we're just jumping too

01:29:06.239 --> 01:29:07.829
deep into this for me to get the base of

01:29:07.829 --> 01:29:10.500
like who's on my team it'd be country a

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.730
country back on all we're doing

01:29:11.730 --> 01:29:13.590
countries country by country so it's

01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:14.699
like you would have it would be like an

01:29:14.699 --> 01:29:16.020
Olympic type thing where you play a

01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.639
paintball gun so if I say we went to

01:29:17.639 --> 01:29:19.949
like Syria they would have like a

01:29:19.949 --> 01:29:21.690
paintball Ford thing and if you took

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:23.520
that you did mission crazy talk about

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.619
then the Americans occupy that Americans

01:29:25.619 --> 01:29:28.739
get the money from that it's like the

01:29:28.739 --> 01:29:30.840
book I'm reading really about Total War

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:33.539
like back before Napoleon for the most

01:29:33.539 --> 01:29:36.090
part in Europe in Western Europe every

01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:39.630
army was a professional army of like the

01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:42.329
armies were small yeah and only people

01:29:42.329 --> 01:29:44.250
that were fighting were soldiers they'd

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:46.289
go have like a gentlemanly [ __ ] stand

01:29:46.289 --> 01:29:47.369
there and shoot each other kill each

01:29:47.369 --> 01:29:49.260
other but it was just a battle sure and

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:51.239
that just that was what happened yeah

01:29:51.239 --> 01:29:53.550
and the armies were small everybody was

01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:55.139
a professional soldier like they weren't

01:29:55.139 --> 01:29:58.500
like the draft wasn't there it was just

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.989
like mercenaries and [ __ ] dudes that

01:30:00.989 --> 01:30:02.400
are like I'll represent this King for

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.770
this flight but it stayed there yeah

01:30:04.770 --> 01:30:06.480
just that fight you know like all right

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.070
they won they get this fort they get

01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:09.750
this territory yeah and then it got to

01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:10.710
the point where was like alright we're

01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:12.840
gonna bring everyone we have bringing

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.369
the whole crown everybody and then it

01:30:14.369 --> 01:30:16.469
got too big but yeah it was kind of like

01:30:16.469 --> 01:30:18.360
just a small skirmish that'd be tight

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.070
you ever wins gets it dude if they could

01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:21.630
be like all right was it fairly we have

01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:22.770
to stop [ __ ] blowing each other up

01:30:22.770 --> 01:30:24.300
let's just make a big game out of this

01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:28.619
and it's still the same thing you know

01:30:28.619 --> 01:30:29.789
and it's like dude someone get you could

01:30:29.789 --> 01:30:31.079
get a little kid hit in the eye so

01:30:31.079 --> 01:30:32.159
there's still like the danger element

01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:33.630
it's a little kid could walk out about

01:30:33.630 --> 01:30:35.760
rapes we're still having rapes any

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.349
people got yeah there's people yeah

01:30:37.349 --> 01:30:38.880
there's me some paintballs rape serious

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.530
that might actually be yeah it might be

01:30:40.530 --> 01:30:42.750
a qualifier I was thinking to like the

01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:44.309
vest you'd have to sing something up

01:30:44.309 --> 01:30:46.320
were like if the vest gets hit the

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.400
person you have to have it's like the

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.060
person just like

01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:51.510
yeah aces are more down yeah but yeah

01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:55.110
there's gonna be instantly the people

01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:56.760
with guns I know I thought if it's like

01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:00.540
a high priority superhot whoever wins

01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:04.080
this gets land sure if I lost I'm gonna

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.490
be alright you think they'd be freezing

01:31:05.490 --> 01:31:06.540
gobstoppers and put them in the

01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:13.490
paintball guns yeah of course yeah uh

01:31:13.490 --> 01:31:16.140
your theory is that we'll be tight if

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:17.400
you're presenting this to me as though

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.360
I'm a shark sure I'm gonna say Matt no I

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:23.040
love your [ __ ] charisma

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:26.690
you're excited about it your idea stinks

01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:29.280
thank you for your time dude here's my

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:31.140

my school let him go dude I'll listen

01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:38.130
here's my school idea and this I think

01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:40.440
would actually work I still I'm still in

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:41.910
the [ __ ] paintball military but you

01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:43.920
know what motors are cool we're away

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.600
from there I'll be so [ __ ] for that

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.850
damn it you're not gonna marry trooping

01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:49.170
yeah and you're just like you're never

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.820
gonna witness paintball football

01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:52.170
military and you're never gonna witness

01:31:52.170 --> 01:31:55.940
the fall of the church in your life

01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:59.420
we'll say follow the church that'll be

01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:01.560
it's gonna be there when you're dead I

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.900
don't know the Catholic Church is gonna

01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:05.670
be around yeah the Catholic Church could

01:32:05.670 --> 01:32:07.410
live off of itself forever yeah [ __ ]

01:32:07.410 --> 01:32:10.500
fat untick yeah it's a parasites gonna

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:11.010
be there

01:32:11.010 --> 01:32:12.960
sure I'm saying in terms of being like

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.610
an institution Nadel the Pope will be

01:32:14.610 --> 01:32:16.560
like the Pope almost is now synonymous

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.090
to the Queen of England where it's a

01:32:18.090 --> 01:32:18.630
figurehead

01:32:18.630 --> 01:32:21.690
sure I don't yeah but like nobody gets

01:32:21.690 --> 01:32:23.550
route off the Queen's words and I think

01:32:23.550 --> 01:32:25.230
I'll at some point in my life the Pope

01:32:25.230 --> 01:32:27.540
will be like I did like everyone

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:29.550
unanimously you big [ __ ] the Pope and

01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:32.460
ever like whatever yeah I was like my

01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:34.920
mom dude freak your mom's very Catholic

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:36.750
very can you can go outside and say [ __ ]

01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:38.700
the Pope and no one's gonna care my mom

01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:41.820
will be mad if I said [ __ ] you distorted

01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:45.720
if I said your paternal for sure did

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:48.030
influence cuz you can go on stage right

01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:49.410
now and be like yeah the Pope's [ __ ]

01:32:49.410 --> 01:32:51.060
gay for the Pope and sure literally

01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:52.800
people be like is he trying to be edgy

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:56.220
there's nothing edgy about this I'm

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.130
right then so then the church is falling

01:32:58.130 --> 01:33:02.080
their stranglehold did they weren't

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:03.910
I've been gay [ __ ] hipsters dreams

01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:05.110
don't come true guess who they're

01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:07.270
crawling back to but they're getting old

01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:09.130
mm again a shitty job they're having

01:33:09.130 --> 01:33:12.400
[ __ ] and then comes the old church I've

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.650
always said the buy stock and drug

01:33:14.650 --> 01:33:15.910
companies because there's gonna be a lot

01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:19.630
of people [ __ ] these dude yeah buy

01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:21.310

01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:23.470
against masters I'd buy stock and Pfizer

01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:26.200

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.130
hate masters dude do you love America

01:33:29.130 --> 01:33:31.300

01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:33.460
what I don't I'm not like I don't

01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:35.140
particularly love I think it's a I'm

01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:39.910
glad I live here like joking around

01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:43.120
those but I was actually thinking I want

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:45.370
you do I am like now I mean I travelled

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:46.960
outside of there I was like glad to be

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.460
back this place is significantly better

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:50.200
but here's what happens yeah you come

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:52.750

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.140
have run right to the showerheads

01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.070
there's like oh there's an electric

01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:13.810
heating element right there and if you

01:34:13.810 --> 01:34:16.060

was there's do they just sit there and

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.530
wait it's called a flying tap they're

01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:31.000
legal in America that you have to know

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.710
the wire has to be like either in like a

01:34:32.710 --> 01:34:34.780
conduit like a pipe or like they were

01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:37.060
does a wire came out of the wall and hit

01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.380
near a shower and just had two little

01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:39.790
wire nuts and then you'd reach up that

01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:41.410
did it with your like you'd open your

01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:43.480
hair or shampoo and I got shocked like

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:45.490
multiple times make [ __ ] yeah

01:34:45.490 --> 01:34:48.490
I'm wet in a tiny-ass bathroom it's

01:34:48.490 --> 01:34:50.050
create it probably didn't kill me cuz it

01:34:50.050 --> 01:34:53.140
was like 40 volts so there's some house

01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:58.600
lost its power I schools my other idea

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.730
they know let's do that simple dude

01:35:00.730 --> 01:35:02.320
that's just game of fine that's just

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.790
turning instead of having tests and

01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:06.340
stuff there's news have teams it's like

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:07.930
almost like family few typestyle we're

01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:09.430
in a class the whole time it's just a

01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:11.590
[ __ ] it's a battle and if anyone's

01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:13.210
identified as like not participating or

01:35:13.210 --> 01:35:15.240
like consistently being a [ __ ] idiot

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:18.240
you just get sucked to another class no

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:20.010
I think that'd be great and you as soon

01:35:20.010 --> 01:35:21.180

okay game fi the world yeah but you know

01:36:12.930 --> 01:36:15.000

why it's never even we're living off the

01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:19.310

we got a long way we're on the we're on

01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:24.690

all the history [ __ ] maybe they don't

01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:41.730
[ __ ] like it that's my thinking work

01:36:41.730 --> 01:36:43.080

01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:49.260
and I won't I'm almost done but it's

01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:51.360

01:37:02.250 --> 01:37:02.970
isn't for you

01:37:02.970 --> 01:37:05.570
I'm not gonna focus on other [ __ ] I'm

01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:07.650
hard at it man there's a lot of charter

01:37:07.650 --> 01:37:09.120

like drawing better than math go draw

01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:17.190
that's what I'm talking about dude yeah

01:37:17.190 --> 01:37:18.950
I think there's problems with it though

01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:21.180
dude it's definitely a ton a problem I'm

01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:22.680
basically mathematically illiterate

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.480
there's people that are very Pro like

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:25.590
those types of charters

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:27.300
I mean to that yeah there's some schools

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:27.870
are like it

01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:29.760
