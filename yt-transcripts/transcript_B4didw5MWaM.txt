00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:16.000
completely normal to drink like six

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.079

all growing up i was like yeah you have

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.240
like four or six beers every night you

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.680

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.839

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.079
oh what's the problem with amazon amazon

00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:19.280
[ __ ] rules dude let's play it on the

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:19.680
table

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.119
it obviously does and exploits the

00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:23.119
living [ __ ] everyone out of everyone

00:47:23.119 --> 00:47:25.760
well how they give everyone 16 an hour

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.720
they don't

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.680
they give subcontractors 16 an hour they

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.800
get that then they hand it down to

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.480
someone even smaller and it's just like

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.520
the [ __ ] they did we talked about

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.119
handing down someone even smaller

00:47:35.119 --> 00:47:37.520
they say oh we pay everyone 16 an hour

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.640
then you see all those private

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.000
contractors with amazon

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.359

and they get subcontractors to do all

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.319
their work like all their

00:47:58.319 --> 00:48:00.319
shipping and stuff like that those are

00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:02.640
people who are subcontracted by amazon

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.760
subcontractors

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.720
yeah so it's not true they're lies so

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.440

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:10.400

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.680
capitalism or are you more of a social

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.480

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.559

00:48:20.559 --> 00:48:21.280

and regulate it step the [ __ ] out but

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:24.480
then

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.559
amazon would even run further amok how

00:48:28.559 --> 00:48:30.720

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.440
also dude you got to keep in mind the uh

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.520
i think who was it stanley milgram is

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.200
like the electro shock inspired like the

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.720
obedience experiment 60

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.720
of people would deliver like what they

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.079
believed was like a harmful electric

00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:11.520
shock just because a person in a lab

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.200
coat like was like do it do it

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.520
do it sixty percent of people would be

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.880
and just turn the juice off

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.520
while a guy was like so every once in a

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.720

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:32.960
combined them

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.640

back dude

00:52:52.559 --> 00:52:54.559
that's the same thing with the elections

00:52:54.559 --> 00:52:55.760
it's over

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.800
what do you think i'm saying what are

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.240
you doing i mean they're currently going

00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.599
through all the numbers now it's not

00:52:59.599 --> 00:53:00.720
over

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.839
i'll tell you right now if you're on

00:53:01.839 --> 00:53:02.960
that side of history it's going to look

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.119
pretty bad on you in a couple weeks

00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:06.640
we know what's out of history thinking

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.920
that joe biden won because the

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.599
associated press had said i don't think

00:53:09.599 --> 00:53:11.520
anybody will care

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.880
are you serious like 30 years yeah

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.240
they'll just wash that in here this

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.920
seems like a very historical

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.319
time we're living in they're proving

00:53:18.319 --> 00:53:20.480
fraud on a large scale

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.240
dude we're all propagandized out of our

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.160
minds right now but that's happening

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.599
like joe biden didn't have a bigger

00:53:25.599 --> 00:53:27.680
turnout than [ __ ] barack obama

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.880
i don't know i wasn't there i think he

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.119
did just uh because of mailing

00:53:31.119 --> 00:53:33.359
yeah that's [ __ ] how that makes

00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:34.880
sense though like people that

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:36.160
weren't gonna leave their house to go

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.440
vote would just sit there and be like

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.559
all right

00:53:38.559 --> 00:53:41.599
would you no i did not yeah exactly

00:53:41.599 --> 00:53:43.839
but i wouldn't care if i wanted to do it

00:53:43.839 --> 00:53:44.800
yeah but they literally

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.559
sent the ballot to somebody's house

00:53:46.559 --> 00:53:48.079
that's why the numbers were so high

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:49.760
i hear you but they sent ballots

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.920
everywhere there the numbers could

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.599
not add up they could have here's all

00:53:53.599 --> 00:53:54.640
i'm saying about in terms of

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.160
billionaires and stuff

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.359
i'm not saying they're awesome or

00:53:57.359 --> 00:53:59.040
anything it's just we've always had

00:53:59.040 --> 00:53:59.680
kings

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.920
yeah we always had rulers they're our

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:03.359
whole system set up for people

00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:05.119
to overthrow we don't need to listen

00:54:05.119 --> 00:54:06.240
nobody's going to do it nobody's going

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.040
to do it

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.480
they're going to give you if you try to

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.240
uh what is it you try to like conduct

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.520
never thought i'd see you being a sheep

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.800
like this not being a sheep i'm just

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.240
giving people the straight facts dude

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.119
otherwise they you know

00:54:15.119 --> 00:54:16.160
we're always going to have something

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.680
yeah we might as well just get used to

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:18.319
it we've always

00:54:18.319 --> 00:54:19.520
been getting used to it so you have to

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.960
come to grips with the fact that it's

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:21.599
not like they're

00:54:21.599 --> 00:54:26.079

voting systems that

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.400
your vote hasn't counted probably since

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.000
2008.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.640
i i don't yeah it's pointless even if

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.920
your vote did count

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.079
the person you elect you still don't

00:54:56.079 --> 00:54:57.520

yeah dude he [ __ ] rules

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.319

00:55:12.319 --> 00:55:13.680
that people i'm i think i'm getting

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.440
misrepresented i'm like dude

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:16.640
we have rulers there's people with

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.400
billions of dollars who can literally

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.319
get laws created yeah and people like

that's that's what i'm saying

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.760
this just happened where everyone got

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.440
locked down and no one said anything

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.640
yeah no because you're still

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.400
participating in that system that

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.000
totally [ __ ] subjects you to being a

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.359
total peasant so unless people unless

00:55:41.359 --> 00:55:42.960
people want to become agrarian

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.799
that's what you have to deal with it's

00:55:44.799 --> 00:55:46.559
like live off the land

00:55:46.559 --> 00:55:49.680

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.799

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.240

put it back together one of my favorites

00:57:17.119 --> 00:57:20.400
yeah i'm saying there's a reason this

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.680
[ __ ] happens because i get coached in

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.040

getting things to fight each other dude

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.559
i was thinking about that today how it's

00:58:20.559 --> 00:58:22.400
like there's a lot of more people who

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:22.960
are just like

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.559
starting to fight each other that's a

00:58:24.559 --> 00:58:26.319
that might be a sign of like an economic

00:58:26.319 --> 00:58:27.359
turndown

00:58:27.359 --> 00:58:29.520
like a lot more people are fighting now

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.040
seeing like comedians fight each other

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:31.760
i'm seeing

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.160
jake getting into fighting yeah like

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.920
videotaping themselves oh no i think

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:36.640
that's boxing

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:38.799
rogan the boxer's fighting i think joe

00:58:38.799 --> 00:58:40.799
rogan did jiu jitsu so everyone was like

00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:42.559
i love jiu-jitsu

00:58:42.559 --> 00:58:44.559
for real that's that's exactly how that

00:58:44.559 --> 00:58:45.599
happens you think so

00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:48.880
yes in comedy yes yeah

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:50.640

what are you talking about yeah that

00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.400
i think i think it's something you

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.160
should do you should know how to do jiu

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.440
jitsu yeah dude i think that could be

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:01.839
the thing

00:59:01.839 --> 00:59:05.119
you're wrong that was nasty dude

00:59:05.119 --> 00:59:08.640
you went to a couple of jiu jitsu houses

00:59:10.319 --> 00:59:12.240
what if you try to do jiu jitsu i mean

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.440
like what's stopping you from punching

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.240

what's stopping you from punching me

00:59:15.359 --> 00:59:16.960
just getting if you're inside on someone

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.160
you can't really swing that

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.440
effectively if someone closes the

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.520
distance i don't know i mean i feel like

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.359
if you just start wailing on someone the

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:24.160

one actually you're an anti-vaxxer

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:14.159
that's what they did they didn't ask oh

01:09:14.159 --> 01:09:15.520
here we go jesus christ

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.679

01:09:17.679 --> 01:09:19.279
just so perfect that they rolled out

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:21.279
this weird anti-vaxxer thing

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:23.199

also too people forget that drug

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:48.480
companies have

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.159
they have millions of dollars to spend

01:09:50.159 --> 01:09:51.600
on people creating content

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.920
to like kind of achieve their aims so

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.600

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.239
campaigns

01:09:56.239 --> 01:09:57.520
we got to get rid of this whole problem

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.159
with people but what if their goal is

01:10:00.159 --> 01:10:03.199
to try to help america not have coven

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.800
it would make me feel a lot better if it

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.640
didn't come from a lydia a lineage of

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:07.440
people who were

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.960
yeah but the last four flu shots were

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.640
ineffective astrazeneca

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.320
just made it so you can't sue them for

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.920
their covet thing that's coming out

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.040
yeah if they're koga shot you're not

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.159
going to be able to assume if anything

01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:45.920
bad happens gee that works out great for

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.120
them well no the problem is

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:47.920
that's because they're just trying to

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.320
roll it out

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.040
they're trying to roll it out fast oh yo

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.400
don't sue us at the same time we're

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.840
going to make tons of money on this and

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.840
you can't do it well the reason that you

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.360
well no they're trying to of course

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.880
they're going to make a trillion dollars

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.400
yeah yeah obviously but they're trying

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.920
to roll it out fast and they're trying

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.360
to protect themselves if they had to

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.719
follow those rules of

01:11:06.719 --> 01:11:08.480
you can see what family we wouldn't be

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.560
getting the vaccine quickly

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.480
six yeah but the problems the way they

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.760
can do it is that no

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.679
they could do i'm not worried about it

01:11:15.679 --> 01:11:16.800
i'm not losing sleep

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.320
i'm not taking i'm not worried about i'm

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.760
just not taking that thing dude it

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.159
they told me i couldn't fly

01:11:24.159 --> 01:11:26.159
to do stand up might as well just laugh

01:11:26.159 --> 01:11:27.679
if you do that you might as well put

01:11:27.679 --> 01:11:30.159
just poor keeps on your head no it's

01:11:30.159 --> 01:11:30.719
over no

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:32.239
get the covert shot poor keeps on your

01:11:32.239 --> 01:11:33.520
head what if it doesn't do anything to

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.000
me

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.120
it's it's not good you don't know it's a

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.400
[ __ ] vaccine that's going to be

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.679
released in under a year

01:11:39.679 --> 01:11:41.600
boy okay i'm not going to get it first

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.120
you are

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.960
first of all you're going to see a

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.280
commercial

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.960
well dude i've been drunk and tricked

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.880
into being like i'll get that [ __ ]

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.600
thing right now

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.679
dude they can take as many studies as

01:11:53.679 --> 01:11:55.040
they want a drug company can do

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.880
i got drunk and listened to the roggies

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.719
episode with that guy who

01:11:58.719 --> 01:12:02.560
uh uh [ __ ] yeah guy who loved kobe's

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.080
yeah it's not going to be ever till

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.239
20-24 he seemed

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:08.000
pretty good i got tricked i get tricked

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.760
by whatever i'm listening to

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.520
that guy got me drug companies have a

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.040
horrible reputation of just putting

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.400
stuff out and just trying to make money

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.040
and then

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.640
the way you can do it is you get put out

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.000
put out a thing like oxycontin you put

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:18.560
that out

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.760
make a ton of money and then you just

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.120
pay fines but you still make more than

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:21.679
you know

01:12:21.679 --> 01:12:22.719
it's like they knew that was bad for

01:12:22.719 --> 01:12:24.080
people they knew what that was and then

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.520
those same companies are now going to do

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.239
a

01:12:26.239 --> 01:12:29.040
i think the way it works is it sends out

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.120
like does something with your mrna

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.560
and it like alternatively makes your

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.239
body produce these little spiky things

01:12:34.239 --> 01:12:35.440
to go out and fight the other ones but

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.560
it's also like

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.920
what if that keeps occurring over and

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.040
over and over and over and over and you

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.159
know then you start to get like cancer

01:12:40.159 --> 01:12:41.280
and stuff sure i don't know how the

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.400
vaccine works at all

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.920
it's like because it's like i just don't

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.239
know if it's a bad thing to have a

01:12:46.239 --> 01:12:47.840
vaccine hardcore they can do it i'm not

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.040
taking it and the thing with the

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.800
what if yeah i'm not i'm waiting for

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.080
certainly i wouldn't take it

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.480
it only works if enough amount if enough

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.760
people take it otherwise it's kind of

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:56.800
uneffective yeah

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.960
i haven't done [ __ ] this whole time i

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.800
haven't even got the sniffles yet

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.239
but yeah i mean because it doesn't if it

01:13:02.239 --> 01:13:03.840
affects like one percent of people so i

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.199
understand it but like it's not this

01:13:05.199 --> 01:13:06.080
whole crazy thing

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.440
six percent of people are done i'm not

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.440
arguing that obviously i'm not

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.840
i literally it's just really around

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.040
people

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.040
not you you're my boy it's weird to see

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.719
people virtue signal about getting the

01:13:16.719 --> 01:13:18.080
vaccine it's like this is kind of

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:18.800
[ __ ] weird

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.080
yeah i would pulled out by the people

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.520
you probably don't really like that much

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.120
would never virtue signal about getting

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:23.440
it

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.840
but i i'm not i'm not ruling out getting

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.120
it but that's what's gonna happen

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.120
with tinder and all that [ __ ] like

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.400
that's gonna be it i mean

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.360
i've never i don't think i've ever

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.440
gotten a vaccine since i was a kid

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.120
yeah like i've never gotten like shots

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.960
or anything certainly not flu shots but

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.400
you won't be able to online date without

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.520
telling you man they're gonna they're

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.360
gonna do whatever studies that's fine

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.640
they're just gonna do all those studies

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.159
and go oh go here's a good one we'll do

01:13:46.159 --> 01:13:47.199
this one it's like

01:13:47.199 --> 01:13:49.280
i'm not taking that [ __ ] thing man

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.560
yeah yeah

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.360
what if it works it works for what what

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.080
it's good

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.920
they're good vitamin d no what if that

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.120
covered vaccine works

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.800
i'll give you my it could work what are

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.239
the side effects that's the thing

01:14:00.239 --> 01:14:02.159
what are the long-term side effects

01:14:02.159 --> 01:14:03.199
they're not going to know they're going

01:14:03.199 --> 01:14:03.600
to have

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.000
no idea of long-term side effects yeah

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.840
so whether or not they like the short

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.280
terms or like whatever

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.679
they have no idea of the long-term side

01:14:11.679 --> 01:14:12.800
effects so

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.239
you release this thing we'll see what

01:14:14.239 --> 01:14:15.840
happens you release this

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.840
and then you just slowly stop testing

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.480
and then the numbers magically go down

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.120
yeah sure who do you think's behind all

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:23.760
this

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.760
drug companies i don't think exactly

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.800
orchestrated but it's

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.600
dude it's a fitness room it's not even

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:30.960
it's not even that orchestrated

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.080
you guys aren't on the same page as to

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.840
who's behind it i think they can fit in

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:34.960
this [ __ ] room who's behind i think

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.840
he's just true i think it's just drug

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:36.480
companies

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.239
drug companies and then drug companies

01:14:38.239 --> 01:14:39.760
hire people to just

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.000
blast content they pay news stations to

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.040
cover this

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.520
drug rep yeah they're [ __ ] i used to

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.120

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.080
it was like pharmaceutical reps yeah i'm

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.520
not disagreeing that the drug

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.719
industry stinks trust humans yeah

01:14:54.719 --> 01:14:57.840
it affects people but

01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.199
people can take it if they want it yeah

01:14:59.199 --> 01:15:00.480
