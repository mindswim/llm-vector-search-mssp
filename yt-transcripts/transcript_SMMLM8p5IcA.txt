no that uh yeah everybody's gonna be

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.040
talking about this show it's literally a

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.040
show designed for

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.719

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.800
teaming them up

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.480
making them date each other it's like

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.160
dude give that's why we have [ __ ]

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.680
weird sex perverts

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.200

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.040
[ __ ] like a [ __ ] lady

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.959
and let her take it let him take care of

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.239
him true you think they can link them

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.440
both up and then be like all right

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.920
youtube

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.640
figure it out get a house like how much

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.760
have you watched it have you watched a

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.720
couple episodes i watched

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.400
two yeah so they'll go on the dates and

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.080
be like hey you guys need a break

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.080
yeah it's kind of like i mean dude the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.680
dates are anxiety provoking we're there

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.640
and they're when they're sitting there

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.599
they put them out together

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.440
about like the shows and stuff and they

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.879
just both freeze up

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.800
they both freeze up yeah dude that must

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.239
be intense levels of anxiety

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.640
so a person with autism putting them on

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.920
camera yeah

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.080
so they can't be like relaxing so if you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.920
haven't seen it it's called love on the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.280
spectrum and it's

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.200
uh that's just a show a documentary

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.800
following

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.440
autistic australians and londoners and

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.560
like in london i think they have a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.120
couple of

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.800
english or is it australia am i stupid

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.720
no they have i could have thought it was

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.440
australia

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.200
i think it's australia and there's

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.800
somebody from

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.680
britain i think perhaps jamie figure

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.400
that out for us

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.840
yeah jamar

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.040
but yeah that that is i it is kind of

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.599
weird man

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.280
the fact that like you know if they're

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.959
right now saying like you shouldn't clap

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.239
because it could set off someone who's

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.760
autistic in like a public gathering it's

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.959
like oh but if you want to like

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.799
put them on camera and film them

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.560
awkwardly trying to date

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.080
it's pretty [ __ ] nuts yeah how about

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.480
the one at the the costume party

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.159
oh and then there's amazon put them

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.239
outside i only saw the one where he goes

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.400
to comic con and ditches his date for uh

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.920
for the lady there's one in thailand

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.920
there's one that's a girl

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.319
and then she went and sat outside with

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.519
this dude and they just they were like

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.239

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.560
this one autistic girl was dancing and

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.920
then another dude came up and started

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.200
dancing with her and they were like

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.319

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.480
[ __ ] nature show they're like oh she

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.400
out there and then they put him outside

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.599
and made him talk

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.239
and the kid couldn't talk yeah because

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.920

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.640

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.280
laughing at them

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.720

but it does you know it is interesting

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.520
that like

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.720
you are allowed to do that you're

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.840
allowed to be like we're going to film

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.120
some autistic people

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.400

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.520
and film it and uh kind of make it

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.160
awkward

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.360
i mean dude that would be sick though if

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.639
they got some sort of like first family

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.560
situation going on like the like london

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.919
royalty

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.120
what do you mean just if they

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.880
established like if somebody said

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.120
kingdom yeah like monarch if somebody

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.800
like links up and produces an offspring

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.240
from the show they probably that's like

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.600
that's like monarchy level

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.759
true that is that one dude finds a bail

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:36.960
on the show basically he's already

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.840
practicing

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.440

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.200
he's kind of a that guy's kind of fraud

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.480
i'm not gonna lie that guy's kind of

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.839
fraud i didn't want to say it but it's

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:08.320

this dude i think he's fraudulent i

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:12.480
think he's in autism for the wrong

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.000
reasons

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.519
he's just trying to get ahead you don't

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:18.240
think it's for the love of the game

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.079
i don't think so at all yeah i think

00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:22.000
he's just seeking fame through tism dude

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.320
like

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.760
all the other australians right now

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.880

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.160

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.920
hope that show works out and arcs in a

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.040
way where like

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.880
you know it's good for everybody

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.079
especially when you see like the the

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:39.760
parents man it's like

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.240
just just to have just like come to

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.240
grips with that and just be like

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.600
[ __ ] what are we doing right now and

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.120
it's just like i gotta talk about

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.920
spongebob for 25 years

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.000
but dude it's like it's like living with

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.440
a black kid

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.880
[Laughter]

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.840
just kidding

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.639
[Laughter]

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:04.000
uh yeah that's my favorite part was when

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.720
i think it's money

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.880
his name's michael right the main kid he

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.560
like responds to his mother like he's

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.040
like

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.560
he literally sounded like a general in

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.160
the revolutionary war she's like

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.680
well if you don't find someone you want

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.639
a date he's like i will not accept that

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:20.160
as an answer

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.360
i was like yes dude get [ __ ]

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.040
it's it is sick how they'll like really

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.720
do and again this is why i think i have

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.920
a little bit of autism

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.519
they'll like pick a thing and that's

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:31.120
just it that guy picked a character

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.800
that's like a revolutionary war general

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.360
type

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.880
the other guy's a dinosaur expert that

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.800
dude's a [ __ ] pimp dude

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.720
wait which one's the dinosaur expert he

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.800
took the uh the one girl out and was

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.600
like

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.639
that might be the third episode i don't

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:44.399

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:46.880
goes on a date with like the tall chick

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.480

kind of like half watching it

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:55.519

i did legion of skanks last week

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.120
absolute unit dude

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.600
i was a balloon in that really i dude i

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.399

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.519
cool that night

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:25.360
once you're dude when you're a big dog

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.519
like that you have to be mystical true

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:29.519
it's tough to like publicly be a unit

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:30.959
and then also be like no

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:32.880
i'm going to take it easy true everyone

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.639
everyone knows there's no moderation

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:36.079
yeah nobody talks about that units are

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:37.279
pretty much pressured into extreme

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:38.240
behavior you have to be

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.160
you have to if you hand like a unit a

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.920
beer like chug this or like i have to

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.600
i have to this is my role yeah i have

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.839
there's no i have to do this

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:47.199
so you lost eight how did you lose eight

00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:49.920
pounds uh i just worked out

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.880
nice did a little keto on some keto

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.639
right now are you on ketosis right now

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:56.639
uh yeah although i did have potatoes

00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:58.160
this morning

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.360
that [ __ ] you up a little but that was

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.880
the first time i broke it since last

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.279
week

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:04.560
really yeah how do you do that uh i'm

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.639
i'm pretty good at eating meat true i

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:07.839
can cross just meat

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:10.079
i tried keto for one day and i like but

00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:11.839
i like clutched the bread aisle thinking

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:13.440
i was going to pass out grocery store

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.959
yeah there's sometimes it's i mean it's

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:16.639
probably very bad for you

00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:18.399
i mean apparently it increases the risk

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:20.160
of spontaneous human compulsion

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.399
nobody wants to talk about that no when

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:24.079
you when you're in ketosis your body

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:25.519
produces ketones which is like another

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:27.680
form of acetone and that one theory on

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.279
spontaneous human combustion is that

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:30.660
people are in ketosis

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:38.050
[Laughter]

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:41.839
okay

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.450
[Laughter]

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.720
[Laughter]

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.320
that's what happened in beirut i think

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.839
there was a whole bunch of people

00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:03.360
in keto at a disco and they exploded

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.839
i think dozens are dead actually really

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:08.079
what if beirut the disco

00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:09.839
i i saw the headline but i was i had to

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:11.440
look into no it wasn't my

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.199
apparently it was a fireworks factory

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:14.560
but um

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.560
slash nightclub i don't know it was like

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.800

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.920
what it was

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.240
what in which case like even if someone

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.759
was playing like sim city i'd be like

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:25.680
why the [ __ ] would you put it there

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.759
like there's no way this city there was

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:29.680
a firework factory

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.639

that i'm going to actually show you

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:39.759
doing this

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:42.240
i uh i saw that in the news and i

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.839
scrolled down to the uh

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:46.639
the allegations the brat is putting up

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:47.519
against eminem

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:50.639
via mariah carey beirut explosion i was

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:51.279
like

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.840
popped out of the other end and they

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.760
like he was like i can't breathe and

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.159

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.200
he jo yeah he jumped out but he was like

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.000
having

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.360
they were trying to raise the whole time

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.720

they're like all right dude like shut up

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.760
we get it get in the car and he just

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.159
went

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:06.720
and popped it out the other side [ __ ]

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.679
and then they did it

00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:09.280
came down on me yeah it's like i don't

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.320
know i didn't know what it was supposed

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.679
to prove it was like yeah i figured all

00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:12.159
that is

00:21:12.159 --> 00:21:15.280
all that it's proving is so that's just

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.880
in response to people that are

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.000
making him that are like deifying him

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.159
so then the the response from the right

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:25.360
and like all those dudes would be like

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.120
he was on drugs dude the guy's a piece

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.960
of [ __ ] yeah it's like dude even if he

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.240
was a piece of [ __ ] you don't get

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.960
you shouldn't get killed yeah for that

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.679
yeah man

00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:35.520
that's what it's just a response

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.200
politically to one another to be like

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.080
here's the body cam

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.440
turns out the guy was actually a piece

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.360
of [ __ ] he was hot he's like that

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.200
doesn't change a thing i i think we're

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.880
being like kind of uh anyway i think

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.240
we're getting

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.600
like right now the demographics are

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.600
coming up where america is hitting 50

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.840
white 50 non-white so i think there is

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.280
like it's like the perfect thing for

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:53.679
like a

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:55.360
just to create tension especially if the

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.400
parties start to melt away it's like

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.600
we'll just like make

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.720
black people hate white people white

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.200
people hate yeah but yeah that's what's

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.400
that's what i think is going down right

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:02.880
now

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.080
because all this stuff like you get it

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.600
you get one side this stuff is almost

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.559
designed

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:08.240
to like make people fight each other

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.679
you'll get like one side of the story

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:10.880
where you know there was like the jogger

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.000
like oh the guy was just jogging

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.280
and then like there's like well here's a

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.320
video of him breaking into a house

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.200
that's the other side it's like oh look

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.320
who we got look who we got and they're

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:16.799
like

00:22:16.799 --> 00:22:18.080
oh and look at this video this guy

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.440
shooting with the shotgun like they

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.159
piecemeal

00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:21.679
sure besides that i don't know that's

00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:23.280
just but i was watching it

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.440
how intentional it is versus just what

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.799
they're doing

00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:28.720
it's like it's like trying to win being

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.840
like check this out yeah yeah

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.240
i was listening to uh to war mode and

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.400
they were talking about how

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.679
like when when shows come out that make

00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:38.320
fun of like

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.520
they were talking about john oliver

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.520
making fun of kind of midwest trash

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.520
going to costco i mean like how come you

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:05.679
sense

00:23:05.679 --> 00:23:07.120
it's not like an agenda it's not like

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.960

for anyone to be concocting and moving

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.520
interviewed by a fox anchor

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.520

anyway and it's like they'll sit there

00:25:22.159 --> 00:25:23.360
and kind of attack each other and be

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.159
like yeah i met him

00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:25.679
real tough guy on the camera turns it

00:25:25.679 --> 00:25:27.760
off and he's like like they sit there

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.480
and like

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.240
now they're like actually attacking each

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.080
other like ad hominem it's really it's

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.360
just funny man it's like

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.559
that's where people are getting informed

00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:37.120
by being like that guy is a [ __ ] dick

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.360
it's like what the [ __ ] hot check rules

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.480
though she rules

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.000
i mean i haven't even really watched her

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.760
once but i saw one question

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.760
hot ass pictures over yeah it's just her

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.520
it's just someone that can be clipped up

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.559
i mean think about this

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:50.159
is she someone who can just be clipped

00:25:50.159 --> 00:25:51.679
up and to go viral

00:25:51.679 --> 00:25:53.120
yeah it's like you don't think they have

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.279
strategy like that i think so

00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:58.000
so it's like for sure but either way you

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.159

in like a cool

00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:33.760
like uh like a bus military vehicle but

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.120
because of covid you just drive in your

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:35.600
car

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.720
yeah so you just sit in like

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.240
bumper-to-bumper traffic and like

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.840
everything yeah and a zebra will walk up

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.279
to your [ __ ] car you gotta hand it

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:42.159
like dog food

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:43.520

00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:46.400
windows up dude it was so bizarre you i

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.760
pulled up and there's a lady in a booth

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.960
to come like scan the ticket off your

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.480
phone you keep your window up

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.520
and you just hold your phone to the

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.120
window and then she scans it and she

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.440
gives you a thumbs up and you're like

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.279
yeah it's really dude i did it i did the

00:26:57.279 --> 00:26:59.679
safari thing with my ex did you really

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:00.799
yeah that was back when you could feed

00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:02.320
the animals though pre-covet somehow

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.360
you're not allowed to feed animals

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.240
during coven

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.679
is that what it is you should be able to

00:27:05.679 --> 00:27:07.360
feed those yeah they they used to give

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.120
you a bucket of food

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.480
and those [ __ ] will stick their head

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.840
that's why they all walked to the car

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.880
though i was gonna say i was like what

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.320
the [ __ ] the point they love coming to

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.600
the car because everybody feeds you you

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.200
went to the six flag safari park no i

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.240
went to a different one in

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.080
virginia but it's the same they're all

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.600
the same dude yeah yeah they're all

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.200
saying do not feed the animals it was

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.880
like strictly don't feed them

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.880
really dude i was like we were driving

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.760
there i'm like dude i would have picked

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.880
up some meatballs and threw them through

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.279
the tigers dude that [ __ ]

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:32.480
all right wait there were tigers out

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.679
there dude so all right you couldn't

00:27:33.679 --> 00:27:34.799
feed there never mind

00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:36.559
yeah there was tigers well if you pull

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:38.399
in it's just like ostriches

00:27:38.399 --> 00:27:40.480
like [ __ ] deer some [ __ ] at first

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.520
i pulled it and i'm like all right well

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.880
this is [ __ ] nonsense

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.960
and then uh you know as you get in the

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.240
animals get a little more exotic you

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:46.720
start getting

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.559
it ends with monkeys which you know

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:50.159
could have thrown them some walnuts or

00:27:50.159 --> 00:27:50.799
something that would have been telling

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:51.840
you they've been fun

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.360
but yeah yeah pretty when you let me put

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.799
my window down but you were there but

00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:56.240
she was such a role meister dude the

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:56.799
whole time

00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:57.919
you can't put your window down i'm like

00:27:57.919 --> 00:27:59.440
dude let me just i hate when babies are

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.880
ruling let me see if i can communicate

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.000
and then they turn on you

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.679
they side with the rules over you

00:28:03.679 --> 00:28:05.120
they'll get mad at you for breaking the

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:05.440
rules

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.360
dude it's unbelievable i just there i

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.039
was i was actually pretty close to a

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:10.320
monkey and i wanted to just like

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.039
say what's up what are you gonna do just

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:14.559
try to make like you see a dog you make

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:16.240
noises try to do like you're just like

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.600
you communicate with this

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.000
i was gonna go like like see what if it

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.200
would like come

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.880
kind of move towards me but why what

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.399
noise was that i don't know

00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:26.320
i'm just making like wild random noises

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.960
yeah noise of the wild

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.480
[ __ ] like that that might have worked

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.000
i'd grab a monkey's attention

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.919
i would you know you think yeah you

00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:36.240
would think

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.520
but yeah it was miserable dude it was

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.960
like it was fun you know it was one of

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.399
those things it's an activity and it's

00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:41.120
just kind of like

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.960
it's a fun activity yeah you go on it

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.240
was cool and you sit and like bump

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.200
the whole time my head i'm like

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.640
logistically like all right so we're

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.840
bumper to bumper people are trying to

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.159
like

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:49.760
because if you're on one side the

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.120
animals are on that side then by the

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.080
time you try it like

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.679
you'll be on the left lane but then the

00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:55.039
animals will be on the right lane and

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:56.640
you got to try to like cut into like

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.399
traffic it's dude it was

00:28:58.399 --> 00:29:00.240
pretty horrible pretty ridiculous man

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.320
yeah my sciatica started acting up

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.240
you have a sciatica yeah if i sit too

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.799
long in a car i start might get sciatica

00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:08.559
what's sciatica it's just a it's a nerve

00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:10.559
that runs all the way from your back

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:12.000
down your leg yeah just a humongous

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.520
nerve and like if i just sit for too

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.960
long i'll just get like shooting pain

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.080
down my leg itself

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.960
really it's uncomfortable it's crazy and

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.080
you were just doing that just to see

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.240
like emu

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.720
emu and you saw kangaroos ostriches

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.240
kangaroo kangaroos were being a little

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.679
lazy they were just kind of laying in

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:28.799
the shade they weren't doing much that's

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:29.840
the other thing too it's like you should

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.640
be able to like

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.919
throw like poppers or something at this

00:29:31.919 --> 00:29:33.360
yeah just like get them get them around

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.559
get your money's worth yeah

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:35.919
that's what we use i mean that's like

00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:37.840
like an air horn just yeah

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.440
like a zoo in china dude they were

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.200
chasing a zebra trying to get out of the

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:41.760
uh like

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.159
the zebra area actually one of them did

00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:45.600
get out into like the other grown to the

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.399
other area

00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:48.559
but when the animals would get where

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:50.159
like they didn't want the animals to be

00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:51.360
there was just trucks everywhere by the

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.279
way they have like uh dodge durangos

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:54.720
that drive around the animals

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.080
and the dodge durango just started

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.840
tailgating a zebra like pushing bait

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.679
literally like an inch from its butt

00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:01.679
just like pushing it back towards you i

00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:02.960
was it was kind of mean i was watching

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.840
like i don't know we're supposed to be

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.880
doing this

the washing machine

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.480

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.000
irish that not do that [ __ ] of like have

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.119
you ever heard an irish person

00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:23.280
legitimately be like yo the [ __ ]

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.119

00:42:25.119 --> 00:42:25.680

what i've i've never heard you you'd

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:31.040
never take an

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.520
if i actually was like [ __ ] england yeah

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.040
yeah or being like dude well obviously

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.560
england [ __ ] me up it's like you know

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.920
obviously it was a long time ago i mean

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.400
i'm pretty

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.520
i'm still traumatized from

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.440
well you can get in i was reading this

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.960
thing for school way back when they

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.040
talked about like intergenerational ptsd

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.960
where like if your grandparents

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.400
experience trauma you can get like

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.240
subconscious flashes of trauma like

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.839
like trauma and stuff dude i don't think

00:42:53.839 --> 00:42:55.920
they understand how

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.920
the world works because all of our

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:00.319
grandparents had trauma

00:43:00.319 --> 00:43:02.240
pretty intense trauma i would imagine

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.240
yeah especially their parents

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.480
yeah you keep going back dude all right

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.760
i'm sorry oh yeah so here

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.880
this is the funny thing it's like you

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.920
know i get the intention behind it but

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.560
racial takes tend to not age very well

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.520
so i heard that yeah exactly exactly so

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.800
it's like like the racial take

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.640
technology gets like drastically updated

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:20.960
yeah

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.040
so like imagine if like if my parents

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.000
have done that been like

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.920
here's all of our racial wisdom we

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.839
bestowed to you on a public platform

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:29.520
by the time that child who's like two

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.520
comes of age and is like 20

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.359
your takes on that are going to be like

00:43:33.359 --> 00:43:35.599
wildly outdated and strange and weird

00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:38.880
yes the chances are people

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.880
their kids won't be like your people

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.160
like they got caught up in kind of

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.920
this weird like this kind of like a

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.400
pan-african movement yeah not even that

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.079
when was it like the 80s

00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:51.839
no this was this was like this this just

00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:53.359
came out they just no but i mean when

00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:55.040
did they record all that

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.319
now like this just happened oh they're

00:43:56.319 --> 00:43:57.760
making it now just did it now and her

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.280
daughter was like really really young

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.880
so it's like by the time you come of age

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.800
i'm bequeathing you this wisdom

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.400
it's just her being like her dad like

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.400
your people come from cambodia

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.240
oppressed by the colonizers dude it's

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.880

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.119

the colonizers

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.880
the colonizers actually opened it but

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.440

you won't know why until it is revealed

00:45:57.839 --> 00:45:59.599
if prophecy speaks there one day will be

00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:00.000

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.240
reason while you're just hanging out

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.200
there will be a golfer from nubia

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.839
impossible

00:46:12.839 --> 00:46:16.640
impossible what did he do in the sand

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:20.560
yeah the uh [ __ ] uh

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.400
yeah dude it was it was painful to

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.240
listen to this thing or just to getting

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.839
i've gotten roped like i got to i had to

00:46:25.839 --> 00:46:27.839
go to the safari park sucked it up and i

00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:28.400
did it dude

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.599
i might be like what are we doing today

00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:32.000
be like do some research on cambodia on

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.599
wikipedia we're going to play a drum

00:46:33.599 --> 00:46:34.400
beat

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.560
start talking like you know we're inside

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.440
if we're inside of like a real like clan

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.440
cambodia we [ __ ] we did [ __ ] them up

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.960
uh in like the 70s

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.480
i think the 80s just 80s who did that

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.680
they got a little [ __ ] up we [ __ ]

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.520
them up in uh vietnam a little right

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.160
yeah

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.240
yeah you're giving them more they came

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.920
in the 80s we gave them what four

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.560
yeah they came in the 80s i think could

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.280
be wrong

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.240
i think the north vietnamese were hiding

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.319
in cambodia

00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:03.920
and because we didn't have a you know we

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.520
weren't allowed to bomb them so then we

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.640
just bombed them

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.440
like we pretended it was a secret yeah i

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.160
mean

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.160
everybody down and every every [ __ ]

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.520
everybody has a bad

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.040
history well i'm just wondering yours is

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.720
pretty recent i wonder yeah i got rocky

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.160
i heard it but they got rocked in world

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.359
war ii

00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:20.880
you know the chinese came down there and

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.640
gave them what for again then

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.079
the japanese came down and gave them

00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:25.599
what for so they got it from everything

00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:26.559
and the american e

00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:28.240
came down and gave them what foreign see

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.599
it's consistent so everyone was giving

00:47:29.599 --> 00:47:30.240
them what for

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.680
everybody gave him up for at which point

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.280
you gotta be like all right step your

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.319
game up

00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:36.640
true cambodia true well no i mean the

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.520
game now is just

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.119
that's also too like so if you have a

00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:41.680
kid you know you raise them in america

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.880

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.520
atrocities

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.599
yeah it's like that's a lot for a kid to

00:47:47.599 --> 00:47:49.119
handle he's trying to fit in and be cool

00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:49.760
and it's like

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.520
never forget the atrocities of these

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.359
pictures yeah we well i didn't

00:47:53.359 --> 00:47:55.280
really experience it but i heard about

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:55.420
it

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:56.640
[Laughter]

so i immediately subscribe the book and

00:48:20.559 --> 00:48:22.079
listened to it i'm like

00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:23.520
halfway through it already did a lot of

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.359
driving last night yeah bro

00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:28.000
the comanche were you want to talk about

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.200
some bad hombres

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.839
were they really bro every time i listen

00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:33.760
to people talk about

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.839
it's crazy if you do any research into

00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:38.240
actually what native americans are doing

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:41.680
it's nuts dude well the celtics were the

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.880
uh you know who were

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.240
[ __ ] kels were here before native

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.680
americans would go on no the celts were

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:46.720
actually even mentioned

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.240
in the book is also being complete

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.880
savages really yeah so what it

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.119
it's a pretty simple explanation for why

00:48:53.119 --> 00:48:54.800
the why native americans were

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.920
[ __ ] fired up rowdy boys yeah they

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.240
got

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.559
they got agriculture about 4 000 years

00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:01.440
after

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.240
africa and asia and therefore europe uh

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.119
so they were

00:49:05.119 --> 00:49:06.160
and they were on the exact same

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.920
trajectory historically like they just

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.520
started building pyramids they just

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.800
started getting societies

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.280
but they were 4 000 years late gotcha

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.400
and then they run into

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.440
you know colonists yeah so and

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.800
that's what that's what was really

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.400
interesting about it was they were like

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.079
they were hunter gatherers

00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:24.640
they were from the [ __ ] stone age

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.599
running into

00:49:25.599 --> 00:49:27.520
today's you know essentially today it

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.440
was like 1800 future man

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.760
yeah so then you'd run into this tribe

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.319
of dudes that were living like cavemen

00:49:34.319 --> 00:49:35.920
yeah and they'd be rowdy dude obviously

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.200
they're going to [ __ ] throw [ __ ] at

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:37.520

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.640
down the command comanche [ __ ] rule

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.040
they absolutely rule they're ugly short

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.240
shitty people

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.200
that everybody crushed so they came over

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.720
and you know historically on the

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.800
land bridge that's where you know how

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.079
all people came to

00:50:26.079 --> 00:50:27.760
sure yeah north america the best they're

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.359
straight uh yeah

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:31.290
so they were up there go on

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:34.160
[Laughter]

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.880
so they were so they're up in the

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.240
rockies they're up in the mountains

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.680
and then just forever they had been

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.280
pushed down because they sucked yeah

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.559
comanches

00:50:42.559 --> 00:50:45.440
of everybody were like even amongst

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.720
other tribes they were known for their

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.240
bad hygiene

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.720
they sucked they were short they never

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.760
you know every

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.400
so we see we see like the northeast

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.079
native americans is like that's like

00:50:56.079 --> 00:50:57.760
what's on yeah that's what you see it's

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.520
like these tall slender [ __ ]

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.800
athletic sinewy long [ __ ] yeah

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.240
these people were like more like

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.800
mongarians really like short squat

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.079
[ __ ] brown yeah like

00:51:10.079 --> 00:51:12.000
[ __ ] like eskimos they looked yeah

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.119
yeah yeah exactly

00:51:13.119 --> 00:51:14.800
but i didn't know that they were losing

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.319
energies were like no yeah

00:51:16.319 --> 00:51:17.760
we're not jackson jesus bodies no

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.079
they're lads really majors were pure

00:51:20.079 --> 00:51:21.200
lads dude

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.480
and they were getting rocked by

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.880
everybody until the spanish came

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:28.160
spanish you know [ __ ] around and uh

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.160
introduced horses to north america

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.280
horses were never there

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.800
yeah so all these different tribes got

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.400
horses and i think the apache were

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.280
munching them

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.040
the apaches maggie weren't sure what to

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.160
do with them so the daddy was just

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.440
crushing horses they're munching yeah

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:39.760
they're

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.599
munching horses they're chopping them up

00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:43.200
they were that was good eating for a

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.800
little while until the comanche those

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.559
old [ __ ] [ __ ] that everybody beat

00:51:46.559 --> 00:51:47.839
up forever

00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:50.880
just somehow got so good at using horses

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.359
like best horsemen in the world i mean

00:51:53.359 --> 00:51:54.640
and then just if you want to go for the

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.000
mongolian theory that's me that's

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.119
exactly what it was like

00:51:57.119 --> 00:51:59.359
and then they just let it rain on

00:51:59.359 --> 00:52:00.400
everybody dude

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.640
oh after getting your [ __ ] on and not

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.559
like they were even like there was no

00:52:04.559 --> 00:52:06.720
half of it was just for vengeance like

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.559
this for ancient vengeance

00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:10.400
for like a thousand years they were just

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.079
like [ __ ] these people

00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:13.839
and just comanche they you know they

00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:16.559
didn't build cities they were nomadic

00:52:16.559 --> 00:52:18.480
they just they just went around and if

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.559
you somehow came into the middle of the

00:52:20.559 --> 00:52:21.440
country

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.640

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.359
not just like oh you got you know they

00:52:27.359 --> 00:52:29.200
it was their rules to torture everybody

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.000
to death

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.520
if they were women they would gang rape

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.359
them and then torture them to death

00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:36.079

00:55:57.359 --> 00:55:59.200
party going on yeah just a thousand

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.240
years before

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.559
people from people celtic tribes thought

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:03.680
they were from hell

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.280
like they conceptualized heaven and hell

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.240
and they're like yeah we're from hell

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.040
we're the bad guys

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.359
like we're from hell and they their day

00:56:09.359 --> 00:56:10.079
started

00:56:10.079 --> 00:56:11.359
it was some kind of weird thing where

00:56:11.359 --> 00:56:13.280
like their day was reversed i mean not

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:13.839
like i know

00:56:13.839 --> 00:56:15.119
kind of the day starts at midnight but

00:56:15.119 --> 00:56:16.160
it was something like that so they're on

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.760
my clock i'm still on there

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.599
something like that yeah where they were

00:56:19.599 --> 00:56:20.880
they were kind of smudging dinner right

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.079
away

00:56:22.079 --> 00:56:23.839
just wake up and eat like a chicken parm

00:56:23.839 --> 00:56:25.520
sub yeah when you uh

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.880
when you were born they would just cry

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.720
for you they'd be like oh dude

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.000
sucks and when you die they have a big

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.440
[ __ ] idea get out of here back in the

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.799
nether room

00:56:32.799 --> 00:56:34.799
yeah they were like nasty [ __ ]

00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:35.920
man

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:39.359
yeah they they the

00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:42.720
the comanche met yeah okay i mean dude

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.160
there's there's literature that says

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.680
that they try to claim the celts were

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.280
the native americans it's pretty funny

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.640
it's a pretty really that's like irish

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:49.520
spazzing

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.990
no we're native we're actually slaves

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:53.119
[Laughter]

00:56:53.119 --> 00:56:56.799
and we're hammered yeah um

00:56:56.799 --> 00:56:59.440
no but it does do the thing where it's

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.000
it also

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.440
is interesting is in the book they're

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.799
like look if you want to talk about

00:57:02.799 --> 00:57:04.720
people's statues getting torn down

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.119
you see a native american chief statue

00:57:07.119 --> 00:57:08.559
you could pretty much count that that

00:57:08.559 --> 00:57:09.119
guy

00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:11.040
first off had slaves and then also led

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.319
like war parties that

00:57:12.319 --> 00:57:15.119
raped whoever they caught and tortured

00:57:15.119 --> 00:57:16.400
really said in the book

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.240
yeah i was like this guy's going hard

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.559
was this what's been early in time when

00:57:20.559 --> 00:57:21.520
this guy wrote i don't know when the

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:22.240
book was written

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.920
yeah he better not have written that

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.599
recently or he's out of here i don't

00:57:25.599 --> 00:57:26.319
like it

00:57:26.319 --> 00:57:27.760
yeah man he can't be talking but it was

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.520
a [ __ ] native american statues

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.760
he brought up the celts though did he

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:32.880
yeah in the book yeah he was like

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.240
they're they were they were that they

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:34.720
were the

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.240
people that like when the romans came up

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.599
to england they were like who the [ __ ]

00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:39.040
are these dudes [ __ ] is this who are

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.040
these [ __ ] guys

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:44.160
um sick [ __ ] book though

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.440
definitely recommend it's way better

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.040
than war on the run i gotta peep that

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.200
out we're on the runs like

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.880
the most the one i'm reading about

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.480
robert rogers yeah it's

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.720
the most reading listening to part of me

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.079
part of me same thing no

00:57:56.079 --> 00:57:57.599
very different very different

00:57:57.599 --> 00:57:58.880
information go through the ether and

00:57:58.880 --> 00:57:59.680
into your brain

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:02.400
part of me it actually might be

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.760
audiobooks might be better

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.119
i don't think they are i think i'll

00:58:05.119 --> 00:58:07.119
forget people's names and have to rewind

00:58:07.119 --> 00:58:08.799
30 seconds to try to get the name again

00:58:08.799 --> 00:58:10.480
i have laser fo i have like laser focus

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.680
there's no chance you do dude i have

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.079
like laser focus attaches no chance dude

00:58:14.079 --> 00:58:16.160
no i dude it's crazy it's unbelievable

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:17.440
how well every time you [ __ ]

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.640
i don't really entertain the information

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.559
i store it all in the ether where is

00:58:20.559 --> 00:58:21.680
that reading the book we have like a

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:22.160
cloud

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.440
reading a book right now sort of where

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.280
they talk about like the so you know

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.000
there's like

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.880
atoms and protons but like in between an

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.240
atom and a proton there's just like it's

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.760
mostly just blank space

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:32.880
and really if you were to take all the

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.559
blank space out of everyone's atoms and

00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:35.119
you know

00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:36.240
particles and everything you could

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.240
reduce the human population would fit

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.680
within like a sugar cube

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.200
that's how much we as you know i mean

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.319
you probably think we live in a solid

00:58:42.319 --> 00:58:43.599
universe which i can understand you

00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:44.880
thinking but

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.520
it's not really the case so you know so

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.480
i like you know knowing

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:50.480
all that ideas are the same kind of

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:51.359
thing where it's like you know we're

00:58:51.359 --> 00:58:52.720
living in kind of like a

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.319
not a simulation but you know more of

00:58:54.319 --> 00:58:55.760
like an electromagnetic field that we

00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.760
kind of perceive as solid

00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.280
um but i mean it's just like i've

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.480
listened to a chapter i basically know

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.400
what verbatim but yeah go ahead please

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.680
no i'm good you want to derail my

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.119
awesome comanche talk no i'm not the

00:59:07.119 --> 00:59:08.319
real name we're too late we were talking

00:59:08.319 --> 00:59:10.000
audiobooks i kind of forget the commands

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.520
talk now i had some other good points

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:12.799
it's in you have to it's in the field

00:59:12.799 --> 00:59:13.839
it's in the ether you have to have to

00:59:13.839 --> 00:59:14.799
channel it

00:59:14.799 --> 00:59:16.880
any idea you ever have oh they did the

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.000
same thing is

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.520
so i was reading [ __ ] yeah i was

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.760
listening to the [ __ ] uh

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.520
war on the run and it's very dry it's

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.520
very like they left camp with

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.880
three satchels of blueberries six

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.000
gunpowder sacks it's a lot

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.920
it's a lot to listen to but then this

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.760
one's just purely like

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.040
they did the same thing though the lady

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.440
who got was a slave to the comanche

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.720
she beat the [ __ ] out of one

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:45.440
lady and made the the apaches or the

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.799
comanches just surrounded her and were

00:59:46.799 --> 00:59:47.839
like

00:59:47.839 --> 00:59:49.440
sick and then she beat the [ __ ] out of

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.359
the old lady who was also her master and

00:59:51.359 --> 00:59:52.160
they were all like

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.280
all right you're pretty chill you can

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.520
come hang out with us dude

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.520
they did have that that's like a common

00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:58.640
string like if you were a native

00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.839
american slave all you had to do was

00:59:59.839 --> 01:00:00.480
while out

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.920
so you're saying if i were ever good to

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.079
risk the worst torture

01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:07.680
known to man yeah so i wonder

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.760
so if i ever somehow and again i don't

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.799
think this would happen to me if i got

01:00:10.799 --> 01:00:12.000
lost on the reservation but if someone

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.040
else if they get you

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.640
if someone yeah if i was to be accosted

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.160
on the right you get hammered i should

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.200
just start

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.799
fighting people if you're at a casino

01:00:18.799 --> 01:00:20.400
and you you know the lights start

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.440
disorienting

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.559
yeah and then you get captured

01:00:24.559 --> 01:00:26.240
you get captured you actually yeah you

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.359
could technically get captured yeah

01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:28.400
bring you downstairs

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.359
true so i should just start swinging you

01:00:31.359 --> 01:00:32.480
should immediately swing

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.760
and if you're in a casino and you're

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.319
drunk and you happen to you happen upon

01:00:36.319 --> 01:00:37.839
a security guard

01:00:37.839 --> 01:00:39.680
swing upon him they'll do nothing but

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.880
respect looks like

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.640

i was just like [ __ ] yeah dude wow our

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.160
bus driver [ __ ]

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.400
i mean a lot of our bus drivers one of

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.079
them yeah one of them definitely

01:01:14.079 --> 01:01:16.640
pissed hot we learned he got fired he

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.359
was [ __ ]

01:01:17.359 --> 01:01:20.319
shit-faced that rules i think it was

01:01:20.319 --> 01:01:21.680
drugs i think it was like hopes

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.040
yeah only it was alcohol yeah i don't

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.640
think you can piss out cold but i just

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.280
know they

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.920
know they they they uh they test they do

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.760
a lot of p-tests on their shoulder

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.160
breathalyzers alcohols they they do like

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.040
a lot of random p

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.480
tests but alcohol is the one that gets

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.079
bus drivers because they're like yeah

01:01:36.079 --> 01:01:37.359
they can't do any other drugs really

01:01:37.359 --> 01:01:38.319
because you know i mean i guess they

01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:39.839
could do some coke but it's like

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.000
that's when they ran into the comanches

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.839
or like those native tribes the apaches

01:07:35.839 --> 01:07:37.440
the comanches and [ __ ]

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.280
kings the short kings the land of the

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.000
short kings and uh

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.280
you know they started getting massacred

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.559
and tricked and [ __ ] what was pretty

01:07:44.559 --> 01:07:46.079
funny is the apache

01:07:46.079 --> 01:07:48.000
where all of a sudden like there's no

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.440
record of what the [ __ ] was going on

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:49.839
there

01:07:49.839 --> 01:07:51.599
other than like you can see migrations

01:07:51.599 --> 01:07:53.359
of other tribes getting the [ __ ] out of

01:07:53.359 --> 01:07:54.000
the way

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.160
from the comanches which is pretty cool

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.920
[ __ ] to be like well nobody wrote [ __ ]

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.280
down they were just wandering around in

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.799
tents murdering everybody for

01:08:00.799 --> 01:08:03.200
a thousand years yeah well not a

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.319
thousand cause they didn't have horses

01:08:04.319 --> 01:08:05.920
yet but

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.119
all of a sudden there was like a huge

01:08:07.119 --> 01:08:09.039
influx of apaches

01:08:09.039 --> 01:08:10.880
running like where the [ __ ] are you guys

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.160
going the apaches were like

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.760
actually spanish we really like

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.080
catholicism could you please set up some

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:16.719
missions

01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:19.759
in our territory and so that the spanish

01:08:19.759 --> 01:08:21.199
were like holy [ __ ] dude we never

01:08:21.199 --> 01:08:22.400
thought you guys were gonna say yes to

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.040
this dude

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.040
wait till you see how awesome jesus is

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:25.839
we're going to bring up some

01:08:25.839 --> 01:08:27.759
missionaries this is going to be fun

01:08:27.759 --> 01:08:30.080
and it was actually just a trick for

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:30.960
them

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:35.279
to put basically embassies in apache

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:37.279
so that when the comanches came down and

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.640
definitely murdered and raped everybody

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.239
they would kill spanish people too

01:08:40.239 --> 01:08:42.319
so that they would go to war with the

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:43.279
the comanches

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:44.719
so it was a pretty funny trick from the

01:08:44.719 --> 01:08:46.560
short king apaches yeah

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.400
but um it was yeah it's just it's uh

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.000
what was nice about was talking about

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.600
the settlers that's how that's how

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.120
america colonized it

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.120
like spain went in with like

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.359
missionaries forts

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:02.400
very governmental regimented

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.440
you know in intrusion into the land

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:09.120
the the americans just sent people

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.040
dudes like literally we're just like no

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.319
forts no missions

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:15.440
just like people building houses go

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.480
check that out which

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:19.679
ironically so the mexicans

01:09:19.679 --> 01:09:22.400
settlers into texas yeah which you know

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.080
eventually the settlers just took texas

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:24.400
yeah

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.839
but the reason they invited them there

01:09:25.839 --> 01:09:27.839
was to get a buffer zone between them

01:09:27.839 --> 01:09:28.960
and the comanches

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.679
really so originally the the mexicans

01:09:31.679 --> 01:09:33.279
which you hear people today be like

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:35.359
the mexican-american war it was another

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:37.359
act of aggression from america where we

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:38.880
took their land

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.120
those [ __ ] invited us there so that

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.080
we could be

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.239
fed to the comanche so they would stop

01:09:44.239 --> 01:09:45.679
[ __ ] with the mexicans

01:09:45.679 --> 01:09:47.679
it ended up that the americans were kind

01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:48.880
of rooting tootin

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.120
true they're slim they were like bro

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.239
we'll [ __ ] chill here

01:09:52.239 --> 01:09:53.920
well we get raped murdered every couple

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.000
years whatever sick texas [ __ ] rules

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.440
texas does rule that's when it became a

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.440
republic bro real that's [ __ ] sick so

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.120
they actually so they fought off

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.800
they were like they buffered and then

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.159
they like they figured they probably

01:10:04.159 --> 01:10:06.560
figured it out we're like

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.560
well yeah they didn't or no they figured

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.920
it out they figured it out

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.520
well yeah they kind of tamed the lamb a

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.280
little the land a little and then this

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.560
the mexicans were like why don't you

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.400
give us that lamb back yeah like why

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.840
don't you come [ __ ] take it

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.600
true that's where that flag is from yeah

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.120
i think then

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.679
then the alamo happened which was a huge

01:10:23.679 --> 01:10:25.120
mistake the texas flag say it's like

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.480
[ __ ] off mexico

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.080
yeah pretty much uh but yeah that's uh

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.199
that well that was a funny thing

01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:32.800
watching uh

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.480
hell or high water that you started to

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.239
think about how that you really had it's

01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:36.719
like

01:10:36.719 --> 01:10:38.480
like and then these colonizers came it's

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.840
like no they kind of white people threw

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.560
just

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.080
they threw poor white people at the

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.679
problem rich white people through poor

01:10:43.679 --> 01:10:45.440
white people the problem and we're like

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.400
here go figure this out yeah and then

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:48.719
really

01:10:48.719 --> 01:10:50.000
and that's that's what they're banking

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.360
on and that's what was cool in the book

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.120
it literally addresses like

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.360
yeah the american approach to colonizing

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.960
was like hope

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.159
like they'd just be like here's some

01:10:58.159 --> 01:11:00.400
dude that's just land hungry that lives

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.920
in boston that's like i gotta get my

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.199
family the [ __ ] out of here

01:11:03.199 --> 01:11:06.080
yeah we're going to the plains they get

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.880
when they get burned alive

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.600
but it's also funny too how that still

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.159
kind of goes

01:11:12.159 --> 01:11:13.600
so you know you get the rich people who

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:14.960
are like yo man we got a good deal if

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:16.400
you go out there do that thing

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.760
yeah i was like laughing the other day

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.360
thinking about trickle-down economics

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.800
how it more or less you know it's

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.000
supposed to be like yo like here's what

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:22.560
you do

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.480
you just let us get all the money we're

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.400
gonna just send it back down to you guys

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.199
and it really

01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:28.320
basically comes out it's like all right

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.000
look you guys are going to be the best

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:30.800
poor people

yeah we're going to get you some change

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.159
i'm going to buy some [ __ ] yeah change

01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:35.600
yeah you guys coming to you you guys get

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.280
the piggy bank that's

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:38.640
like such a funny thing because it's

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.480
like just that

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.920
they really no one ever talks about

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.360
super poor white people who have been

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.719
poor for like genera it's just like yeah

01:11:44.719 --> 01:11:45.920
i was like oh you suck up your [ __ ] if

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.360

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.480
suck up your white privilege they'll

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.080
punch you in the face because like they

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:50.480
yeah

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.400
they cannot get out of poverty they're

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.520
they're so poor

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.800
and every like the [ __ ] around them is

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.920
so [ __ ] up like they're just not

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.440
getting out

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.199
but it is funny for the a lot of those

01:11:59.199 --> 01:12:00.800
