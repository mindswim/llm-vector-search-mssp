00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.000
what are you talking about that sounds

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000

00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:05.280
down there

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.760
[Music]

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.600
yeah i know somebody who uh who went and

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.880
got the krispy kremes and they were

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.760
telling me that

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.679
you go in there and it's just like

00:19:13.679 --> 00:19:15.360
they're playing like really relaxing

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.400
music and there's dudes in like

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.760
camouflage like military

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.440
outfits who are just being like this way

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.320
and you're just listening it's like

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.960
military guys like right this way sergio

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.400
over there kirby's got it

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.440
teddy gerby's got it and said he had to

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.799
you get it and then you have to wait

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:38.400
like 15 minutes to see if you're

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.280
allergic to it

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.039
okay so they just sit you in a room and

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:42.400
you just sit there like all right i hope

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.520
i don't [ __ ] die

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.120
and once you pass that time then you can

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.280
no longer sue them it's like one day

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.960
afterwards and any side effect there for

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.039
like one or two days that's on you yeah

00:19:51.039 --> 00:19:52.000
that makes sense so if you're going to

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.600
give it to the entire country there's

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.039
going to be at least

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:58.160
six percent of people who are like dude

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.840
the school i was at was like they were

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.440
telling me that one time they're like

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.559
they're like the one thing that sucks is

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:04.400
that the parents are constantly trying

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.080
to sue us for everything like just

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.520
caught like we're constantly being hit

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.640
with lawsuits you shouldn't live in a

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.640
litigious society i agree with that

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.320
for sure that [ __ ] pisses me off it's

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.760
[ __ ] lame as hell

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.159
it's bullcrap dude you don't like suing

00:20:16.159 --> 00:20:17.200
no i think it's

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.960
no blue collar lottery not my thing yeah

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.559
not a fan it would be tight though to

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:24.640
get a good lawsuit on somebody

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.400
they're just screwing someone yeah just

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.000
[ __ ] someone shut up

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.200

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.319
outsiders who are the pisces race war

00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:05.520
mexicans all day

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.920
like the cartels and [ __ ] yeah that's a

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.200
that's a good first pick

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.400
do you think the cartels throw their hat

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.599
their hat down yeah yeah i guess they're

00:44:11.599 --> 00:44:13.040
a lot of them that is the best pick you

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:13.839
could have

00:44:13.839 --> 00:44:15.920
yeah if you had had a race draft i would

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.200
pick mexicans yeah but i

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.280

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.000
because i think in jail they call anyone

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.160
who's not white black or uh

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.160

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:11.920
stuff there

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.760
it's just a ploy for white people to

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.520
make black people look bad black people

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.160

and then it was uh they were they did a

00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:41.200

it's gotta be hitting the dinner table

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.960

straight and arrow when i think truck

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.240

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.159

01:13:19.199 --> 01:13:20.800
foolishness they were april fools

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.239
they played with fire and got broken

[ __ ] you no come on i'll tell you girls

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.440
newborn yeah obviously

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.840
oh my god dude hold on what was that

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.280
alright

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.440
classic like they were just bringing a

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.960
hot like

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.560
they were bringing the babes yeah and

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.400
then what they got

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.679
in trouble for though was sex

01:13:55.679 --> 01:13:56.880
trafficking because they would bring

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.320
girls from outstanding whatever

01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.520
i think i mean don't get me wrong there

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.800
were dudes making porn they were

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:01.600
definitely like

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.960
they understand pieces of [ __ ] and

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.320
definitely i don't think any of them

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.280
were underage

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.640
i don't think it's weird how you can

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.320
like get sick but it was like they got a

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:08.880
woman

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.480
but they got tricked like they would lie

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.760
to the girls they'd probably be like

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:12.960
nobody's gonna see this

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:16.640
or like it's only going in europe or

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.239
we're gonna pay like and then they would

01:14:18.239 --> 01:14:19.679
apparently they would have i looked into

01:14:19.679 --> 01:14:21.280
it i looked into it i think porn doesn't

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.320
cross the ocean

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:25.040
i looked into it because this one over

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:25.440
here

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.560
yeah i was listening to war mode and
