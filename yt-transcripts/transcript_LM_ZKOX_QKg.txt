00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.960
showing this feminist was trying to make

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.160
fun of the men's rights activists and

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.360

in summary but the one thing that was

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.120

it

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.400
yeah i watched some of it and i think i

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.759
i think i might have watched it late at

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:33.440
night so i think i was probably just

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.440
tired well like they talk about forever

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.599
about the uh which the customer [ __ ] was

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:40.560
crazy custody [ __ ] was

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.719
it was long but it just

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:45.120
it was really crazy the whole point was

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.480
how they're like you think since i'm a

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.920
girl like what i'm just supposed to have

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.440
babies and be at home with the baby and

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.640
like what guys go out and get all the

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.560
money the way the feminists set up the

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.000
and the feminists the ones who block the

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.560
ones like equalize us is that men have

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.839
to go out and get a paycheck and the

00:08:57.839 --> 00:08:59.680
woman keeps the baby that's the way

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.959
they've set it up so like we don't just

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:02.959
raise kids but like they go for that in

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.880
child court like no we need to keep it

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.480
so the woman gets the kid and then you

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.440
have to give her money it's like all

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.120
right well that's the traditional

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.040

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.480

telling you this today they had

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.959
after they did the thing they did a

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:38.240
youtube like

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.360

men who control society and it's like

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.839

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.120
that out on your own pretty quick yeah

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.120

yeah and then one guy just walks through

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.240
the office and it's like oh that [ __ ]

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.360

illuminati it's like it's easy but that

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.720
was funny to me and it's like

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.320
all right so that that's that's where

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.480
you guys that's what you guys thought up

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.480
yeah the cream of your crop was like

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.240
well it's only like rich guys who

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.440
control everything and it's like all

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.959
right the thing about when i watch the

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:50.399
red pill it's like it sucks that these

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.760
guys are even called men's rights

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.279
activists because it's like all they're

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.200
saying is just normal they're just

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.519
saying the truth that's all it was like

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:58.640
it's just a bunch of people that are

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.959
like yeah we don't really control you

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:02.880
yeah life's hard for everyone

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.000
shut the [ __ ] up that was the whole

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.440
point of the thing yeah and then they'd

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.360
be like a lady you'd be like

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.839
and at the very end they had a uh they

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:11.760
finally did a thing called like men's

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.279
studies i guess from the set of women's

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:15.200
studies and they looked at the [ __ ]

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.720
panel who was in charge of it and it was

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.440
like

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.839
two of the leading feminists from the

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:20.880
movie

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.959
uh another one from like the 60s and

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:24.160
like some other

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.680
it was all feminists who ran the men's

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.200
studies dude so there all the guys were

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.320
like and they're going through the panel

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.519
and they're like

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:30.959
that's funny

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:32.320

how powerful she is and how important

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.560

and a dog and then he saw them one day

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.720
he probably totally missed them too

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.320
because he's like i saw them getting out

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.600

life for a dog to remember dogs happy

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.200

00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:12.320
transers from the military oh it's about

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.320
time

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.600
i didn't think they were allowed in in

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.200
the first place well you know what was

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.720
happening they were going and getting

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.919
the surgeries they would just sign up

00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:21.919
for the reserves and you're like now i

00:21:21.919 --> 00:21:23.679
can trans the government's paying for it

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:25.760

some people say that but it's like look

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.480
i feel like that's a good move

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.640
going against or allowing [ __ ] but

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.400
only in the coast guard

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.960
just having just a trans coast guard uh

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.960

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.960
if they join the if this thing goes away

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.640
it's going if they join the coast guard

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.280
and it's exclusively trans coast guard

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.880
they may evolve they'll be out there

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.640

john mccain is a [ __ ] good politician

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:14.799

he thinks he thinks well there's this

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.799
thing i've seen a lot online where it's

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:21.279

that's what they keep saying

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.080
which would make it

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:30.960
you know

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.799
three times as deadly as the um the

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:34.080
holocaust

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.600
is what they think we're about to do so

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.640
they're trying to say people are going

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.720
to die in the next 20 years i i'm not

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.799

dead by the time this thing gets

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.720

that everybody doesn't have healthcare

00:32:58.159 --> 00:32:59.600
well it's yeah there should be

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.799
healthcare there should be at least

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:02.720
there should be a bottom health care

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.399
also [ __ ] can just go to actually i

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.440
guess there is

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.279
everyone does have healthcare that's the

00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:10.000
thing you can go to an emergency room

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.279

they probably have hammers dude oh yeah

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.839

00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:11.680
their whole life yeah they just had this

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.240

no way i'm not getting [ __ ] with this

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.680

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.320

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.640
or in the er dude go down there head

started beating off the ants on him and

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:42.720

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.520
dude being an offensive lineman that's

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.880

that is sick yeah i love that and it

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.000

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.040
system we ran the wing t did you really

that's true um but i mean that's the

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.800
whole thing was like there and again i

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.480
don't know how accurate it is but it was

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.880
like you joined the reserves

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.640
now the u.s military has to cover all

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.960
these [ __ ] surgeries which you know

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.480
in the defense budget it's what is it

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.720
trillions of dollars because yeah but

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.480
still a cosmetic surgery should not be

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.079
part of this exactly that shouldn't and

00:49:06.079 --> 00:49:07.680
it's like

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.280
i mean i'm just totally guessing but

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.480
there there's guys who are like dude

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.760
we're dealing with life-and-death

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.520
decisions we don't have time we don't

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.160
have time [ __ ] [ __ ] also i get it

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.440
you're upset you know what was really

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.280
annoying was when this whole thing

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.720
happened everybody started citing the

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.960
defense budget like how much people how

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.800
much transgender would cost the defense

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.640
budget yeah versus how much they spend

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.119
on viagra a year

00:49:29.119 --> 00:49:31.599
and it was like they spent 84 million a

00:49:31.599 --> 00:49:33.440
year on viagra

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.000
yeah i was like yeah because

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.520
we're creating

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.520
a generation not a generation we're

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.400
creating

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.599
thousands

00:49:41.599 --> 00:49:44.240
of men with ptsd yeah who are coming

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.800
back to america and they're trying to

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.200
get their life back yeah it's like just

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.119
because it's funny because it's viagra

00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:52.960
and it's boners it sounds like a

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.240
frivolous cost yeah but it's actually to

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.280
try to maintain this guy's somewhat

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.760
just some sort of return to normalcy for

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.440
these [ __ ] guys yeah and they're like

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.000
why are we spending any money on viagra

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.960
it's like so this guy can [ __ ] his wife

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.359
well also so this guy can [ __ ] a [ __ ]

00:50:11.359 --> 00:50:13.280
who cares so this guy can [ __ ] again let

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.000
him [ __ ] and you don't think

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.559
you're transgender [ __ ] sergeant

00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:20.559
who's taking a ton of female hormones

00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:22.400
doesn't need viagra either the [ __ ]

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.839
boys are putting down a bunch of those

00:50:23.839 --> 00:50:25.599
blue pills dude they're snorting them

00:50:25.599 --> 00:50:26.640
yeah

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.839
so it's like

00:50:27.839 --> 00:50:29.200
they're the [ __ ] troops are like well

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.480
actually we kind of need those things

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.240
because i take a ton of exercise this

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.400
doesn't get hard anymore well it's i

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.280
can't believe that that the number was

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.359
one to six thousand

00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:40.960
what is that what you said about number

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.880
of transgenders in them said there was

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.119
either one thousand or it was yeah one

00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:47.599
to six thousand that's [ __ ] absurd

00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:49.200
transgender troops

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.280
that's an absurd number you're saying

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.839
it's way more than i thought

00:50:52.839 --> 00:50:54.720
yeah no that's a really low number i

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.200
mean a thousand people in america is

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.319
crazy yeah crazy low small town we have

00:51:00.319 --> 00:51:02.319
that that's our listenership yeah it's

00:51:02.319 --> 00:51:04.079

00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:06.400
[ __ ] t-bots our listenership we all

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.319
do here's here's a good stat we have

00:51:08.319 --> 00:51:11.040
more listeners than transgenders in the

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.359
military yeah let's just say that that's

00:51:13.359 --> 00:51:15.520
pretty sick that's absurd

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.520
we are not paying for you guys to trans

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.119

guys

00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:49.520
i was just laughing about this with

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.280
somebody that was like they chose

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.520

they are yeah

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.319

only men search for like big dick girls

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.240
don't search for it

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.520
that's because you want to see the lady

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.280
getting hurt i know but it's just funny

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.599
that like it is something that like

00:52:27.599 --> 00:52:29.119

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.680
angry transgenders coming at you

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.440
dude i guarantee that transgenders are

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.280
ruthless oh they're probably [ __ ]

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.559
brutal that's another thing look at the

00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:16.480
taste of that power dude this is this is

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.480
gonna be a very not on my watch i'm

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.559
probably gonna one day regret this

00:53:20.559 --> 00:53:21.760
what but

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.040
there's another reason you don't want

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.640
people that are transgendered in the

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.160
military is

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.640
perhaps we haven't because being trans

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.480
is pretty new

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.760
yeah it's a relatively new thing

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.800
i don't think we have a full

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.880
understanding of the mental stability of

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.559
somebody who's

00:53:38.559 --> 00:53:41.680
a transgender person yeah

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.200
maybe we shouldn't be tossing them in

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.720
there in the military with a group of

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.559
people that are already

00:53:46.559 --> 00:53:48.480
under scrutiny for mental

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.160
stability yeah and it's a chicken and

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.520
egg thing so like because you can go to

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.200
the suicide rate for trans people's

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.839
[ __ ] like super high oh yeah because

00:53:55.839 --> 00:53:56.720
you're

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.400
but yeah you can be like well always

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.000
confused your entire life yeah

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.240
criticizing you your entire life exactly

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.559
you're probably kind of [ __ ] dumb

00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:05.110
yeah

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:06.640
[Laughter]

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:07.839
but it's like dude yeah then you're

00:54:07.839 --> 00:54:10.000
gonna be like all right here's an ar-15

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.920

00:56:32.079 --> 00:56:33.520
empathy

like what the [ __ ] dude if i'm you used

00:56:45.599 --> 00:56:47.359
to be in a [ __ ] tent and people would

00:56:47.359 --> 00:56:50.319
pay a nickel to see

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.720
the boardwalk dude that was a thing that

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:53.920
was a real thing

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.480
a mustache lady it was it was a freak

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.839
it was freaky

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.040
that's actually incredibly uh hateful

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.680
but uh but it is however there's a grain

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.960
of truth in there that everybody

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.640
listening to this is kind of like well

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.559
that's true i go to whole foods a lot i

00:57:12.559 --> 00:57:14.400
can't get gay i can't beat you yeah you

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.240
should be barred from the military

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.240
good barbecue

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.839
i chance i have trans i mean you're

00:57:19.839 --> 00:57:21.040
gluten-free

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.200
you're out of the military

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.119
you can't go dude

00:57:25.119 --> 00:57:26.880
if i'm in line at whole foods

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.359
it's always like it's just like a i saw

00:57:29.359 --> 00:57:32.079
a dude like a chubby dude in a tube top

00:57:32.079 --> 00:57:33.920
and i there i'm like i'm at whole foods

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.720
i did this to myself

00:57:37.839 --> 00:57:38.880
i mean whole foods i'm like all right

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.319
there's a chubby guy at the tube top and

00:57:40.319 --> 00:57:41.520
like daisy duke shorts and his butt

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.359
cheeks hanging out i didn't have to come

00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:45.200
here i did it to myself but i'm in

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.599
[ __ ] like fallujah in a foxhole and i

00:57:47.599 --> 00:57:48.720
see you training next to me i'm just

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.640
gonna like

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.720
goddammit

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:53.839
i don't think they should be here right

00:57:53.839 --> 00:57:54.480
now

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.839
yeah there's a time and a place for

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:56.960
everything is what i'm trying to say

00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.799
yeah well here's the thing people get in

00:57:58.799 --> 00:58:00.480
their mind not saying you're wrong to

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.799
use those examples of like

00:58:02.799 --> 00:58:05.280
we're gonna be in combat or in a foxhole

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.720
yeah nobody's in a [ __ ] foxhole

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.440
anymore okay really yeah that no

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.720
transgender person is going to be in a

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.960
foxhole yeah the problem is is even

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.799
having them

00:58:14.799 --> 00:58:17.440
on base or

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.400
around or in a [ __ ] unit yeah that's

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.240
not in combat or anything i mean there's

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.839
going to be an issue

00:58:23.839 --> 00:58:25.440
well plus with all this it's not their

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.440
fault necessarily no

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.799
but it kind of is they're kind of

00:58:28.799 --> 00:58:31.040
imposing themselves on the situation but

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.160
also

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.400
uh it's just going to be it's not

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.200
there's

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.359
this isn't a [ __ ] company

00:58:37.359 --> 00:58:39.440
yes you know what i mean this is an ibm

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.760
where it's like well money's too

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.599
important for us to care about this

00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:45.200
situation yeah this is the [ __ ]

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.920
military yeah where it's like oh yeah we

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.160
we are literally the world's police we

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.960
control everything we don't have

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.119
the resources the time to be worried

00:58:55.119 --> 00:58:58.799
about feelings of our own soldiers

00:58:58.799 --> 00:59:00.240
that are totally unnecessary like just

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.119
an unnecessary drama added to this thing

00:59:03.119 --> 00:59:04.400
of course and it's just if you're out on

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.000

bumping into each other jesus christ and

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.199
then uh

01:26:23.199 --> 01:26:24.639
it would burn people out the

01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:26.320
confederates started burning people out

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.360
because it was in the summer and they

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.040
would burn they'd just burn the woods

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.639

out of the way but

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.360
