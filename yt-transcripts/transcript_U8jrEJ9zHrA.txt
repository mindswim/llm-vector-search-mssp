00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.730
time of crisis like don't worry that we

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.440
are still the strongest military in the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.110
world yeah check out these planes yeah

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.940
weird it's the old thing I think it's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.980
kind of a it's kind of an antiquated

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.980
show being like we're gonna fly military

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.610
planes over your city today it's [ __ ]

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.320

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.440
here comes a [ __ ] stealth bomber over

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.709
the stadium let's go it's such a cheap

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.170
trick to like boost morale and [ __ ]

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.239

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.850
was a stealth bomber like flying around

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.160
they should drop like one little bomb

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.560
they see I think it's 22 to have a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.120
bomber like that like just one dude in

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.860
the plane looking at like 80,000 people

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.900
in a stadium like I could kill all you

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.769
guys are probably just so you know just

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.660
let the hatch down to set dude it'd be

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.450
funny they drop like water balloons they

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.300

never live like this ever dude how about

00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:14.300
the [ __ ] numbers dude the numbers

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.960
were getting spiked by probable cases

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.300
yeah that's you can't been doing that

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.909
yeah that's crazy well no that was they

00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:24.860
they withheld the probable cases from

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.289
New York's body count I think a couple

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:28.580
weeks ago they added them and it added

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.630
like 4,000 deaths to be like yeah a

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.569
bunch of different doctors thought these

00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:38.329
people probably had Co vid which if

00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:39.709
you're running like a statistical

00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:42.319
analysis that's that's totally invalid

00:08:42.319 --> 00:08:44.949
to be like well how'd you guys determine

00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:47.510
[ __ ] coffee yeah it was like well he

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.519
died and you know we uh you know we

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:51.230
matched some symptoms up it's like you

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.790
can't you can't do that and count that

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.320
the official thing unless you a strict

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.580
and you're like these people

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.230
specifically thought they said hey I

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.170
just had a cynical both cynical thought

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.990
about all those nurses being like five

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.450
thousand people died in our hospital

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.140
like I was in the trenches it's like

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.650
yeah did they I'm sure they did yeah

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.360
or you mean target those tick tock

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.530
numbers up aren't they always die isn't

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.000
that why being an emergency room nurse

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.290
is horrible because people are

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.220
constantly dying in there every day yeah

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.480
yeah you can come in with like a [ __ ]

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.330
like their arm off yeah exactly

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.770
every day if someone comes in with like

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.760
a gnarly [ __ ] foot from a lawn mower

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.700
something crazy and dude I think we

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.770
definitely got hit with some sort of bug

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.830
but it's like why are they so intent on

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.170
these nodes in bio warfare Tim Poole had

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.850
me thinking what war with China is

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.030

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.730
really

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.650
first of all let's be real here this is

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.060
definitely we're not gonna actually

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.340
fight China and win anything

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.230
these are billionaires shuffling money

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.520
around and just having a bunch of people

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.290
die listen let's all let's set the

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.310
record straight we're not gonna like

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.900
Triomphe oh it's funny because I don't

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.100
know if anyone really believes in that

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.380
anymore like we gotta go look there's no

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.840
way we can go like invade try as soon as

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.890
you start invading them they're gonna be

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.960
nukes Newton newts nukes nukes

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.140
oh yeah bioweapons bioweapons Tim was

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.790
bringing he got it you gotta listen the

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.290
temple thing he's brings up some good

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.690
points but it is true that like any he

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.400
was talking about how historically any

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.610
time a world power gets challenged by

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.340
another world power there is a war like

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.740
the dominant force in the world which is

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.560
it's rare when it happens usually people

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.090
hold on to it kind of longer than we did

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.670
we we didn't even last so we lasted like

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.730
one century is number one yeah that's

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.500
true but I do know the Chinese are

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.250

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.380
if you obviously like they're saying

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.300
like if you get caught raping a kid like

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.870
you're you're in hot water you have sex

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.880
with child prostitutes who are underage

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.920
they're just like that's different

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.770
not a big it's not as like it's not as

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.750
big of a thing they're just kind of like

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.520
well yeah they were out there offering

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.460
their body to you so yeah paid so so if

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.830
you pay to have sex with a child not a

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.440
big deal if you just like you try to

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.940
poke him on them then you know they're

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.740
they're gonna you're gonna spank they're

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.770
gonna bust out you're good yeah that's a

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.540
loophole in China you can pay to have

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.190
sex have sex with a child and it's a way

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.260
lesser charge and it's not like they're

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.850
like you okay huh he's a bit of a party

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.240
animal and capitalism's running wild

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.990
over there yeah I don't I don't know I

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.910
think the prostitution has been there

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.740
forever even even within the Communist

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.950
Party yeah no I think this is more of

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.580
living in like a weird dictatorship

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.800
yeah they live in a wild dictatorship I

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.630
mean if they had any kind of vote people

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.630
like [ __ ] no you can't do that then

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.240
again I don't know who knows it's funny

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.260
that's the video that's the thing right

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.270
now he can they vote do they vote they

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.000
have to vote China just trying to have

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.660
like weird to like owner how they vote I

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.670
think Hong Kong can vote but I think

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.320
China the mainland China just squash

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.270
that I'm sure there's some sort of thing

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.060
face full ass hell I think they do have

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.360
eyes and again I'm not in Germany you

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.310

especially I believe was like one of the

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.909
first places in Philly to get code

00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:09.419

year olds you can get strokes from it

00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:19.890

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:25.350
is from a test dozens of cases have had

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.640

yeah and they're gonna tell me like 36

00:21:34.409 --> 00:21:37.020

00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:02.309
there was a twenty seven-year-old there

00:22:02.309 --> 00:22:05.309
like this 23 old grocery employee this

00:22:05.309 --> 00:22:07.890

was already on their way out

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.059
I cannot help but feel like there's a

00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:32.640
concentrated effort to make this as bad

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.620
as pop to make this seem as bad as

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.950
possible well that's like everything in

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.260
this country this has been you know

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.149
totally politicized and left or right

00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:43.889
the left wants this to be the worst

00:22:43.889 --> 00:22:46.710
thing ever the right wants to bring guns

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.010
out this is there's no such thing as

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:50.750
covin

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.070

about how when she fell how I use like

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.300

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.170
sounded like I heard a buffalo a guy

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.940

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:34.190
down that hill faceplate on a trail

now I gotta call her tell her you know I

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:41.090

being out here

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:49.940
that's a hard beef that's a tough beef

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.380
she was like accusing me of doing drugs

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.850
because she heard that I took one

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.980
seroquel Georgie you're taking

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.540
antipsychotics like I said I heard you

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.760
she was like I'm disappointed in you

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.620
she's like actually texted me saying how

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.190
she was disappointed at me texts and

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.660
then the next day we were arguing again

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.160

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.020
just mad at yourself right now you you

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.670

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:29.600
hill Jack and Joan well I think G's

some really days you're clumsy right now

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.870
I think it's the 5g I think it's Huawei

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.550
dude is making out dude it's so sick

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.580
that like five g's in retrograde it's

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.430
like I mean that's astrology for white

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:53.120
dudes is like you'd say yeah I think

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.830
people are tripping because five Jesus

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.570
you know that's what cause that's what

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.100
David Icke was saying it's not we don't

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.660
have coronavirus we have one feel dying

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.880
because of 5g is now like spreading

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.640
through our land yeah so yeah dude

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.320
that's that's nice like I think that's

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.570
laughable clearly it's our Wi-Fi is too

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.470
[ __ ] good we're talking about

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:13.790
check your bars right now three bars

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.210
exactly dude rest my case

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.110
yeah they're trying to there's a lot of

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.730
people saying the 5g is blocking people

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.150
but ya know they begin wild and I think

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:24.680
in England in Birmingham they [ __ ]

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.840
burn to a tower they were like burning

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.820
5g towers that's another thing too it's

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.230
totally reasonable that the [ __ ] is not

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.630
good for people I'm yeah of course it's

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:33.830
reasonable to be like maybe it's gonna

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.570
give us like brain cancer in a little

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.930
bit but yeah it's like it's not giving

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.020
people to the kovin to be I have the

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.150
because of I don't know how anything

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:45.770
works but I got a good feeling it's not

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.660
5g yeah I don't think so

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.710
I think it's I think it's something that

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:49.840
I escaped from the lab

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.080
China I think that's probably exactly

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.730
what happened I think it was something

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:56.740

they're insurance guys yeah they're like

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:40.750
well you know I don't want to I don't

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:41.890
want them to catch up on this so if

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.420
you're if you're an insurance guy I just

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.490
I call my boy he told me about this if

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:47.440
you're an insurance guy you can say

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.970
whatever the [ __ ] you want you can be

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:50.200
like this is the million dollar

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.000
retirement plan this is above all in

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.250
life you're working in it's like this

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:55.980
security issue if you work in like

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.570
securities you have to deal with the SEC

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.370
and if you make like false claims they

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.130
can come fraud you up

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.960
that's for as far as I know it so

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.430
basically you these insurance guys you

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.230
can probably get ahold of you how'd they

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:11.200
find your parents who the [ __ ] knows did

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.410
they probably add on 10 60 it's like

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:18.820
then and then and and then it's like you

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.210
want to make a million dollars and see

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.130

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.630
of do it's like they tie up as much

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.160
money as they possibly can and this

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.690

then they just give you they give you

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.710
one percent interest and then slowly

China and they're just like they came up

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.180
where it was like at one point I think

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.180
my dad bought a house and the interest

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.330
rate became so high that it wiped out

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:07.090
his like the intrud the way the mortgage

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.260
thing went the interest rates are so

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:09.550
high that like it you didn't really pay

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.200
any mortgage interest on your house and

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.280
they went through the dot-com bubble

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.050
where all their houses doubled and

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.880
tripled and then now like we're kind of

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.500
all we've slid into a big recession

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.850
we're locked in our houses by the

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:21.760
government due to a weird [ __ ] flu

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.470
that they can't really the numbers are

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:26.530
all fudged and you know we gotta wear

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.910
masks and sit outside and they can't see

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:29.290
their family users are losing their

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:30.910
[ __ ] minds these are the [ __ ] this is

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:32.980
this is truly the Geezer apocalypse

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.840
either either it's actually gonna kill

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.990
the geezers or distress is just gonna

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.100
you know it could crush them into

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.770
diamonds dude it could become a geezer

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:43.330
could become very powerful from this

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.520
they are powerful they're just slowly

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.460
losing their power they baby boomers in

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.380

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:48.640
mean I wouldn't love it it just would be

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.990
hilarious if one of these times one of

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:51.220
these protests where everybody broke

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.740
that's popped off it's like a minute I

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.150
mean that'd be a battle there'd be like

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:57.760
800 dudes first the police and then they

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.990
army be an actual battle I mean it dude

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:04.840
I'm telling you if if like if doctors

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.210
bathtubs fat dudes just getting picked

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.070
off by [ __ ] the National Guard's

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:11.290
dressed up like [ __ ] superheroes or

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:13.120
whatever the dress says he'll be fined

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:13.780
awesome

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:15.610
yeah but they would like absolutely slay

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:16.840
because the people who opposed them

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.230
never have guns so they're not talking I

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.700
mean the military would have to come if

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.260
they opt off

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:26.260
oh yeah if the ar-15 people like how

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.910
many people they get like four hundred

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:29.830
dudes were they aren't they that like a

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.350
state capital he could take the state

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:35.410
capital for a year they need to hold out

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:36.220
for like a year

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.280
did you see extraction no dude

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.900
extraction on Netflix is [ __ ] sick

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.600
but at one point he's uh he's in and it

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:44.860
was just so funny when those you see

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.090
those military movies were they just

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.740
like get out of the way and they just

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.450
drive through the streets of India like

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:50.710
run through people's mark every time

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.450
they'd be hits into somebody's house the

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:54.940
family never reacts or just like they

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.160
just sit there on the couch oh people

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.260
are kicking in our doors Ian but at one

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.060
point he goes out of a window and is

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:04.570
going oh it's just pure Mandalay Bay

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:06.750
dude is just lighting up the Indian

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:09.280
soldiers he's trying to extract the

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.450
stood out in the police obviously right

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:12.850
on it so it's like what show is this

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:14.800
extract structure was like a comedy with

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.700
my judge it's extract my uncle it was

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.350
like you see extraction I'm like what

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:21.220
the mic judge

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.420
like now it's an action movie it's the

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:26.349
dude uh it's Thor he plays and he just

00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:27.760
did a Netflix movie where he just

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.130
basically blood [ __ ] India for like two

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:34.020
hours dude just shoots all their cops

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.690
like all he does fly by I know I always

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.220
go back to this obviously but the fact

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.780
that you like we got trouble for like

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.609
joking on a podcast and then Hollywood

00:44:42.609 --> 00:44:45.099
literally makes full movies of them just

00:44:45.099 --> 00:44:47.700
murdering people

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.950
Thor kills Indians for two hours two

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:53.380
hours are these lights up in ears like

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.720
this it's funny how bad that actually is

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.240
it is it's like pissed if I saw that

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.220
movie if I was a [ __ ] dude if some

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:04.810
Indians like had a big hit right now we

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:09.160
just killed it a hundred Americans like

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.650
mad about it if I was what the [ __ ] is

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:14.109
this we're gonna get a war with them

00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:16.359
it's funny too because in the movie that

00:45:16.359 --> 00:45:17.950
guy is just a mercenary who like gets

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:19.660
paid he's like an ex-military guy like

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.160
oh if you need me to go get somebody on

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.170
a season I could see his attitude in

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:24.849
this movie right now he's Australian

00:45:24.849 --> 00:45:26.910
action would I have to do I'll do it

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:29.500
it's all dude the movie is exciting I

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.119
got sucked in are like this is great but

00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:32.710
if you have you have dog brains when it

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:35.230
comes ideals it's every little gray it's

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:38.170
every cliche like the part in the action

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:39.310
movie where he takes off his shirt and

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:40.990
the guy like sees his scars and bullet

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.300
holes is like wow that's in there it's

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.160

surmise like oh he's got a dead son told

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.109
you the old school turns out his son was

00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.470
gay

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:07.150
his son kidnapped his dead so he dreams

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:09.460
about the better days okay dude yeah

down a helicopter one point it's like

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:29.800
what the [ __ ] I was watching I mean it's

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.119
just the Indian army that they're

00:46:31.119 --> 00:46:32.770

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:00.220
understand

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:02.140
well I think she wanted to say you want

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.340
to get away from the baby because I

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:04.390
think the baby should smell of breast

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:05.980
milk and it wakes him up but even like

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.380
we're both in bed and I'll get in a

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.120

so yeah they can smell it so you gotta

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:22.390
kind of get a little bit away from like

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:24.160
if I'm trying to give her a bottle she

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.540
has to go to the third floors the baby

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.190
will smell them smell her and just be

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:29.680

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.090
real deal this ain't the same when I

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:33.100
came this aint it's Brooke she actually

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.420

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:35.770
saying cuz I was like they have to make

00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:38.410
a apparently it's a big deal getting

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:39.850
your baby to drink out of a bottle and

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:42.880
look at the nipples on my dude why can't

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.400
they make one that looks exactly like a

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.980
female like a woman's nipple rather than

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.680
this weird like oblong shaving because

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.780
it would be off-putting I baby I'll do

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.580
they they wanted covered full of like

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:55.930

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.010

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:31.890
Michael Jordan's dad dying tune in now

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:35.370
yeah yeah who really did it yeah that'll

00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:36.810
come they say the F word on it which is

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:39.480
surprising who says doors on ESPN

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.600
what aired on ESPN and they're dropping

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.490
f-bombs I'm excited about that I'm happy

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:46.230
about that we're moving in the right

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:47.820
direction there that's pretty as a

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:51.090
society so it they're having that's a

00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:52.160
Disney Channel

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:55.610
Wow it is me dropping f-bombs on on

00:54:55.610 --> 00:55:00.600
national TV that's pretty weird that's

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.580
pretty weird and it's Netflix Elmo was

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.920
Obama's in it Obama it has some quote

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.660
Obama and Bill Clinton are both in it

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:08.910
wait so this is Netflix or ESPN it's

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:10.040
both

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.260
okay we're dead maybe maybe Disney's but

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.670

yes and they know it's it's ESPN it's on

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:25.140
ESPN it's presented by ESPN and Netflix

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.339
I'm sure it'll just go straight to

00:55:26.339 --> 00:55:30.740
Netflix once it's done airing on ESPN

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:34.020
Obama yeah he like owns Netflix and I'm

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:36.089
sure bill bills involves somehow with

00:55:36.089 --> 00:55:40.109
Disney or because ABC ESPN

00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:43.710
they're both Disney yeah Netflix will

00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:48.839
probably be Disney shortly did did we

00:55:48.839 --> 00:55:50.790
just live in a company this is a

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:54.119
corporation we live in Disney this it's

00:55:54.119 --> 00:55:55.380
gonna be trying to dude they're gonna

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.359

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:04.920
well if we and maybe being trying to use

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.060

I mean agent consent law will drop

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.109
fourteen fourteen forty twenty two could

00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:14.609
be willing that I'd be willing to

00:56:14.609 --> 00:56:18.570
sacrifice a lot of freedoms so dude

00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:20.550
right now in China is a bachelor you

00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:22.140
could just adopt fourteen year old girls

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:25.920
and nobody would bat an eye you give

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.000
their I'm a bachelor and I have a

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.710
passion for raising fourteen-year-old

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:30.450
girls that's and that's like another

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:31.910
loophole for like having like a

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:35.210
indentured sex serve it in your house

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:40.349
and you get did I'm reading it in the

00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:44.160
what is it the economist Wow

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.690
condiments and The Economist is pretty

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:46.890
like you know they're easygoing they're

00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:48.510
not they're not like right-wing yeah

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:50.220
they're not trying to prove anybody now

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:51.750
they're gonna be like I'm sure they are

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:53.010
I don't know I don't know anything I

00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:55.220
don't know who's biased and who's not

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:58.680
other than the obvious ones yeah now the

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.390
economists is just kind of like I don't

00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:02.040
they're not like I mean they just had a

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.540
feature on Bill Gates being like we

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.770
invited Bill Gates to tell us why we

00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:06.630
need vaccines dude I'm starting to like

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:08.640
Bill Gates what do you like about I

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.560
don't know I liked it everyone's turning

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.880
on him I think it's funny that's pretty

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.380
tightly I can respect I kind of support

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:15.390
I respect that move big time

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:17.819
did you like actually guys everyone's

00:57:17.819 --> 00:57:19.020
like oh he's trying to he's trying to

00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.250
kill everybody you know what it's like

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:22.380
now dude Bill Gates is the man you're a

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.329
hater you know what's weird so it's like

00:57:24.329 --> 00:57:26.490
say goes again the idea that he's like a

00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:28.290
super villain just hell-bent on death

00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:29.940
the direction yeah I'm sad I don't I

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:30.360
don't

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.760
to that but what's weird is say you're

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.290
as rich as Bill Gates and you have a

00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:36.000
weird phobia of like say this guy has

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.600
like a crazy phobia of germs and viruses

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.490
yeah and then rather than like you

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:42.960
eventually hitting like if I'm like OCD

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.370

crazy [ __ ] will be stopped by the world

00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:50.880
because I you know I only have so much

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.710
control and influence but if you're a

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:55.320
control freak with unlimited power and

00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.750
control you could spin the whole world

00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:59.160
into your weird little neurotic

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.630
nightmare where he's like going in

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:03.480

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.520
people here hell-bent on doing this and

00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:07.590
it could be real it could be this guy's

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:09.750
just a [ __ ] nut and has a bunch of

00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:11.310

sure no 100% you stopped and when it was

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:02.760
at its shittiest when when you me that

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.800
was literally did time stand-up sucks

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.810
the most was when you me had totally

01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:08.790
outgrown the scene we were in and just

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.440
we were doing the same thing every

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.800
single day do three minutes around

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.570
people that talk [ __ ] on us every day

01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:17.160
wasn't even that dude these were the

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.510
people the thing that bothered me oh

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:19.980
yeah that [ __ ] blows I'm not gonna

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.840
say that wasn't that definitely was but

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.190
the thing that killed me was like I

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:25.530
would go like when I would go to helium

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:26.760
and I'd be with like a headliner I know

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.290
this guy's making like 10 15 G's a

01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:30.150
weekend you know sometimes some dudes

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:32.160
are making probably like 20 and they

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.359
would just be [ __ ] miserable

01:01:33.359 --> 01:01:35.880
so I'm like dude what's the [ __ ]

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.859
disconnect here there just be like the

01:01:37.859 --> 01:01:39.270
complaining and then you get the feature

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:42.570
being like well I know this person and

01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:44.850
like that whole like upward gaze of like

01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:46.200
nothing's ever good enough for me

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.570
sucking dick blood dogging I was I

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:50.190
[ __ ] had enough of it I had a [ __ ]

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:52.170
enough of it that's why I got this

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.180
illusion that's that's right that's

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.290
right to feel that way especially

01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:57.630
because there was really no

01:01:57.630 --> 01:02:00.509
upward mobility for us in Philly like

01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:04.640
yeah I was occasionally featuring yeah

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.630
like I wasn't gonna headline there

01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:08.430
unless I'd [ __ ] moved to New York so

01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:11.880
we both hit a ceiling that was the worst

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.470

01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:15.329

01:02:15.329 --> 01:02:17.910
hack come in and complain for it's like

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:20.009
well then yeah what's the point but the

01:02:20.009 --> 01:02:22.259
point is now cuz those guys don't have

01:02:22.259 --> 01:02:25.259
hands bro this is true but now we have

01:02:25.259 --> 01:02:29.009
fans now we can bring our own friends to

01:02:29.009 --> 01:02:30.869
open for us and come with us

01:02:30.869 --> 01:02:33.000

minute like the shit's a sick is it I

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:44.280
mean it's sick if you're sick but most

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.720
of the people I met doing stand-up who

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.650
do it at a high level

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:49.109
I don't like I didn't like who I worked

01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:51.809
for I'll say worked with I didn't like

01:04:51.809 --> 01:04:54.270
yeah I think that's fair most of them

01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:58.740
are pretty dude corny yeah but think of

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:03.180
our group I like all those guys like

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.369
every every for real every one of those

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:07.230
West Coast comics we're talking about I

01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:08.550
that I've met I have liked

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:11.309
mm-hmm they've all been pretty cool but

01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:12.720
I mean you know if I was making millions

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.690
I'd be I'd imagine pretty cool yeah but

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:16.920
they were all cool man they were on the

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.690
price so that's not a wage war I'm

01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:20.280
trying to wage war we are gonna wait I

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.780
mean there is the war is waged good now

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.520
we do it well just kids will get soda in

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:30.480
jaén yep we'll tag them in Schultz will

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:34.319
get salty in it East Coast what is going

01:05:34.319 --> 01:05:36.599
on well go content for content they will

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.339
put them up well there's what the people

01:05:38.339 --> 01:05:39.299
decide it's no big deal

01:05:39.299 --> 01:05:40.859
I think but see that's the thing the the

01:05:40.859 --> 01:05:42.119
argument is gonna be that the people

01:05:42.119 --> 01:05:44.099
have decided and there are millions

01:05:44.099 --> 01:05:46.890
millions of dollars and views are is the

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:48.750
market yeah but that was due to a lot of

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:50.430
structure that was due to a lot of

01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:53.069
structure that was in place I hear you

01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:56.700
so yeah shift I think it shifted I don't

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.020
know if dude we shouldn't be on the air

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.240
right not even the money thing is on Zoo

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.309
this is not son zoo of us do we need to

01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:03.960
[ __ ] hold our tongues until the time

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.880
is right to a tab I can't be announcing

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.130
a war what do you know maybe this is a

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:12.030
PSYOP dude yeah that was what bothered

01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:13.470
me I realized that was a bother man just

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.299
like seeing people who were doing a

01:06:15.299 --> 01:06:17.309
thing getting paid tons of money and it

01:06:17.309 --> 01:06:18.540
was [ __ ] miserable just being like

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:20.099
dude what what the thing I'm not saying

01:06:20.099 --> 01:06:21.720
that's you know I don't think that's the

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.670
West Coast milieu I just think that's

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:24.410
the

01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:27.350
yeah that's showbiz bro that's for me

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:28.790

the way this start out is so there

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.540

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:54.830
it definitely but I mean definitely

01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:56.420
secure the bag with Netflix but it's

01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.870
like yeah you can put usually you could

01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:01.940
secure the bag like Louie yeah I just

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:04.010
released it on his own I think yeah I

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.239
think that's the way things are kind of

01:11:05.239 --> 01:11:08.660
going dude I I do think that's the the

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:11.120
eventual well especially when you have a

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.640
name already like him yeah exactly like

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.640
I couldn't do that that wouldn't help me

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.489
yeah well yeah yeah I need exposure

01:11:19.489 --> 01:11:22.130
before I can start releasing [ __ ] on my

01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:24.290
own yeah you could secure a little bag

01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:26.660
you used to quarter secured small bag

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.719
it's curious to a school bag but yeah

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:30.680
probably should

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.090
ya know think about I could definitely

01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:34.820
secure a small bag or a small bag then

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:36.949
it's laces yeah one of the things I

01:11:36.949 --> 01:11:38.510
already got went out of my belt you guys

01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:40.010
want and then once I secured the small

01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:41.449
bag just immediately put it on YouTube

01:11:41.449 --> 01:11:46.910
for free I mean we're not gonna have

01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:48.110
money soon none of us don't have money

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:49.460
anyway pretty soon so might as well just

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:50.840
get used to just doing stuff and just

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.100
put it on YouTube and it's big damn I

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:55.160
got a lot of use make nice until they

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.810
get rid of views and clicks and likes

01:11:56.810 --> 01:12:03.380
and [ __ ] [ __ ] then what I don't think

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.900
any I think things are good dude I think

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.180
we're getting absolutely sy out by China

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:09.890
internally to where people are now

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:11.300
looking at me like you don't have a face

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:12.830
mask oh you don't want them tracking

01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:14.180
your phone what's wrong with you it's

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:16.699
like bro is this chat is this [ __ ] I

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:17.960
told it's my mother-in-law yesterday I'm

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.030
like this isn't [ __ ] China dude I'm

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:22.430
not wearing goddamn face mask what your

01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:28.699
mother-in-law sir oh you stop it Saint

01:12:28.699 --> 01:12:31.420
goddamn china bruh

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:34.790
Tony I'm telling you bro have you not

01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:38.240
telling me anything I've heard this

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.950
there or I knew this was going to happen

01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:40.910
there already

01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:42.980
virtually the new virtue signal now is

01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.210
like who what you don't want them to

01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:46.340
have all your phone data and location at

01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:48.140
any given time and be able to sing early

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.480
pull you out of a pool of data okay

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.020
that's like what what what it's like

01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:56.090
check it follows your movement so like

01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:57.350
if you leave the city you have to come

01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:59.390
back in and get tested like [ __ ] like

01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:01.460
that they're gonna have that there's

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.680
gonna be a mandatory vaccine for kovat

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.210
and then apparently the new vaccine

01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:07.160
isn't even like you know give a weakened

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.630
version of it it's like some genetic

01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:12.290
manipulation [ __ ] they send in a thing

01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:15.170
that kind of like tweaks the genome

01:13:15.170 --> 01:13:17.450
sequence to make you immune to it I

01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:19.220
guess I don't even [ __ ] know I don't

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.810
think anybody knows anything you know

01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:22.790
and Bill Gates is on record saying that

01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:26.210
he has given tracers to people so he's

01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:27.380
like yeah I mean they're tracers if

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:28.700
you're sick we inject you with a thing

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:29.990
that kind of tracks tracks where you're

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:32.840
at but you know we can only like see

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.250
where you're at if we're really close to

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:35.450
you we don't have the technology like

01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:36.590
see where you have far away it's like

01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:38.630
bro I can see the [ __ ] road in Cairo

01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:41.180
right now you're telling me you're gonna

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.950
hit me with a tracer we're like you can

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:44.540

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:46.610
[ __ ] out of here man why is he trying to

01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:48.080
see where people are at this is the [ __ ]

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.320
I don't know I'm just like what is this

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.150
dude it's a turn it's a turnkey tyranny

01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:55.160
bro they can all they got to do is turn

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.130
the key bro we're fully locked down or

01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:59.720

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.010

01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:04.400

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:10.010
over there yeah yeah true I'm not trying

01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:11.360
to rile them up I'm saying but that is

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.390
quite the deterrent like you have a

01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:17.090
country we have an army of [ __ ]

01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:19.640

01:14:27.650 --> 01:14:29.180
of stopping them if they get all those

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.950
