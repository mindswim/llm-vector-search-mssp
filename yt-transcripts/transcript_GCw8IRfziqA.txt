00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.519
it's liquid iv with one stick of liquid

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.920
iv in 16 ounces of water you get two to

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.840
three times the amount of hydration is

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.800
plain water

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.920
this is a game changer for me after golf

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.120
after shows waking up hungover

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.799

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.879

orange and as much potassium as a banana

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.560

uh well uh i

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.799
only made it two semesters into college

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:35.840
and that wasn't working out

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.919
to be quite honest when you named your

00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:39.440

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.520
what transgender was

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.359
so i thought she was a hermaphrodite at

00:44:17.359 --> 00:44:18.880
first i was like you had both the whole

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.839

if she had both would you want to see it

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.680
thing

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.599
they refuse to look at it but if they

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:37.040
have both things

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.720

swastikas drawn on my car in high school

01:00:02.319 --> 01:00:03.440

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.920

from the first episode here in austin

01:04:25.839 --> 01:04:27.150
five weeks ago

01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:28.400
[Music]

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.720
brand new stand-up comedian but i

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.960
absolutely loved his uh

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.280
his style and his [ __ ] look and

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.280
delivery and i wanted to see him write a

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.960
new minute and come back and do it again

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.480
so i told him a month ago

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:42.400
that in a month he can come back and

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.760
have an automatic spot

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.839
it's been a month this is his new minute

01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:47.440
he's waited a month for this

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:51.359
how loud can this place get for j.p

01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:55.839
hinsdale everyone

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:03.550
[Music]

01:05:05.599 --> 01:05:08.480
when i was eight years old my mom's

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.720
fiance took me and his son

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.520
to go ride horses at his uh friend's

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.319
ranch

01:05:14.319 --> 01:05:18.160
and the first thing my mom's fiance son

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.920
did when we got on the horses was

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.960
slap my horse on the ass so my horse

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.799
takes off running right

01:05:24.799 --> 01:05:27.760
and pretty it becomes pretty clear soon

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.240
that the straps that hold the saddle on

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:33.680
are loose so slowly but surely i start

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.039
to spin

01:05:35.039 --> 01:05:38.799
underneath the horse as it is running

01:05:38.799 --> 01:05:42.240
yeah if that wasn't bad enough

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.480
and if i wasn't scared enough all of a

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.760
sudden i started to feel something

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.839
poking me in the back of the head like

01:05:48.839 --> 01:05:51.839
this

01:05:52.079 --> 01:05:54.160
yeah if uh if you're not falling if you

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.599
don't i don't know

01:05:55.599 --> 01:05:59.119
you pretty much tell what's going on

01:05:59.359 --> 01:06:01.760
basically the friction of an

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:02.960
eight-year-old boy

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.240
rubbing underneath a horse made him feel

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:06.880
something

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.240
and yeah i wish i could tell you that

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.160
the ranch owner got to me before the

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.240
horse finished

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:19.839
i really wish i could tell you that

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.880
a microphone over his head at one point

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.079
to uh

01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:25.839
he's getting down to pick up his inhaler

01:06:25.839 --> 01:06:27.920
he took a knee a lot of comedians

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.680
dropped the mic after they're said he

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.680
dropped his inhaler before his set

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.319
very rare in the comedy world do we see

01:06:34.319 --> 01:06:34.880
that

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.640
jp i'm guessing that's a true story

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.240
because it has to be

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:41.680
yes um anytime anybody says gamey

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.799
i remember the smell of horse come

01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:47.520
yeah wow and i figured where did it

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.520
where did it end up coming

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:53.520
um pretty much all over me wow

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.119
did you return the favor did you come

01:06:55.119 --> 01:06:57.359
back on the horse no i was locked in the

01:06:57.359 --> 01:06:58.160
you know cause

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.799
look i'm in lh i'm from la i was wearing

01:07:00.799 --> 01:07:01.839
la gears and

01:07:01.839 --> 01:07:03.280
you know people that ride horses know

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.480
that you're supposed to wear cowboy

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.200
boots

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.200
so the minute i had those shoes in i was

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.359
pretty much locked into the saddle

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:12.000
so i just had to wait until he was

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:12.400
finished

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.000
i don't think you're ever really locked

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
into anything well

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.039

responses have you ever heard somebody

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.880
from la wearing la gear like that's a

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.599

just went straight underneath

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.960
yeah while i was running and then he

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.960

so you

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.200

when you were a uh when you're on a

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.960

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.039

01:08:22.159 --> 01:08:24.400
there was a lack of equine erotica so i

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.440

it's hard to do this is not an easy show

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.760
to do 60 seconds you have to get them

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:06.080
quick and keep them and hit them a lot

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.280
uh and uh you have to basically do what

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.719
the horse did to you

01:10:10.719 --> 01:10:14.000

01:11:41.199 --> 01:11:43.199
everything that happened right but

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:44.560
things got pretty [ __ ]

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:48.000
yeah so basically what happened was my

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.840
mom was seeing this one guy

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.000
and he was kind of like i don't know i

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.360
explained him he was like the money guy

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.440
for his organization

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.840
and my mom kind of like became his like

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.040
i don't know what you call it like crime

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.159
life or whatever

01:12:00.159 --> 01:12:03.840
like he had horror yeah

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.760
yeah the word you're looking for now is

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.040
yeah

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.640
i like prime life it makes her sound

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.640
classier no that's fine

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:13.920
i've heard worse face the audience okay

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:17.360
okay sorry uh

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:20.719
so basically what happened was um

01:12:20.719 --> 01:12:22.560
she was so she was with this guy and he

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.239
had a lot of yeah he was like the money

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:25.679
guy for his organization

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:28.480
he heard this part jp come on i'm sorry

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.880
i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry anyways

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.719
so after a while she's like no i want to

01:12:32.719 --> 01:12:34.880
be your your wife for real

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.520
but he had a wife right so that wasn't

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.360
gonna happen so she started dating this

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.640
other dude that stole

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:43.280
weed out of a food truck oh [ __ ] sounds

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.280
like your type of dream dad

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.080
yeah so so she started doing whatever

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.480
the early 90s version of ghosting is and

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.560
she was hanging out with this guy

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.679
and um it was called ghosting then too

01:12:55.679 --> 01:12:57.120
except when people said it they thought

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.280
of demi moore and patrick swayze yeah

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.880
so she's seeing this guy and

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.560
apparently the first thing people would

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.480
drug money do is buy a shitload of

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.239
parrots

01:13:08.239 --> 01:13:11.199
yeah okay so it wasn't an aviary but he

01:13:11.199 --> 01:13:12.000
just had a

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.199
he had 20 [ __ ] parrots who the [ __ ]

01:13:15.199 --> 01:13:16.000

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.920
jesus how many of those parrots came on

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.840
you none of them came on me but it gets

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:20.640
worse

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.719
it does just you didn't see the old

01:13:22.719 --> 01:13:24.000
[ __ ] parrot carrot

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.600
no but this is this is what happened so

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.120
my mom wanted to go out with this guy

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.880
one night and leave me at his house and

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.320

the guy thought it would

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.880
the guy thought i'd get over my fear of

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.880
birds if he taught all the parrots my

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.800

when i was 18 i lost my virginity not

trying to brag

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.920

a few weeks later she comes over she

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.239
think the baby's yours

01:34:42.239 --> 01:34:46.000
and instantly i was like [ __ ] i'm 18.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.600
i'm not a good sharer and all i eat is

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:50.880
hot pockets

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.080
i was like this baby's gonna have a

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.080
rough [ __ ] life

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:55.199
and then i thought about it i was like

01:34:55.199 --> 01:34:57.119
we didn't even finish having sex

01:34:57.119 --> 01:34:59.040
like my first time was terrible i grew

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.960
up religious i thought premarital

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:04.080
sex led to punishment so after a few

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.920
pumps i was like i pissed off god enough

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:08.719
and i just left

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.960
when i told her that she goes tony maybe

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:13.440
it was your pre-cum that got me pregnant

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.639
and i go my pre-cum and guys that's when

01:35:16.639 --> 01:35:17.600
i knew

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:21.119
i wasn't gonna like the kid

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:23.760
right like the idea of me creating life

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.360
without even feeling the pleasure of an

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.520
orgasm

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:30.400

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.960
to create a pre-come baby

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.320

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:37.520
here are there some pre-cum babies

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.119

blue after blue balls

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.480
