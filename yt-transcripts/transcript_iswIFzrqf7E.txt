00:21:28.529 --> 00:21:30.240
wrestle Shan and then we lay down next

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.090
else is burning in your world well right

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.669
now other than Caitlyn making out with

00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:45.899
my friend of my dream

00:21:45.899 --> 00:21:51.590

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.899
don't know yeah just you just woke up to

00:21:54.899 --> 00:21:58.049
scorn from astral betrayal I woke up mad

00:21:58.049 --> 00:22:00.360
and then I also woke up ten minutes late

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.799
I woke up at 10:10

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:04.950
and I had to move my Corolla out of my

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.200
to our part for the fat white trash my

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:07.950
videotape

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.050
she's the war

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.030
I called her a [ __ ] one time you

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.830
shouldn't have done that she listened

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.450
listeners go ahead

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.510
listeners this is how Matt McCusker

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.750
treats women imagine that he called a

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.690
woman who gave me a 76 the c-word

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:27.170
so what 150% I gave I was dropping off

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.720
my laundry too I'm a strong ally in the

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.300
Asian community to the lady who does the

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.590
Korean Jews that were washing her

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.480
clothes every call is not in continued

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.830
column I've never called them that you

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.300
wouldn't go to a crane business yeah

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.600
what this dude definitely would then why

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.030
do you call the Jews of Asia it's a term

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.700
of endearment oh it's a good thing yeah

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.610
sure you mean they're strong band they

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.740
you know the way you said it was like

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.720
they they're very sheisty that's just

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.630
through your [ __ ] just distorted

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.440
filter okay so you meant when you said

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.510
Koreans were the Jews I ever said don't

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.820
[ __ ] cut me off good when you said

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.790
Koreans are the Jews of Asia you meant

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.740
that in a good way if I ever said that

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.750
yes yes yes I would have meant that in a

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:12.110
good way

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.420
in a nice way say a lot of kick-ass

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.500
things I don't remember her because

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.500
because it sounded negative nah dude cuz

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.450
I was because I remember exactly when it

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.330
was it was after I had heard a gang of

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:29.660
Korean kids yeah and you were saying how

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.760
they probably I was like they treated me

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.680
like [ __ ] I was treated me like oh

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.540
you're the driver and just drive us yeah

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.560
and you're like oh they're probably

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.080
Korean dude what do you mean like

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.330
Koreans are like the Jews of Asia that's

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.160
how you said that doesn't sound like a

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.780
highly fictionalized account now I

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.580
probably don't fix my eyes that but I do

seeing like any you know part preferably

00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:03.200
male parking authority you know but you

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.059
know if I had to guess seeing like a

00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:06.260
parking authority guy like leaned

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.640
against the car giving it a ticket and

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.440

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.159
what makes it fun and the total lack of

00:27:49.159 --> 00:27:50.750

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.980
honestly they were like everyone team up

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.330
and everyone got partners and it was me

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:07.340

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.600
started I don't dude you just sit with a

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.890
girl it's just there's so many weird

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.810
elements it's like a you don't want to

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.580

were like her tits are touching me you

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.260

oh man what the [ __ ] so it's like this

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.830
it was just too bizarre for me I mean

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:37.970
that's a reality if tits are touching

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.740
you their tits they're touching you it's

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.420

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.820
points you're like oh yeah it's all a

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.560
[ __ ] wrestling and then I'm so

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.000
[ __ ] like whacked out about this that

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.710
she like bent my wrist up and she tapped

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.740
me out holy [ __ ] beat me the whole thing

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.470
so I was like [ __ ] pissed and then

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.150
the next time we went she's like look I

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.500
know you're taking it easy don't take it

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.730
easy on me that's really offensive

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.790
sounds like alright so we did that and

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.440
then like we got up square it off and I

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.910
grabbed the back of her heels and popped

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.380
him out from her and it's my [ __ ]

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.790
sweat the leg slapped her legs knocked

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:10.130
the wind out of her did you cry she was

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:14.770
just like she's like a great lady yeah

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.600
Ellie let's go sorry Jase what guys like

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.930
don't stop saying that I was like I

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:23.000
could kick your ass is that how you got

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.950
into that wrestling porn they're into I

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.020
was into that way before you were in a

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.750
Matt's in the extreme Ultimate Surrender

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.060
is in the lesbian wrestling and then the

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.650
loser [ __ ] the other one there gets

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:35.060
[ __ ] with the strapless yeah it never

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:35.990
makes sense to me

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:37.790
the loser gets [ __ ] maybe she isn't

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.470
that like kind of the point though she

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.340
gets to get [ __ ]

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.500
ya know I think it's a dominate the

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.240
other one okay which proves again that

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.890
men having sex is dominant

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:50.930
yeah you want it the winner gets the

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.970
[ __ ] of course the loser gets [ __ ]

have the pope of course yeah he won't

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:32.500
represent them actually ancient ancient

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.260
it's one of the most original

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.250
Christianity's so it's more ancient than

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.390
