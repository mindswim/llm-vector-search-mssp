[ __ ] your life in the bathroom I was

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.170
looking in the mirror I was like Who am

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.820
I and directly to my left comedian and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.310

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.100
million followers and then he has work

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.990
from that yeah you're the most

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.099
successful person here yeah but you know

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.959
what I think it's the way Karen worded

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.450
it and the way she's kind of sounded

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.220
that I was I felt like I should have had

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.150
a great answer but I was just like oh no

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.000
I'm not a comedian I just I'm here it's

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.380
just my white girl cantinas never ever

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.989
personal I just scream what are you to

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.420
people and I expect answers I just plant

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.670
mines in their heads that go off at some

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.470
well the judgment comes from you like I

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.580
didn't put the judgment there right I

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.200
was just like what the [ __ ] are you but

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.580
the one who judged your life is you

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.680
absolutely I think that that was just

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.349
one of those underlying things that was

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.480
in my head for a while that that was

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.280
just waiting to go off and you triggered

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.769
it and now I'm all [ __ ] up mentally

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:50.880
well let's say thank you for that

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.980
there's parts of you that I feel never

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.870
see the light my responsibility is

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.700

imagine you must be delighted did

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.769
alright correct me if I'm wrong are both

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.769
of you guys from Philly so I'm from like

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.500
the Philly suburbs okay how much nicer

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.430
are you saying I didn't even know that

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.530
yeah where are you from Elkins Park oh

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.500
nice yeah I'm from Mechanicsburg

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.090
Pennsylvania but then I moved to Philly

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.739
I lived in Phoenix break that's a real

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.519
place that's a real place wow it is so

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.380
like I feel like that's a you know

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.840
mining town with you know garages

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.910
everywhere sounds like you mind four

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.829
cars there where is mechanicsburg it's a

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.200
little west of Harrisburg okay

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.350
no where's Harrisburg no I think yeah

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.510
Harrisburg's a better indicator than the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.890
annex Berg for sure yeah

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:01.530
where's Philly first question yeah

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.959
before that means everyone here thinks

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.260
I'm dumb enough to not know where is

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.959
Philly in Pennsylvania yeah in

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.910
Pennsylvania have no idea okay no I

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:12.630
don't know

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.430
I've lived in Florida and California I

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.510
don't know where Philly is I've never

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.310
visited Philly I've never been there

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.919
I've looked at a map somewhere if you

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.039
have yes like you know what the what the

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.690
state of Pennsylvania looks like the

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.720
bottom

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.010
the bottom like do you think it's the

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.380
west or east side the east corner

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.030
[ __ ] idiot however I do feel like you

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.560
were rolling the dice on that answer

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.270
you really did I think Philly was a

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.190
state yes but I know where it is yeah I

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.130
mean there's I mean New York's closer to

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.500
Philly than Pittsburgh and they're in

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.120
the same state so it just kind of shows

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.340
you you know the layout of Pennsylvania

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.230
alone but there you go they got a map up

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.570
for you you know you mailed yeah yeah

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.920
that's exactly where I was imagining it

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.490
you nailed it but so Philly I mean I

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.250
guess I guess would you call that the

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.260
closest like large large city that you

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.470
guys are you know to like you can kind

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.310
of relate to um from the suburbs though

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.330
really so I relate to Philly somewhat I

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.490
relate to I relate to the weird Philly

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.800
vowels or whatever but yeah there is

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.600
that accent down from the Philly area

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.060
enough to be like influence Philly

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.560
influence as a Charlie I don't know I

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.419
don't really really do I live there I

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.400
lived there for the last three years but

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.220
I've lived here for like half a year

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.300
yeah like six months

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.100
oh you've only lived here for six months

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.640
your brand-new house it has the

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.620
experience been I liked it I thought I

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.479
was gonna hate it significantly more

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.800
what I liked it that's completely

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.040
opposite for me oh yeah really Kim Kim's

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.140
had a rough transition for a second all

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.760
right so you're used to it and grow up

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.270
no it's Dave I'll tell you I was sure

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.100
that literally sting it brings people

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.820
together

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.620

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.920
off the train and guy was just standing

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.680
in a stairway just [ __ ] his pants oh

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.340
yeah just a ton of [ __ ] yeah [ __ ]

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:40.970
crazy

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.950
very very common you've seen crazier

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.130
stuff than me yeah I mean I haven't seen

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.990
anything really critical guy jerk off a

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.450
couple times that's not that's you know

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.070
well that was I was excited when it

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.450
happened that was like my first one

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.430
correctly that was your first one yeah I

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.400
saw I saw a guy jerking off like this

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.440
month it's been a big month [ __ ] his

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:00.860
pants

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.250
it sounds off that's crazy Don a bunch

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.130
of [ __ ] off his list you really good and

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.080
they're really there really is that list

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.840
I think that every person who is not

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.810
from here which is a lot of people yeah

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.880
yeah and they really there really is

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.520
that kind of like checklist of like okay

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.680
this is what I'm expecting to run into

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.810
at some point right and have you have

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.120
you encountered anything like what would

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.140
be on your list

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.420
so it's look I've lived here for a

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.090
really long time and the list is like it

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.530
actually you know it's like super

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.150
exaggerated but also completely true

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.100
right you know you're like I'm gonna see

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.690
somebody [ __ ] yes although it took

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.490
me like nine years of being here to see

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.960
someone shooting in public and I saw I

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.270
was like there we go yeah yeah that kind

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.310
of sounds like what Kim's run into like

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.150
you just saw log of their own [ __ ]

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.920
and then growing it into a trash can

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.200
that's all see it sounds like we've all

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.640
encounter that's one thing that we've

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.890
all encountered now Shane I'm sure in

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.740
your mind like to see this obviously

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.180
what right out in the open you're like

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.670
holy [ __ ] this is like this is insane

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.860
but like we all said we've all been able

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.910
to check that one off

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.500

to yourself yeah have you guys

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.400
encountered that yeah millions do train

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.589
cars like the train pulls up in every

00:10:03.589 --> 00:10:05.300
other cars packed and there's one car

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:14.600
with no one in it and car there's a

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.870
reason you see you've learned that yes

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.339
I've learned it I'm telling you it's

00:10:19.339 --> 00:10:20.660
actually embarrassing how many times

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.089
I've had to learn I do repeat mistakes

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:26.029
like I still once in a while cam like a

00:10:26.029 --> 00:10:27.440
naive sweet little girl I like catch

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.700
myself looking at an empty train car

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.600
going great empty no no yeah it's always

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.940
a regional last week actually after our

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.820
last show Kim and I went down to the F

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.209
train over here on first half or second

00:10:41.209 --> 00:10:44.839
half and we go to get on a train and I

00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:46.490
swear to God what did we take one step

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.630
and we go not a chance

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.080
an issue I was worried it was adult it

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.700
smelt like adult poop on dry ground

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.250
there was actually people in that car

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.970
and I don't know how they were in that

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.860
karley be there yeah I don't know why

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.079
but obviously the other car was crowded

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:06.120
but we were like we put up with the

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.680
smell some people just stick it out I

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.420
have you ever been on hot car called hot

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.939
cars like it's on in the summer there's

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:15.389
no dead of the summer like there's

00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:17.870
always one car and I've watched people

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.829
stick it out the whole way where I'm

00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:22.110
saying being like I mean we can't

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.329
explain if this up so explain what it is

00:11:24.329 --> 00:11:25.620
to the people who have no idea what hot

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.149
cars so the train is made up of cars

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:31.769
connected obviously and in the summer

00:11:31.769 --> 00:11:33.750
they run the a/c so it's like it's

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.220
unbearable on the platform but it's like

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.779
fine on the train for the most part but

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:39.660
then every so often there's one car with

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.459
no a/c it's just broken it's been

00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:42.750
running all day long like that and the

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.120
train itself is a hot thing that

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.889
produces a ton of heat so you get in

00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:49.019
there and it's so welter it's it's a

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:52.410
song ungodly it's almost a godly and you

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.300
you have to make a choice it's like so

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.709
it's not the smell the smell will really

00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:56.970
force you one way or the other but the

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.560
hot car you're like and I'm always

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.230
stoned when I'm it like that time of the

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.819
night and I'm like Oh find myself in a

00:12:02.819 --> 00:12:03.810
hot car yeah

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.970
so I'm like it's almost trippy the

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.829
experience yeah and people just ride I

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:09.600
can almost see like steam rising they

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.269
must fast are we doing this yeah and

00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:13.740
sometimes I do and sometimes I don't and

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.870
you know to go off of your point of that

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.290
the cars sometimes and it corrected me

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.879
if you if I'm wrong if you've never

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:22.860
experienced this it could be a hundred

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.600
degrees on the platform and you're

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.279
sweating and then you get onto the train

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:28.319
and you're [ __ ] freezing because they

00:12:28.319 --> 00:12:30.120
overcompensate and you're covered in

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.420
sweat yeah it is it is one one extreme

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.050
to the next

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.449
I love it I mean I mean that really is

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:38.250
part of it that's part of the summer

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.500
it's you're probably the same person on

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.420
the platform who loves when a train

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.970
passes and that waft

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.279
of absolute garbage air you know now

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:50.569
people's like the [ __ ] the subways

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:53.129
absolutely disgusting I'm a human being

00:12:53.129 --> 00:12:55.019
and I need to feel cool air so it's like

00:12:55.019 --> 00:12:56.639
don't pretend like you don't also feel

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:59.339
that way and everybody own it you own it

00:12:59.339 --> 00:13:00.899
and I give you a lot of credit for that

00:13:00.899 --> 00:13:04.230
the only honest [ __ ] here yeah I hate

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.800
it it's so dirty

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.959
yeah it is of course it's so dirty yeah

00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:10.429
I like it have you been for something

00:13:10.429 --> 00:13:13.009
yeah well I moved here during the summer

00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:16.939
so I I was still new to the experience I

00:13:16.939 --> 00:13:19.009
still liked it I got I still like

00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:23.179
excited to ride trains it's gonna real

00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:25.399
hype to be like yeah figure out where I

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:27.799
was going to actually get it right and

00:13:27.799 --> 00:13:30.829
then I did I also there weren't homeless

00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:32.480
people in the [ __ ] subway because it

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.079
was hot cold they all just went in there

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:37.999
and I feel like there's more now than

00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:39.589
there have been in the past like certain

00:13:39.589 --> 00:13:41.029
shit's different from 10 years ago

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.939
noticeably like that our winters are way

00:13:43.939 --> 00:13:45.920
less harsh we still get mad snow here

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.899
now it's like nothing it's creepy and

00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:49.850
there's so many more in my opinion so

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.709
many more homeless and it's like worse

00:13:51.709 --> 00:13:53.629
than it's been they're like in dire dire

00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:55.670
straits yeah it does seem like obviously

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.410
that's a that's a huge epidemic in New

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.230
York you know you think it does play a

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.059
role that you know we're getting out of

00:14:02.059 --> 00:14:04.040
the cold season now total and they're

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.179
gonna you're gonna see them start to

00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:06.379
come out a little bit more do you love

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:09.139
New York in that summer I was a huge fan

00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:10.759
when you start walking being able to

00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:13.579
walk places and shorts so yes you leave

00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:15.799
earlier and you just walk everywhere you

00:14:15.799 --> 00:14:17.299
know you could be 3 o'clock in the

00:14:17.299 --> 00:14:18.259
morning and there's still a lot of

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:23.990
people on the sidewalks I'm so sick of

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:29.420
not being cute it's seasonal and then

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.889
you go down the subway and the subway

00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:33.470
like pushes up your dress the air I know

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:47.600
you feel alright just came oh my god

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.220
Karen yeah no I know the type of girl

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.379
that Karen is now that she's just so bad

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.940
so you just pick all that up for me as

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.160
you're saying one thing the inflection I

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.210
know the type of girl you are she's

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:36.590
psycho it is I guess it is first when

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.440
you google your name one of the top

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.960
categories is that you are all about

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:51.080
open relationships I was at the top

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.130
Google interview on inside Amy she liked

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.450
talk to us for a couple minutes about

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.800
and liked this little segment so I'm

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.290
guessing that floated us up to that oh

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.290
that's fine yeah okay

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.700
we've talked we talked about it like

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.170
once pretty publicly and a bunch of

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.240
times also publicly no completely [ __ ]

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.360
that so yeah no that's a hard no for me

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.740
I do not believe in that anymore

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.620
that is a [ __ ] no and here's the

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.400
thing that's like you know I this isn't

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.410
this isn't just about like my

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.000
relationship or whatever that was

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.890
actually kind of fine but like that part

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.890
of it and I don't know I think I'm done

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.270
with that part of my I feel like that's

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:36.440
destined to fail yeah yeah it's well

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.900
you're gonna find someone you like also

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.300
yeah someone else if you have sex with

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.590
enough people you're gonna find someone

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.690
else you like again even if you don't

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.640
like them the the feelings of jealousy

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.710
and insecurity which are normal and

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.240
natural and I've had someone say to me

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.310
like oh you need to like get the under

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.170
control no I don't I have good reasons

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.970
for that those are human normal emotions

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.160
so no to invite them into your life like

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.340
that and just relationships are already

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.810
effort I hate when people like work but

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.520
it is effort even the great ones like

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.550
why make it more right and I feel like

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.380
Kim you are problem

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.569
the complete opposite end of the

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.680
spectrum if Louis even would you say

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.360
last week Lewis isn't even allowed to go

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:47.030
outside during all right well believe it

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.230
or not we are gonna talk a little bit

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.030
about the subway today there was

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.470
something that I wanted to get get off

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.400
right off the bat there is a video of I

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.490
don't know if you guys saw any of this

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.020
kids that were dancing around like a

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.810
platform fire over the weekend yeah okay

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.990
so this is so this has happened to us in

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.460
the past with you know where we always

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.470
talk about context of videos and how

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.030
things can really get like blown out of

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:17.690
context right so someone send me a video

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:21.410
of again it was a there was a big fire

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.470
actually and we have video of it but

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.660
there's a fire on the platform and two

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.730
kids are the only ones on the platform

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.310
and they're taking selfies and shooting

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.340
videos of each other in front of this

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:39.080
fire so this is rate when this is rate

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.730
one another train pulled into the state

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.560
it looks like a mess fire AB for a

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.870
second yeah actually it does yeah I

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.850
didn't even notice that I love this city

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.460
so much so people so people were sending

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.230
the video in so immediately what do you

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.140
think he's doing a music video like a

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.810
you think you think those two kids are

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.360
the ones who started the fire and I'm

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.450
doing it for whether it's for pictures

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.460
on Instagram whether it's a music video

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.880
so that's right there's no one else on

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.530
the platform I know but it's like that's

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.150
such a if you've lived it for any length

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.350
of time you know the police don't [ __ ]

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.060
around and that is such a [ __ ] crazy

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.060
felony like for the gram that you you

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.620
that's a gramma below meant you see a

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.270
fire you're like right [ __ ] take a

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.120
picture but

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.850
I started so so I well so yes and no

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.980
because someone did start it it just

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.690
wasn't that Oh gotcha gotcha I mean it

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:40.650
wasn't a natural starting fire detective

00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:44.409
but you know I think there was some kind

00:19:44.409 --> 00:19:46.090
of I think I put a caption up it said

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.970
something along the lines of when doing

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.500
it from the grant when doing it for the

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.169
gram turns into doing time for you know

00:19:53.169 --> 00:19:54.820
arson or something along those lines

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.399
oh you mean assumptions I did I did and

00:19:57.399 --> 00:20:00.010

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.470

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.660
approach that got sent in this week guys

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.440
if you pull that one up

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:11.370
oh [ __ ] face was that for a hat so that

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.110
looks like probably the worst approach I

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.700
could think of oh god your heads just

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.650
waiting to get [ __ ] split off yeah

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.170
well if a train is coming look at the

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.420
position this guy's in there's he can't

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.220
do anything he's completely at his

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.860
friends mercy for the people who are

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.460
listening who can't see this right now I

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.510
don't know she do you want to set this

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:30.900
up

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.370
for the people who like what we're

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.330
looking at right now for the people who

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.830
can't see drunk dude dropped his hat and

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.980
used

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.670
I don't know used his shitty friend I

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:47.309
don't know buy an one arm and one leg

00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:49.290
dangling him in onto the tracks where a

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.929
headfirst where he is straining to reach

00:28:51.929 --> 00:28:54.840
his honestly hideous hat yeah such an

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.179
ugly has him sideways if a train were

00:28:57.179 --> 00:28:58.559
coming his friend would panic try to

00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:00.179
pull him back instead of to the side and

00:29:00.179 --> 00:29:02.100
he would [ __ ] die right the other

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.840
idiots and right there Venice and it

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.370
would be like really bad the way he died

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.050
like his head would fly off dude it

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.510
would be a grape explosion yeah and they

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.920
would be all over the friend it would be

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.660
a mess dude it would delay everybody's

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.190
[ __ ] commute it's selfish to do that

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:19.260
I wish they did die though this drunk

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.790

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.410

be done but I won't risk my life for a

00:30:58.559 --> 00:31:00.570

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:12.510
precious one of all versus a puppy who

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.370
doesn't give a [ __ ] about me that was so

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.140

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.950
the median on the inside of the highway

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.630
so you don't wanna be hypocrite I didn't

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:35.640

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.950
they won't I don't know I just can't I

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.110
can't imagine that feeling of holding a

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.760
puppy and being like well now we're both

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.820

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.390

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.040
strength you have to have to [ __ ]

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:04.080
lifter it's like fine pretty it's a lot

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:09.780
higher than people can't tell they jump

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:15.090
down too deep to jump before you do it I

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:16.890
probably wouldn't do it I did clarify

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.670
that you've learned a lot since since

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:24.900
starting this oh yeah I feel like every

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:32.730
episode you recite guys do you guys know

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:36.060
the John Rocker quote no no I can't wait

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.680
to repeat it next podcast I got John

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.570
Rocker the pitcher yeah John Rocker got

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.100
in trouble cuz he said he would never

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.420
want to live in New York and he cited

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.030
the subway that's why he got a bunch of

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.380
trouble this isn't like ninety nine

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.390
right probably when he was sorry I

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:49.980
looked at the quote up cuz I've got in

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.630
trouble I don't know he was like I can't

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:52.950
imagine living in New York he's like you

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.540
go on the subway you sit next to some

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.640

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.960
[ __ ] from Georgia like it was because

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.130
he'd insulted the subway they knew

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:21.690
because I remember I remember that

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:22.710

quote right there in the middle so he's

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.380
from George's I think I don't like about

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.510
New York or the foreigners I'm not a

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:43.500

no batteries no I've always been yeah

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.000
it's when you're a girl it's different

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.210
if you don't get battery yeah on the

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.069
street cleaning and throwing batteries I

00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:26.059
mean I was a [ __ ] makes it hard to

00:37:26.059 --> 00:37:32.799
[ __ ] them ten when I was ten yeah I bet

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.930
booth could you guys get [ __ ] John

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.579
Rocker sprinting out of the bullpen for

00:37:43.579 --> 00:37:44.180
me please

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.609
all right go ahead yeah that should be

00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:48.440
too hard I mean that that's what he was

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.710
[ __ ] known for like cuz so though they

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.569
probably don't know but well shoes

00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:55.670
pitchers usually take their [ __ ] long

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.619
ass time gettin from the bullpen to the

00:37:57.619 --> 00:37:59.210
mound bullpens out in the outfield it's

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:00.349
all the way out there so when they're

00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:01.670
subbed in they have to walk the whole

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:02.839
way to the mound sometimes they take a

00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:05.329
golf cart sometimes that's good schools

00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:07.940
walk yeah John Rocker was so racist he

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:12.290
sprinted and he's a hero he's a hero

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:15.890
this guy dude Enter Sandman this fat

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.640
racist

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.590

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:23.740
him is that that can't be him

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.470
no unless he played yeah cuz that he was

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:28.870
in like the 90s players trying to run is

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.060
really funny yeah it is wow yeah

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.540
especially these are the most unfit

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:39.400
athletes fair they are they're like

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.320
fatter than golfers I'm more curious now

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.370
they're definitely more athletic than

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.080
golfers you know that can't be right

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.850
there's an entire sport consistently

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:47.140
John Daly

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.540

peaceful Chavez oh there's lost all

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:06.340
credibility with that one baseball job

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:29.050

professional golfer you know that I take

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.560
it that comes with golf you know the

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.760
etiquette that comes with [ __ ]

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:56.020
podcasting to do this I'm smoking right

00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:03.610
now call me John Daly which weed oh okay

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.160
so something else happened over the

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.510
weekend there was a guy who actually

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.640
this is this is one of my ultimate fears

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.680
and why I never stand on the edge of the

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.260
platform he got thrown onto the tracks

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.450
when I'd forget what day this happened

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.790
just happened with us know this happened

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.820
last couple days actual yes video not

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.410
only did he guess and not only did he

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:25.300
get thrown onto the tracks but the guy

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.480
had a [ __ ] lock on a string and

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.230
wouldn't let him back up

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.549
so there's no sound to this video

00:40:33.549 --> 00:40:37.660
unfortunately down and the other guy

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:40.150
he's not letting him up and he has if

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.410
you could see right there in his hand

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:43.319
you gotta fight through there

00:40:43.319 --> 00:40:46.390
yeah watch watch what the guy's reaction

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:48.849
is guy on the track this guy guy he

00:40:48.849 --> 00:40:50.770
needs to run because there's too much he

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.470
doesn't by the way he lays down no I

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.510
mean touching the third rail so yes so

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.220
Tara knows about the third rail host

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.380
Malone so he's laying he's basically

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.900
laying up next to the third rail it's

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.770
not a good idea

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:04.930
in fact he put his hand on it's a pony

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.480
he went down like so he laid down

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.760
because he said that in case a train

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.440
came he wanted to be able to lay down

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:17.349
under it on the track between I don't

00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:19.329
think you you run into the tunnel now

00:41:19.329 --> 00:41:21.599
you [ __ ] late there's argue that

00:41:21.599 --> 00:41:24.010
there's a little place to walk because

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.480
people work in there there's office as

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.520
long as there's no red and white there's

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.329
a place to go oh my god Mike oh here as

00:41:31.329 --> 00:41:32.650
long as there's no red and white there's

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.780
a place to go totally and some holes

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.299
like the stripes oh wow they have those

00:41:37.299 --> 00:41:38.799
manholes built in for what they're

00:41:38.799 --> 00:41:40.180
working on I mean you see look they all

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.650
talk but that is terrifying that that

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:43.930
guy's just is there audio on this no

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:46.390
unfortunately there isn't dude by most

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:47.980
terrifying thing I've ever seen I don't

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.059
want to hear what they're talking about

00:41:49.059 --> 00:41:50.829
and everybody's just standing there and

00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:53.470
letting that guy will not let him up

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:55.750
yeah so if you notice there's an MTA

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.760
employee to the other side of this guy

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.950
and you know with them they're like nope

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.390
we're waiting till police get you we are

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.069
not intervening with this [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:06.099
Union yeah is that Union Square no no I

00:42:06.099 --> 00:42:10.180
just mean oh yeah what was he doing wait

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:14.319
okay can we why do we have this video

00:42:14.319 --> 00:42:16.750
and there's no more you had to have got

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.480
another video of this no no that was

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.220
that was all they had because there was

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.839
freshman there's a manhunt for the guy

00:42:22.839 --> 00:42:25.059
who pushed that a guy the guy died

00:42:25.059 --> 00:42:27.510
I'm sorry no he did not how'd he get up

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:30.160
eventually before train came that guy

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.740
with the block walked away and he was

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:33.880
able to get back though you know that

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.670
guy I don't know the relationship okay

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:41.770
this cannot we cannot put this out and

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:42.750
not have

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:45.030
the answer is there an update on the

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.160
screen I mean if you could find anything

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.800
are you gonna exclude that is that it's

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.720
my worst nightmare God is my yeah

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.040
someone holding a thing and you're

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.330
trying to get back up and everywhere you

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:55.830
run they're probably like there how

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.380
often do you see the people who's like

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:07.050
honestly their toes are like on there's

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:08.990
nowhere I can relax it's [ __ ] crazy

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:11.910
every time that's if the subway were one

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:13.200
of those places you're really losing you

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.900
know I wish list somewhere every time we

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.460
go the first thing he does I like it

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:18.720
could be a thing like the Train just

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.090
four minutes away or one minute away he

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:22.710
always has to step on the yellow lines

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:24.570
and lean over and look it makes me calm

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:27.359
faster no it doesn't yeah it does shave

00:43:27.359 --> 00:43:30.060
seconds off your community it's crazy

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.430
and I'm like stop doing that you know

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:33.990
it's three minutes away you know it's a

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:36.359
minute away stop leaning over the rail

00:43:36.359 --> 00:43:38.040
for no reason I can't tell men [ __ ] like

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.200
that you got to just go alright and then

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.599
you back up several feet no until he

00:43:42.599 --> 00:43:46.200
learns it well I've been here if his

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.060
kids ever with him he's you know that's

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:52.380
that's okay that makes it close to

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.970
that's what I was gonna say that kid's

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:55.980
gonna grow up you know constantly doing

00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:02.390
that one of the least things that's

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:10.680
gonna be James's problem now there's

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.420
worse happens yeah that is a great point

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.800
I take it all back

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.859
wait is this the UH okay so good

00:44:16.859 --> 00:44:18.930
Samaritans eventually help the man back

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.450
on the platform that's when the bearded

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:23.580
man walked up and smacked him in the

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.290
face oh oh

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:27.839
the MTA worker killed the power that's

00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:31.260
why when he is such a UH okay there's

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.580
half the story I guess I didn't know

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.109
they could kill the power individually I

00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:35.580
didn't either I thought the tracks yeah

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.410
I didn't I didn't know that either way

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:39.210
just shut the whole subway down yeah

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:42.180
really yeah oh yeah no I mean yeah that

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:42.780
makes sense

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.130
like now that I'm thinking about it

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:46.109
makes sense that it's individual power

00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:49.170
line has to be yeah I'm always like this

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:50.940
is what I wonder you know whenever

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.290
they're like hey we're stopping the

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.700
train right now because we're gonna let

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.250
the a train pass is our

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.550
survival dependent on these people like

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:01.050
could they does not communicate the

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:02.610
right way and crash the trains together

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:05.010
a hundred percent really yes have you

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:07.230
ever seen them have you ever seen some

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.120
of the people driving the trains they do

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:09.930
a really good job

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.700
they do very competent yes yes they're

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.720
late they're actually really good this

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.280
week the city always looks like it's

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.960
about to fall apart but the systems are

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.500
actually really robust okay they're good

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.990
yeah so I did some nice they feel that I

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:24.750
did see something about the tracks there

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:26.640
are there is like a certain amount of

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.400
space on the tracks where it's almost

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.320
like trying to put two batteries

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.180
together on the opposite sides where

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.280
it's like it pushes all them off so I

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.170
don't know that the trains can run into

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:37.770
each other

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:39.360
there's like something that is like

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.280
there's like some kind of fail-safe

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.860
system that's in there but because it

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.990
seems like it's like humans [ __ ] up oh

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:47.850
yeah and especially when you're using

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:50.100
our archaic system like the New York

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:51.930
City subway like it's just bound to fail

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:54.660
at some point but I agree you know it's

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.070
it's a little scary to know that that's

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:59.280
in their hands but um you know so is

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.780
pretty much everything else that we have

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:03.090
going on in the city so you know you

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:04.740
just kind of rely on that and hope

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:09.000
nothing happens this was something I

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.380
wanted to touch this was something I

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.120
wanted to bring up last week but we ran

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.000
out of time there was a guy this is

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.800
totally off topic with subway by the way

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.840
but it's just too good of a story to

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.270
pass up there was a guy in Australia who

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:24.810
tried to sue his boss for farting at

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:28.830
work 1.3 million dollars old and well

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.120
first of all why that number you know

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:34.400
where does the 1.3 come from by also

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.380
apparently that guy the guy so here's

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.840
the whole story so he lost the case it's

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.450
over but he wound up moving out of his

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:44.700
communal space at work because the boss

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:48.570
kept farting and they gave him a new and

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:49.800
maybe this was intentional I don't know

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.750
they gave him a new office that was very

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:54.840
small and had no windows and five or six

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.380
times a day

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.390
thought the boss would come into the

00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.330
communal space and just fart and

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:04.050
sometimes on him this guy went to court

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:08.090
and tried to see the boss lost lose

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:10.930
because

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:14.210
I think it was because he tried to sue

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.730
specifically for bullying like that was

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:18.170
his argument that he was getting bullied

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:19.820
that's a really good way to bully

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.440
someone it's just a fart Innerspace a

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.260
lot I guess yeah this is Australia I've

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.610
been bullying wrong all these years

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:28.880
right well they just I I don't know if

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.770
maybe that's why he lost because it was

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:33.320
too specific like I don't know he should

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.430
have been like that was sexual

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:37.460
harassment because it's harassment or

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.950
like like if he's actually touching him

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:41.660
and farting on him like maybe take the

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.460
assault angle I don't know this is true

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.120
I'd be like he raped me with his farts

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.250
yeah yeah I mean I this is serious I had

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:51.230
a guy who I used to work with who used

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:52.160
to do that to me

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.280
we used to have like like cubicles and

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.500
he would come in and he would do that

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.360
exact thing and then leave sounds like

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.820
now my father he's funny no it was a

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.650
sermon I be I need medicine I didn't

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:05.510
[ __ ] I was laughing good it was just

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.030
funny because now you know all of a

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:09.500
sudden someone else would come into my

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.830
vehicle and I'm sitting there taking the

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:14.600
blame for yeah but I was laughing about

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.130
forgive me I take the blame for a lot of

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:23.570
farts I would take the blame yeah we

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:26.980
would definitely all be looking at you

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:33.050
any of you yeah I don't ever know listen

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:35.060
I admitted you said you're either a

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.160
three or thirty person yeah right when I

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.800
was in high school I was doing like TV

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.390
production classes and we each had like

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:43.190
these pods and we would go like record

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:44.960
like voiceovers and do like little

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.180
videos or whatever and it was like a the

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:48.680
end of each week we had to have a new

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.660
video to submit to the teacher and she'd

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:52.220
come in and sit with you you put the

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:54.170
headphones on and watch it and there was

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:55.880
this girl I really didn't like that was

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:59.000
in the class after me and while I was

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.320
recording my video I noticed that she

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.480
had the same pot as me so that means her

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.100
files were a court saved on the same

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:07.070
computers me so I replaced her audio

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:09.620
with me just farting like I farted into

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:13.910
the mic and I just put it on repeat so

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:16.760
it she came in with the DJ it was just

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.190
my heart when this happened 16 because

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:21.780
this is genetic

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.210
and I did I did it with my friend in the

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:27.480
room and we like when we played back the

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.610
sound of that fart it was the funniest

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:34.920
thing I'm happy for you right now so how

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.950
did you save it - saved as like we'd

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:39.870
renamed it as her project and everything

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:44.460
I need the truck no but she turned that

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.170
in and they sat together and played it

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:50.970
and it was just my phone oh the perfect

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:53.970
crime I just have a memory to this day

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.790
yeah so we won't talk like the girl that

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:58.260
was in the room with me we won't talk

00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.910
for like ten years at a time

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.380
and we'll see each other a little bit

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.670
like remember when we farted in the mic

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:07.620
and a brother it's like when you cut

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.790
yourself and you put your blood together

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:14.700
like that that's um that's what I'm glad

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.500
that was that story was able to come up

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.320
for this never never in a million years

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.790
thought that that story would come up on

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:22.770
the subway creatures podcast but I'm so

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.440
glad that it did some relatable topic I

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.510
wish we had a recording of an Australian

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:32.400
dude getting upset with farts yeah could

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.670

we did such an arbitrary number

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:36.510
is well it's Australian so probably it's

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:43.020
like a million us in his office like a

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.640

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:50.370
I just got the last like right when the

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:52.140
last cuz if you're doing it five times a

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.490
day that means right when the smell of

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.610
this whole court thing and when they

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:13.380
asked him he said he didn't recall doing

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.750
it but may have farted a couple times I

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:20.340

accurate yeah that's exactly how I

00:52:56.550 --> 00:53:02.670

point is just like who's Nipsey Hussle I

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:33.360
I looked him up I still don't know who

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:33.930
he is

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:36.690
that's how much I hard to recognize and

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:40.070
everyone's like he had the cure to a oh

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.360
that is the rumor going around

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.220
yeah the rumors that he had security I

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.080
did see that conspiracy it's like

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.090
everyone sharing these things and

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:49.560
everyone's sharing this quote because he

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.540
did a radio show and he and people are

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.070
like this is crazy if people are telling

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:54.540
you that you shouldn't get involved with

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:55.920
the documentary because the government's

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.180
gonna come after you and nipsey's like

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.610
yeah if they come for me you all need a

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:01.200
ride or he said something like that so

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.030
people are taking that quote and they're

00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:05.430
like if you if they come for me y'all

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:06.960
need a ride and then there's like all

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.880
these like people on Instagram and

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.200
they're posting like that picture with

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.240
like the black hand going like this like

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.040
we ride in and it's like what the [ __ ]

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.190
is anyone doing riding Wyatt I think

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:19.500
going after the government cuz of Nipsey

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.200
Hussle right now yeah there's I mean the

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.910
Franz Ferdinand of World War three

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:25.710
what's happening hustle

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:29.570
yeah wow that history reference

00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:35.880
affiliate of me you know what I'm saying

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.500
I just know where it was I think there

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:42.030
actually is surveillance footage there

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:43.860
is surveillance footage of him getting

00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:46.080
shot by injury it's like a drive-by like

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.600
they're the bunch of people said it they

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.500
said it you know they said it was like

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.390
gang violence there's definitely that's

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:54.570
what I would say the guy lived in what

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:56.970
was it Compton Crenshaw I don't know

00:56:56.970 --> 00:57:02.940
it's all come to me you wreck the ghetto

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:08.940
it definitely was but that was that was

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:11.970
a big thing he was Johnnie Walker had

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:15.330
the money to live however he wanted and

00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:18.300
he chose to stay where he was that's

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.220
nice that's a nice thing that he decided

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:23.990
he stayed humble is this is what happens

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:31.670
you got some racism in there I like it

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:34.030
many a time in here

00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:36.460
it comes out no Nipsey Hussle I guess

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:38.680
you know who's famous but it's I think

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.000
what I think the real problem is

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.710
definitely people random people being

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:45.190
like oh man this is a huge loss so yeah

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:46.599
it sucks look and I think that's your

00:57:46.599 --> 00:57:48.160
point right that's your point game right

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.890
yeah yeah yeah sucks he died but it's

00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:54.160
like sad now I also love that every week

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.200
when we when we pull up your segment

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.000
it's always something like controversial

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.990
in the in the means that like you know

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:03.910
that there are people hardcore on one

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:05.680
side oh yeah that will be pissed if they

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.410
heard you say that yeah I love that I

00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:10.510
love that yeah absolutely

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:14.410
oh yeah we what are the sides maybe

00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:17.710
hustle people are like wow this was the

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:20.890
king can we pull up ain't no [ __ ] and

00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:21.910
then don't give a [ __ ] about Nipsey

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:23.650
Hussle those yeah yeah well yeah it's

00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:25.000
like it's like people who are like who

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.530
the [ __ ] is Nipsey Hussle why do we care

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:28.270
and then there's the other side that's

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:31.089
like the the world lost the greatest

00:58:31.089 --> 00:58:34.780
person and you know like he was a legend

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.960
and it's like who was he name one nipsey

00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:49.420
song name one wait but kendrick lamar

00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:55.770
[ __ ] could be wrong every rap song ever

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.140
you did some stuff in the Black Panthers

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:13.350
soundtrack good shot I saw that he I've

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:14.820
never heard that and that's probably a

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:18.450
hit right that's a big one he also cured

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:24.090
AIDS he was about to cure a this is also

00:59:24.090 --> 00:59:25.619
getting that you know they call it like

00:59:25.619 --> 00:59:27.690
the Michael Jackson treatment where it's

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:29.490
like once someone dies all of a sudden

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:31.680
their their music comes up again and it

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:34.020
like it's selling through the roof like

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:35.610
yeah I figure what the number is but his

00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:39.030
music is like it's because of what Mac

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:42.060
Miller - and he dies every Sox's Mac

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:44.670
Miller's last album was so [ __ ] good

00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:47.190
really yeah it's so good like he was

00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:48.780
addicted to drugs so he got he got

00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:51.600
really deep and it was good see I like

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:57.150
Mac Miller's last elements really felt

00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:59.820
kind of sad listening no I don't know

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.190
yeah I'm called 2009 that's real

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:04.890
depressing it's good yeah it is it is

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:06.810
the like I do like the rap where you

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:08.670
know they actually are coming from a

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:10.680
place whether it's in their real life or

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.410
in their head and it's not just you know

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:15.570
the [ __ ] regular [ __ ] where they're

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:18.210
talking about Rick sounds like an old

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:26.160
white be the n-word button yeah but this

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:31.770

devastation destroyed social media I

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.119

part do you like that that's not your

01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:58.800

your girlfriend friend yeah those are

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:05.280

dating comedian that would have like

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:18.140

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.700
someone that I respect who's like a

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.800

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.740
part is is she wasn't trying to be funny

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.190

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:49.850
gun violence tweet after Sandy Hook no

01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:51.950

something you'd probably see on any any

01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:26.480
New York street corner it kind of speaks

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.980
for itself so we'll just let this one

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:34.190
play out with audio yep yeah if you guys

01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:37.030

they just go back you crazy [ __ ] the

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.720

watch it without it whoa it's really

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:08.170
good that sound so it's yeah I mean that

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:10.840
sound is great but Dad the visual is

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:15.670
just as good oh wow she's hitting an

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:18.040
undercover cop soon yeah I don't know

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.330
which one the cop is that is out of

01:03:19.330 --> 01:03:19.750
control

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:20.800

we think he mocked her that [ __ ] let me

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.420
see that phone who's this [ __ ] tweet

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:42.730
the audio definitely helps but this

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:45.250
woman that Rick's so because there are

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:47.080
some good lines there are some good

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.570
lines in there that would make this so

01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:50.710
much better especially for the people

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:52.720
listen wait is this is this the

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.350
surveillance of Nipsey Hussle death by a

01:03:56.350 --> 01:04:00.700
fat white lady Missy trended he's trying

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.320
to make another hit and then the whites

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.600
got involved well like you're about to

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.630
cure AIDS dude nah white people can't

01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:21.460
have you burn for a second I mean the

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:24.490
balls on that woman no well I she

01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:25.660
doesn't look like the type of person who

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:26.860
can get her leg that high

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:29.670
kick the guy's glasses off of his face

01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:32.050
so for the people who were [ __ ]

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:35.020
listening and can't see this I'm

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.850
assuming it was a woman something happen

01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:38.170
with the cab because there's a cab with

01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:40.690
a cab door open she's fighting with

01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:43.420
looks like try you're just assuming that

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:44.800
that african-american man was a cab

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.890
driver because they don't know each

01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:48.880
other and they're fighting over

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.260
something and it looks like he's trying

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.790
to swipe her credit card in a phone he

01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:56.160
was bald you can see that much detail

01:04:57.019 --> 01:04:58.189
it looks like he's trying to swipe a

01:04:58.189 --> 01:04:59.059
credit card in the phone and when she

01:04:59.059 --> 01:05:01.130
kicks a credit card swiper flies we

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.630
treat detective this week I thought it

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:11.569
was his glasses that know or maybe but

01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:15.349
let's even go beginning like the

01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:17.719
beginning yeah we see are you oh is he

01:05:17.719 --> 01:05:23.809
holding his phone police you're right I

01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:25.789
saw the whole wrong thing I'd be a

01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:27.890
terrible witness I'd be like there was

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.380
so it was an Asian man right and a black

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:32.689
woman I was about to say I'd say like

01:05:32.689 --> 01:05:34.279
all the wrong races he couldn't be

01:05:34.279 --> 01:05:35.659
Indian I thought he was definitely black

01:05:35.659 --> 01:05:38.409
because he was bald but then Gandhi oh

01:05:38.409 --> 01:05:41.719
yeah it means can be bald yeah starting

01:05:41.719 --> 01:05:43.999
with Gandhi Gandhi was the first ball I

01:05:43.999 --> 01:05:46.219
mean this guy's got a guardian look to

01:05:46.219 --> 01:05:48.019
him to this lady looks British to be

01:05:48.019 --> 01:05:50.779
honest she look you can't she's dressed

01:05:50.779 --> 01:05:53.269
like a Brit she's never had to work it I

01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:55.130
bet if we had audio she spoke with a

01:05:55.130 --> 01:06:02.929
British accent what was the girls in

01:06:02.929 --> 01:06:09.049
