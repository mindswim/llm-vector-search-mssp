internet sooner or later

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.280
true yeah for me it was like i don't

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.719
want to tell people he has a newborn

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.079
people will know he's vulnerable this is

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.000
a good time yeah perfect time to attack

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.440
although is it though

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.239
when is your t higher than after you

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.079
encounter the life that you created by

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.039
[ __ ]

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.320
that's what i'm saying especially when

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.399
you have a daughter at home that's my my

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.680
job this whole time because you know

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.439
britney breastfeed so i'm not really

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.200
needed for anything yeah it's to lay in

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.720
bed next to her and think about what i

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.640
would do to somebody yeah if they came

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.080
in i'm like brit if someone came in here

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.680
i'd probably rip their arms off like

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.600
goro you're you're having a tidal effect

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600
on her estrogen oh yeah you're making

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.320
the milk sweeter

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.320
by imagining yourself like ripping a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.840
guy's head off on the front steps of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.880
your house

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.840
the baby's like

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.840
it's basically my job right now but yeah

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.040
no it's pretty tight it's funny too

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.320
because when you have your second kid

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.320
what i've noticed is like first one was

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.400
like oh my oh my god my whole life is

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.079
different second kid you're like

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.600
you throw it on the pile yeah my life's

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.960
a little more different i guess i don't

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.320
know it's like all right here we go i

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.000
was pumped but it was just not as like a

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.600
dream i was like i didn't sleep for like

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600
four days the first time yeah i got home

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.119
it was like all right i'm taking a nap

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.720
oh dude i remember the first time

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.240
holding my own baby i was like this

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.680
thing could come apart at any minute

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.920
yeah i felt like i was holding her body

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.680
together when i anytime i picked her up

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.840
i was like okay dude don't let her head

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.079
fall off yep and that that didn't go

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.840
away i would say for probably an entire

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.520
week an entire week of like constantly

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.719
like taking care of her i was just like

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.360
oh my god she's going to explode yep and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.720
their head like you put them in the crib

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.000
the second one you're like you're

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.840
one-arming them the first day

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.120
literally that's that's right like i

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.720
know where like i'll cradle the head

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.160
i'll hold the butt

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.560
dude our pediatrician we brought maya to

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.760
the pediatrician the first time i think

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.920
she did it to like show us but she

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.599
grabbed her by her ankles like a chicken

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.440
and just held her upside down to like

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440
check [ __ ] out yeah just to show her

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.040
like dude you can really swing these

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.000
things around shh

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.280
that sucks that's like someone borrowing

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.640
your bike and doing a wheelie you're

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.440
like

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.760
okay dude no i could

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.680
like we've noticed that during the first

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.360
checkup these babies have no wear and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.720
tear on them so we want to show you what

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.920
you can actually do like i was going to

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.680

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.120
showing us the built forward tough she

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.400
was like she was like you don't have to

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.920
handle it like that and she just went

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.920
honk and picked it up picked our baby up

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.360
by her legs

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.200
and just like yeah her legs look good

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.360

lifting his head up already and he was

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.120
stiffening his legs like we could put

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.680
him in our like on day one

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.920

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.000
felt like he was being born to a [ __ ]

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.599
so he had to come out and start

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.480
controlling [ __ ] from the gate yeah

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.640

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.800
[ __ ] dude and it creates such a force it

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.240
feels like it could backflip him out of

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.720
your hands

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.000

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.720
it's just like

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.199
i always say i always regret i whenever

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.639
you know what i really get jealous of is

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.800
when you see a video of like a baby

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.880
being born in like a natural like pool

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.639
so like they birth them into water and

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.639
then like i'm like wow that's i'll never

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.400
have that kid

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.120
my kids will never be as capable as this

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.000
day this minute zero infant swimming in

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.199
a pool

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.600
yeah i mean i don't know that's that's

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.120
also that could go another way of having

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.400
like a very weird skinny kid

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.039
you think skinny yeah i would say skinny

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.759
huh like terminally skinny

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.600
i always wonder where skinny those are

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.199
the people i understand least like an

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.280
extremely skinny guy i'm just like what

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.199
is it like what is your day what is your

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.120
life about yeah like so yeah just run it

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.639
by like so when you're out you order a

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.240
pizza you have like two slices and put

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.520
it in the freezer like what do you do

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.840
dude when i see a big fat guy

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.520
i can instantly imagine the physical

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.160
feeling of like just nine hour nine on a

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.080
couch and it's like my ass cheeks hurt

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.080
and i'm just pigging out i'm having my

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.400
second meal without standing up

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.440
and i'm like 60 episodes deep on an

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.360
anime that i kind of like

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.960
i'm not even like loving it but i'll

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.639
watch it

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.560
that's very fat behavior i can totally i

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.639

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.240
life when i see a super skinny dude i'm

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.680
just like

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.440
nothing like those skinny guys they have

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.960
a they have a [ __ ] limit though they

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.720
like they age like bread like as soon as

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.039
their time is up like for skinniness

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.639
they instantly start looking like those

and i watched it we like walked down

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.760
there she had like her ankles in dipped

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.200
down i saw that great it could just be

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.600
like a storm water catch yeah but i was

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.959
like yo

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:36.880
get up here i mean it is kept separate

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.040
from actual sewage but i don't know it

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.720
creates its own cesspool yeah it's gross

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.800
wait water you think it's just grabbing

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.639
like flushed toilets as they're passing

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:47.519
that's why

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:49.839
my mom was like that's sewage water

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:50.839
i've been

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:51.839
convinced mean

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:53.279
it's definitely brackish

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.639
it's definitely not [ __ ] it's not

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:57.360
good but i think it's just from

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.800
it touching like

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.480
rotten disgusting children i never

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.000
thought about that exposed pavement i

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.600
never thought about that kevin costner's

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.600
water world there were so many turds

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.200
from like the sewage system yeah when

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.720
all the water got flooded there's

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.079
probably so much sewage that's all the

00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:11.680
costs we're swimming in it's all sewage

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.320
it's probably what gave him gills

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:14.760
long enough

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.680
[Laughter]

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.360
but yeah it'd be nuts to see like a like

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.920
a really weird looking guy just like

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.519
standing there with a drinking straw

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:25.200
catching the fountain water as a like

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.120
psychopath

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.200
yeah dude well the whole point was my do

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.480
you think there's there's a level of

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.680
pedophilia oh yeah

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.810
[Laughter]

00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:48.480
baby soup

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.440
for real

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.240
like

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.440
some of them you'll get them hooked like

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.920
a sample it would be like uh morally no

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.880
because you're like giving them

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.560
dysentery it's like yeah this is your

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.560
thing but it's going to [ __ ] you up oh

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.760
man and they're all just trying to get

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.839
the sickest diarrhea from it like i got

00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:04.320
the nastiest little kid water dudes

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.519
checking out the toilet i feel like it's

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:08.399
a detroit style

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:10.160
as a pedophile your stomach can probably

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.360
take anything

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.279
because you're living in a like a such a

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:16.000
hyper adrenalized state yeah like like

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.360
the fact you're like all you're doing

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.240
like you're sitting there thinking about

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.760
[ __ ] kids all day and someone's like

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.199
hey man what's up and you're like

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:24.320
oh um nothing i i'm very i'm fine yeah

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.000
you're so your internal organs become

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.480
like a trash compactor yeah

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.240
it's just like those uh double shredder

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.000
videos anything goes in there you walk

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.279
past the playground you're thinking of

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:35.360
kabobbing all the kids

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.480
and someone's like good morning and

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.440
you're like dude

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.560
uh yes

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.480
hi sir good morning who do you think's

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.079
weirder guys that want to kill kids or

00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:45.440
guys that want to [ __ ] kids

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.800
[ __ ] them i think guys want to [ __ ] kids

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.480
are weirder definitely okay i can see

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.040
you wanting to kill kids okay

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.880
i can see being like dude i could

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.800
totally [ __ ] these guys up

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.560
that to me is i wouldn't i don't condone

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.079
that especially as you get it makes more

00:14:58.079 --> 00:14:59.440
sense you need to start testing your

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.720
strength

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.320
it's like a test of it's a test of what

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.680
you can do in the world like how many of

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.600
these kids can you think you can [ __ ] up

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.440
dude right can you organize your life to

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.199
get away with killing at least 10 kids

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:11.040
one at a

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:11.760
how long and then time

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.000
long can you pick out all at once but

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
then how the the real measure is how

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.519
long can you go without actually being

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.120
like caught before you're like a youtube

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.800
video of the police interrogation how

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.639
many kids you think you could kill yeah

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:24.320
dude the kids that lay alone in the

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.240
water fountain thing you could probably

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.760
snap you could probably snub a couple of

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.440
them out pretty easily

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.680
okay

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.199
yeah you have to make sure they have no

00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:36.639
real support system at the house

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.600
although i might go high profile yeah i

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.040
go hyper you don't see kids playing by

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.959
themselves that much so you'd have to

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:44.160
have somebody i'm not going to go

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.399
through how to kill someone

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:47.360
actually

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.600
formulated we're like

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.279
yeah actually formulated a plan how to

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:52.560
like distract their parents i'm like

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.720
dude let me not actually tell people how

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.279
to do that

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.759
yeah you need to create a good diversion

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.759
it'll be pretty tight yeah or you could

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:04.079
get this in as like a scout leader

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:05.440
you could just

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.120
dude you could just air drop something

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.240
onto the parent's phone at the

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.519
playground because they're just sitting

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:11.040
on the side you just hit them with

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.079
something that's going to catch their

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:13.759
attention like if it's a if it's a dad

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:15.199
by himself you hit him with a little bit

00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:16.800
of titty

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.560
and if it's a lady you like distracted

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.000
with like i don't know like uh air

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.519
dropper like an animal like a video of

00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:23.120
animals or something or would you what

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.800
you here's but here's what you could do

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.240
yeah you take a picture you're at a

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.639
playground you take a picture of a kid

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:29.759
you have to think enough you have to

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:31.759
have kids do this that's a perfect cover

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:32.480
because you're if you're at the

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.000
playground without kids everyone's like

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.680
who the [ __ ] that guy yeah so if

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.800
you're there you got your kids you gotta

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.000
have you gotta plan this out for like 10

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.519
years you gotta have kids let them be at

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:40.880
least like five years old so like no

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.920
one's gonna suspect you're walking

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.079
around killing other people's children

00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:45.519
but

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:47.040
what you do is add a playground take a

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.800
picture of a kid who's there

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.399
airdrop it to all the phones with like

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:53.199
ambler amber alert please help and then

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:55.040
everyone's like grabbing that kid and

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.040
then you just take one of like just a

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.040
little one a little wee one

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.560
you know what's diabolical about that

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.759
your kids

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.120
you know it's diabolical about that you

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.400
make your kids kill them

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.919
well

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:07.199
i think this is almost worse than that

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:08.640
is that when the second amber alert

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.760
comes for the kid that you took

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.720
everyone's going to ignore it

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.360
matt you're a genius

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.799
that's why i didn't want to unleash that

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:19.360
this kid's [ __ ] oh whichever kid you

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.160

he like he i know he understands when we

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.640
talk i have such a connection with him

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.840
and i've always talked to him like a

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.400
normal person and i was like dude

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.720
no one's going to help you i'm i need

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.159
you to punch her in the face because no

one's going to help you

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.039
and he was just like

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:58.000
okay

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.240
did he suck her i think he ended up like

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.240
just asserting himself more and he put

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.600
him into it he like walked over there

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.679
rolling up his sleeves like yeah all

00:21:05.679 --> 00:21:07.360
right yeah he just hit her with a hard

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.559
no and [ __ ]

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:10.799
dude i mean watching a little boy shove

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:12.640
a little girl out of frustration is so

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.840
funny

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.240
that's crazy

00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:19.600
that's the exact physiological response

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.280
we'll be having could you imagine like

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.559
yelling at another person's child in

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:24.720
that situation though like if i took the

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.400
this is probably the more realistic way

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.320
of being like hey you need to stop

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.320
hitting that's not great don't do that

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.320
yeah i can't imagine being that person

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.320
though i mean dude yeah britney will

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.919
just shut that down immediately yeah i

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.919
have it in me i would never do it i feel

00:21:37.919 --> 00:21:39.919
like there's an honor code

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:41.919
yeah but but then at the same time it's

00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:43.679
like this parent has failed a test that

00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:45.280
i will never forget

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.640
true

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.640
dude i had to break up uh so there was

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.360
uh at the park in my town there was uh

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.960
two little boys got in a fight right

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.240
they were about

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.640
11 years old and it was over the summer

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.080
time and they were both trying to get

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.679
the attention of this little girl that

00:21:59.679 --> 00:22:01.760
was there and it was like

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.440
they're peacocking both of them yeah

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.880
right it was a little black boy and a

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.159
little whiteboard picking up like really

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.760
heavy stuff like this isn't even that

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.080
heavy dude it was like yeah it was like

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.360
it was like a lot of uh you should have

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.400
[ __ ] the winner it started

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.000
dude it started out it was like light

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.159
acrobatic competition yeah i mean a

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:19.440
little bit of a jump i'm jumping with

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.720
both feet

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.159
yeah you know what it was like all of

00:22:22.159 --> 00:22:24.240
that right bad cartwheel

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.760
any bad car wheels a lot of bad

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.200
cartwheels neither one of them

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.480
necessarily could pull up how old are

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.039
they again about 11 years old

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:33.039
damn and they were just [ __ ] like

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:35.360
parkhorn for a bay they were parkour for

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.840
a bay and then they started to uh play

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.120
like shoot

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.600
baskets okay you know they they pulled

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.840
and then was the chick hot

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.559
um let me think

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:48.559
dude i was like she's like a 35 year old

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:49.520
lady

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.280
oh yeah it's cool yeah pull up that's

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.799
that's the weed drink dude yeah that's

00:22:52.799 --> 00:22:53.919
the thing too i was like you know

00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:55.120
watching that it was just like when i

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.880
was a kid would i have been parkour you

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.480
were you went you you time traveled yeah

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.440
i tried to try to see what was up uh

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.960
cool did you throw any tricks down for

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.400
her in the moment

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.840
you told me you wouldn't you would have

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.159
busted a 360. i was like i was like

00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:09.840
watching doing a human flag the whole

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.880
time just like yeah yeah

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.159
you would have jumped up and did like a

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:17.120
heel grab off a big rocker

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.120
i could see that how would you done for

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.200
her aerially what would you have done go

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.559
back i would probably like one of those

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:24.000
things where you jump over something and

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.720
bring your feet over with you you know

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.080
just one of those i would give her one

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.600
of my letters yeah in case she has

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.200
friends or whatever if it required any

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.679
more than that

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.480
no i saw him

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.000
i'm going to try that on my wife yeah

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.360
see that still gets her going do some

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.720
acrobatics just [ __ ] like hopper

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.159
trash cans

00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:43.360
yeah

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.679
you will be surprised yeah

00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:47.520
oh she would love it dude absolutely i

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.799
actually thought about that today that's

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:50.880
that's a thing i take that's a that's a

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.880
behavior i exhibit i would say would

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.320
again i'm not trying to steal spectrum

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.720
valor but like today so i either i need

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.880
to go back to my car and it's like a a

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.559
wall that starts off as like probably

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:02.960
like five feet high that slowly winds

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.039
down to like a two foot wall and then

00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:06.240
there's like an entrance you can walk up

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.600
like a little driveway this is the place

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.559
here

00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:09.520
and i was like i didn't feel like

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.960
walking all the way around so i did like

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.760
a mid-range spaz jump

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.360
up like on the two-foot section just

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.120
jumped up and i'm like dude

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.760
yeah my jumps are more like bunny hops

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.520
where i'll like bring up a lead leg and

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.120
then jump with the back foot dude

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.480
there's people that stopped

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.760
there's people that are like i'll just

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.840
walk around like i always if i have like

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.880
if there's something there's an

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.960
opportunity for me to do like a minor

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.440
jump i take it every time oh yeah i mean

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.480
why not

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.279
dude

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:40.559
i just thought about that i'm like [ __ ]

00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:41.679
does this look weird like i have like

00:24:41.679 --> 00:24:43.520
gray hair and i'm like jumping up a wall

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.880
do i still tell you what the [ __ ]

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.840
you know when i walk by and like

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.000
sometimes i'll see a sign for a store

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.600
and i look at him like i bet they

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.440
believe they put that out of human reach

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.039
yeah but you're a freak dude that we saw

00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:58.080
last week your head could hit the

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.039
ceiling

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:01.120
he was nuts that was by the way i

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.360
weighed myself i was 200 pounds really

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.480
yeah and i realized i'm a little

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.520
overweight

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.440
and that's probably why my head didn't

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.440
go completely you're 200 pounds right

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.960
now

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.640
i sort of got either his scales broker

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.080
and he has bones of like [ __ ]

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.559
complete steel that's nuts

00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:18.480
you bulk like 30 pounds i hate it but he

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.840
never looks as much you're like you're

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.240
maybe 180 he always weighs 20 pounds so

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.120
much more jacked up top it's crazy true

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.200
yeah this is such a this is a new level

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.440
that's yeah no well 200 pounds i mean

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.279
that's like so yeah i realized that like

00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:32.960
i need to get down so i can get my hops

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.840
up

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.600
yeah yeah i need to i need to oh by the

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.840
way so i busted my damn league i never

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.360
told you i never go ahead go ahead i

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.559
never told the whole reason i talked

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:43.679
about the sprinklers but go ahead okay

00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:44.400
so

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.600
uh

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.880
yeah all right

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.840
so uh

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.360
so these so these little boys got into a

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.360
little scuffle at this park right

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.400
and the little white boy he went and

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.200
told his mom because his mom was there

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.320
they were there for like little league

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.840
games so that's why his family was there

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.200
in the first place his little brother

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.120
was playing so he you think his dad was

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.960
like go show him charles

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.000
charles

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.360
he's about to sneak up on that white

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.240
lady

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.600
was that a white girl or a black chick

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.120
it was a white girl

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.039
it was a little charles dad was like he

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:16.000
probably sat on the 88 text he was like

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.120
charles

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.960
charles get out of the game my son's

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.760
leaving the game dude so the mom came

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.919
over right do dude pulling your son out

00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:26.320
of a baseball game

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.760
so that he could

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.080
prevent an interracial

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.480
between 11 year olds go seduce that

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.559
woman charles

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.080
honey there was a problem i took care of

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.600
it don't worry

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.039
yeah dude that's what the position of

00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:41.440
shortstop and baseball is probably for

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.320
some made up [ __ ]

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.600
like nobody yeah keep an extra guy on

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.760
the field in case a black boy talks to a

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.480
teenage girl

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.240
i don't want any hollering no hollering

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.000
over my [ __ ] watch

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.200
what if he came out and just trying to

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.679
field him with the gloves

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:00.880
the only reason the shortstop is because

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.840
the umpire is busy

00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:06.559
the umpire hired shortstops to get the

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:08.880
[ __ ] dude how dumb are [ __ ] base

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.039
coaches we had like a first base and a

00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:12.480
third base coach i would just stand

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.159
right in the line of fire for like five

00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:15.360
hours a day

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.559
it's so exciting if you're that you

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:17.840
could just get whacked with the [ __ ]

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.880
baseball

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.480
man i mean i guess everyone on the field

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.919
can also get whacked but there's so

00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:23.760
little houses is every third base coast

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.799
just like a faded glory like base runner

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.159
you know what i mean like he used to

00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:29.520
have it and then like maybe he had like

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.200
a knee surgery now he's just like yeah i

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.799
know come on man everyone knows that he

00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:35.360
knows what's up is that every base coach

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.279
yeah you're running too wide like

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:39.279
there's no way you're in college like if

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:41.279
i really do great with this organization

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:43.279
when i get when i graduate maybe i can

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:44.960
look for a pro team to be a base coach

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.000
there's no one thing i think it's just

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.240
like a bored alcoholic

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.760
i think that's all it is

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.600
some guys like drinking is fun but i'd

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.039
like to do something else too you ever

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:54.559
see those people that are like on the

00:27:54.559 --> 00:27:56.559
sports team but they're only the manager

00:27:56.559 --> 00:27:57.840
like they're the sports team yeah in

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.960
high school like yeah that's a base

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.600
coach that's like in in college he would

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.360
say yeah yeah base coasters are always

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.600
like just something like grizzled dead

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.120
yeah i think a lot of managers become

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.440
like team trainers yeah dude if you

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.120
[ __ ] look at a clipboard long enough

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.880
you become a gr you look like a grizzle

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.559
you don't have any grip yeah but they're

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:16.080
just doing it they're all no way they're

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.480
always fresh with like that short comb

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.720
over haircut and like very fresh cats

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.279
basketball no flip the baseball the

00:28:25.279 --> 00:28:27.200
baseball managers i dude i mean i

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.640
haven't circled the bases that many

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.399
times since i stunk it back

00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:32.080
but every time i saw the third base

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.000
coach it would be like fat someone's fat

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.279
dad i never learned how to catch a

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:37.679
baseball without couchsurfing

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:38.799
dude

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:41.120
it's a the setup is like a pullover like

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.520
windbreaker and then shorts no could you

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.960
then fat red leg could you feel the

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.799
ground ball were you were you i was

00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:48.799
nothing to get by my glove i'll say that

00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:50.720
i just couldn't throw or hit that's what

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.640
spooked me and i was slow so i filled in

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.480
the ground ball spooked you yeah that's

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.159
what spooked me too

00:28:56.159 --> 00:28:58.399
the fear of the fear of not making a

00:28:58.399 --> 00:29:00.000
catch prevented me from ever getting

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.600
good at catching that was that was me

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.200
with throwing i would try to i was

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.960
second base i was so close to first base

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.200
i'm like i can't rip it that hard i'd

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.960
end up soft throwing it every time it

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.399
was embarrassing dude i only i've only

00:29:10.399 --> 00:29:11.600
been invited to play softball as an

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.520
adult one time and i said yes and for

in the process of setting up

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.240
sick plans

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.799

month bring it to me let me know what it

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.760
is we'll brainstorm and have it so

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.360
everyone gets the net and like oh here's

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.600
what we're doing like day trip to the

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.840
beach everyone rents a hotel room a year

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.520
a year in advance and then it's like one

everyone goes down i'm gonna really

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.440

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.080
like a real sick once a month jamboree

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.520
that would be pretty sick yeah and see

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.760
how big i can get it i think it's not

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.279
like a competitive thing but i think

00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:06.799
like every dude should be like trying to

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:08.720
contribute to that kind of thing yes

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.159
exactly maybe it is kind of not

00:30:10.159 --> 00:30:12.240
competitive but like you do want to be

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.320
like this is pretty fun right

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.559
dude i i haven't done that like i have

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:18.799

00:30:24.399 --> 00:30:26.000
it's going to be forever yeah but my

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.440
wife likes to be out and do stuff and

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.039

00:30:29.039 --> 00:30:30.399
like damn that was the funniest [ __ ]

00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:31.840
thing why did i not do that more this is

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.679
also too if you're living yeah because

00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:34.720
you're not taking if you're not doing

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.960
that you're not taking any risks either

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.919
you know you're not you're not putting

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.039
yourself out there because any time

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:40.720
you're like it was pretty fun right

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.840
that's because you put something

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.200
personal out there that you enjoy

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.559
engaging it's like showing someone a

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:35.919
what happens when you get to be our ages

00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:37.440
like you've been working for so long

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.919
you've gone to so many like

00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:42.480
obligatory events for like work that

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.000
like you can't even imagine a gathering

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.159
being fun that's that's kind of like

00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:48.240
where the rut that i grew into like i

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.120
were ready to go

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.440
there's just like a world of fat black

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.240
kids that just lay face down and they're

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.480
like the inch of sprinkler water as it

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.640
moves from place to place

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.640
non-stop and they just kick and thrash

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.880
for like eight hours it's crazy wow

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.720
their ass their entire asses out of

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.640
their shorts

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.679
it's so crazy

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.799
it's just like a fat black kid in

00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:05.440
[ __ ] socks and like sweatshirts with

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.600
half his ass hanging out

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.159
[ __ ] flapping his feet as hard as he

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:10.960
can

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.800
it's like a skinny cousin jumping over

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.280
him time to time it's so funny

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.919
it's so funny

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.320
yeah oh and they just dismissed that

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.599
like that didn't count and i was like

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:25.280
okay yeah that's fine

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.399
well i mean

00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:28.079
you

00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:30.000
you you did just nick something that

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.440
could have counted though because there

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.159
is also a whole [ __ ] legion of fat

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.320
black kids that wear shorts all winter

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.000
true mm-hmm you could hit you could have

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.359
hit him with those true and they

00:34:39.359 --> 00:34:40.480
probably thought you were as soon as you

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.000
said fat black kids you're like oh [ __ ]

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.960
he's gonna hit us with the shorts

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.560
and then you were like laying in the

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.119
sprinkler like it's summertime you know

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:50.399
there's a lot of contrasting things that

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:51.679
you can work with they just they did

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:52.960
they i don't know how i don't know how

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.320
they just somehow steered me away from

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.839
that because i was making a very good

00:34:55.839 --> 00:34:57.440
point you weren't wrong but i feel like

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.000
they fall under the umbrella of fat kids

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.680
that wear shorts all women like they're

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.599
like they're like a you know a little

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:05.040
that's the real time to show that's the

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.480
yeah yeah yeah that's the real time of

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.119
shine in the winter time yeah that's uh

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:10.720
i don't know i feel like eventually like

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.720
black dudes are gonna start just like

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.000
take like you know china if like they

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.200
think you have kova they take you and

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.119
put you in a room i think those fat

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:18.400
black dudes with shorts on in the winter

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.320
are going to start getting like chinese

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.240
communist style like taken and putting

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.839
away oh they would love that so much

00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:25.920
just to be taken away by the by the ch

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.720
by any asian if any asian people took

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.400
them no i'm saying like just black dudes

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.320
to do this like dude what the [ __ ] you

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.920
can't you cannot be point they can't

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.760
know that we're not that cold do you

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.599
think what you think it's a lie

00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:39.040
dudes are gonna swoop them up and sell

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.560
them to the chinese no i think they're

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.160
just gonna take them in so that way

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.280
there's never if they're like white

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.960
people don't get cold i can't be like

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.040
what about [ __ ] that guy yeah in a

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.440
[ __ ] like vest a shirt like a like a

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.359
short vest in shorts

00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:52.400
i'm sorry i was trying to make a

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.960
connection between the idea of like

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.560
scooping up fat black kids because they

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.920
don't get cold and uh the transatlantic

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.040
slave trade

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.760
i apologize

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.800
true yeah

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.240
like it's a celebration it's a slippery

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.920
slope but if you look at it from the

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.079
perspective of the fact that africans

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:12.240
were selling africans it's like why were

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.599
they selling those africans

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.720
do you know what i mean is this an

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.400
unexplored question or is this already

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.599
in books look i mean they're it's in

00:36:19.599 --> 00:36:21.280
books

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.860
that didn't happen by the way

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.300
[Laughter]

00:36:29.599 --> 00:36:31.280
what happened was that africa went to

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.880
ireland and took the slaves

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.920
oh man i just started thinking about and

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.520
again there's nothing funny to talk

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.680
about american slavery what i started

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.000
thinking about was uh like when anime

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.680
blacks were back during slave time that

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.560
must've been crazy that's what i'm

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.079
saying you didn't know what anime was

00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:52.160
but it was all there

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.880
it was oh dude

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:59.590
[Laughter]

00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:10.560

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.839

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.750
[Laughter]

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.880
hoeing yeah if they were pulling

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.079
something that's probably where anime

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:39.920
got it from you got it from

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.839
how powerful sleeves look pulling

00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:43.920

zero knowledge

mysterious podcasters going well that

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.200
sounds terrible and you're in

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.720
but you could be like

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.319
get that guy whatever you're identifying

00:42:40.319 --> 00:42:42.079
by their voice and like remove him and

00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:43.280
they'd be filled in with another

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.599
podcaster

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:46.960
and all night long you could just be

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.359
like yo this [ __ ] sucks get that guy

00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:50.560
out of here yeah but imagine being

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.640
around cutthroat podcasters all night

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.160

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.599
they're behind they're like in a wall

00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:59.359
just potting their hearts contained

00:42:59.359 --> 00:43:02.880
they're both in the tube they're both

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.880
that's dark wow it's a terrible idea

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.800
actually man to be eating and hearing a

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.960
[ __ ] live podcast

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.280
that'd be so awful and like on the

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.359
podcast everybody's trying to stay on

00:43:13.359 --> 00:43:16.480
the podcast yeah that's all that would

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.640
sound awful

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.560
yeah yeah you have to get some subject

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.839
matter

00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:23.119
like if i was going to have to do a

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:24.560
podcast in a restaurant i would do

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.520
murder mystery easy

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.800
that would be that i mean that's easy

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.000
that's i'll just make it up that's so

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.400
obvious i might start making it up

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.280
make a mistake

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.160
mystery and then oh you came in there

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.920
there was another that knife with blood

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.920
on it yeah yeah but what you didn't know

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.760

days beforehand and

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.520
yeah you could do that for five hours a

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.760
night yeah just probably making fake

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.480
ones they probably do that on lifetime

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.480
oh just make up true story yeah true

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.440
crime

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.880

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.800
just everyone's mind's going like dad's

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.160

long yeah just out there running just

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.119
being a [ __ ] spaz not thinking right

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.880
yeah learning fashion de-escalating

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.000

won't get socked at a baseball game i

00:51:38.079 --> 00:51:39.599
think i figured out that i unlocked that

00:51:39.599 --> 00:51:41.599
level of life yeah it's like i know how

00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:42.800
to go to these things and not get

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.559
[ __ ] socks it's one of the more low

00:51:44.559 --> 00:51:47.760
probability outcomes for me yeah

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.520
yeah exactly at least i wouldn't have

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.040
been the aggressor in the situation i

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.319
don't i don't think i could say the same

00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:53.839
thing guys but you might get stopped

00:51:53.839 --> 00:51:55.440
yeah yeah yeah i had that yeah but you

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.000

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.680
reverse it and then you'll like then

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.040

then beat up their dad you know what i'm

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.800
thinking about doing because obviously

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.200
this is what i'm i'm afraid of

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.359
to be in the right you have to like they

00:52:17.359 --> 00:52:18.480
clearly have to start the fight so

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.599
they're probably going to get a free

00:52:19.599 --> 00:52:20.559
shot

00:52:20.559 --> 00:52:24.000
and you have to defend it right true i

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.760
i know that i'm a spaz and i could

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.520
probably i would probably absorb the

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.720
first one

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.640
and i don't want to do that

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.720
so i'm thinking that like in a situation

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.079
where it's like getting intense i might

00:52:34.079 --> 00:52:36.720
like demonstrate martial arts i might do

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.480
a demonstration there was a step-by-step

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.920
where cody like kicked

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.520
a vending machine and it was just like

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.559
that's all i need to do i'm just going

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:44.079
to smash a vending machine with spin

00:52:44.079 --> 00:52:45.760
kick cody kicked the hole in a what a

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.839
vending machine nobody told oh step by

00:52:47.839 --> 00:52:49.280
step okay yeah yeah i thought you meant

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.280
like youtube step by step tutorial no i

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.559
don't know how to do that you meant the

00:52:52.559 --> 00:52:54.000
show step by step no there was

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.440
everything that was going on with cody's

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.440
how to kick through it

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.119
all right i'll put it up

00:52:59.119 --> 00:53:01.440
i'll make it let's [ __ ] with that

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.800
uh yeah

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.319
yeah i don't i don't want to i don't

00:53:04.319 --> 00:53:05.680
want to have to give up a free shot so

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.960
i'm going to demonstrate something real

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.880
quick a little move that's not about it

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.559
it's like if you still want to go

00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:12.319
tell me when we start

00:53:12.319 --> 00:53:14.559
yeah that's that you'd win i mean that

00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:17.440
would win in court for sure and i would

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.040
definitely crush the dude also in line

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.720
at prezel factory dude i almost had

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.200
those i almost had to [ __ ] up a dad at

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.079
that same park uh possibly that same

00:53:26.079 --> 00:53:28.880
summer really yeah he hit somebody that

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.280
this guy he was also his his kid was

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.119
also there for baseball yeah there for

00:53:33.119 --> 00:53:34.640
baseball he also had another kid that

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.440
was like running around with this little

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.960
actually no where are we at we had an

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.200
hour

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.400
all right yeah

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.359
yeah so he was gonna be a nice

00:53:41.359 --> 00:53:42.880
cliffhanger yeah

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:43.680
so

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.800
his kid was running around with some

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.640
little riff raff and they [ __ ] stole

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.079
my basketball

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:50.880
and like i had a very like i [ __ ]

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.760
drew in like a brown color on my

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.599
basketball yeah but my name and stuff so

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:56.880
you have to look at it in a certain

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.720
angle to even see that it's there yeah

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.400
so these [ __ ] stole my basketball and

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.480
i went and found them with my basketball

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.160
and i made them give me my basketball

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.000
back course and he was the only person

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.400
with a dad nearby so

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.960
somebody went and told his dad yeah and

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.960
then his dad came over

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.240
and was like

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.760
like he came over instantly aggressing

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.599
towards me which i can only imagine like

00:54:17.599 --> 00:54:19.280
that kid went and told him that an adult

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.119
was aggressing them yeah so he came over

00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:22.559
with the proper energy i'm not i don't i

00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:23.599
don't even feel like you're sure that

00:54:23.599 --> 00:54:25.200
wrong like if he would have came over

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.480
any less than that he would have been a

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.400
[ __ ] yeah like excuse me did you snatch

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.200
my child's basketball basically and so i

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.480
was like they stole my basketball and

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:35.680
he was he said something about my son

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.119
didn't steal your basketball i was like

00:54:37.119 --> 00:54:39.920
i didn't say your son i said they yeah

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.240
they stole my basketball this is my

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.400
basketball they had and where we were we

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.079
were way far away because i had to track

00:54:46.079 --> 00:54:47.599
them down yeah yeah and way far away

00:54:47.599 --> 00:54:48.799
from the basketball courts but still at

00:54:48.799 --> 00:54:50.640
the park and then

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.319
uh he was like do we have a problem i

00:54:52.319 --> 00:54:55.200
was like we don't have a problem i have

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.520
my basketball yeah i'm walking away with

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.240
my basketball yeah and if if if this

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.079
isn't going to be the case we'll have a

00:55:02.079 --> 00:55:04.319
problem yeah and then we kind of just

00:55:04.319 --> 00:55:05.680
like stare at each other for a little

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.040
bit because neither one of us could

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.760
break eye contact first

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.760
yeah start dribbling yeah

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.880
yeah

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.640

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.359

listen to him

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.520
do you tend to take on like a more

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.960
masculine voice when you're arguing with

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.839
someone no less because

00:55:55.839 --> 00:55:57.520
i always take moves yeah i always do

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.839
less because that that was when i was

00:55:59.839 --> 00:56:01.760
younger and i had like a chip on my

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.839
shoulder that was the best way to

00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:05.440
escalate the situation if i would just

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.040
