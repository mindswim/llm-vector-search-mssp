00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.180
middle school they separated the math

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.460
classes between a and B don't tell me

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.870

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.500
to us yeah I think math they did reading

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.360
earlier and I remember knowing and I was

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.160
not in the dumb reading class yeah it

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.260
was like that I wasn't like Houston

like you know different levels I got

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.510
pretty high up in reading I was stoked

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.830
and then the math came in I'm like

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.900

and my cousin walked out my cousin got

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.460

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.320
walked out was like oh and I was just

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.970

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.889
is yeah they have an agenda I think

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:15.510

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.370
it's like the prequel to Sex in the City

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:02.200
they went back if you're a true Sex in

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.000
the City fan it's highly problematic

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.130
because they act as if Carrie had a dad

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.690
when in fact she didn't Carrie was

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.280
raised by her mom but in the show Carrie

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.140
she's dad and her mom's dead I wonder

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.920
she's a [ __ ]

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.540

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.120
[ __ ] by a bunch of dudes and then blog

well if you watch the if you watch the

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:26.050
prelude and everyone was like that's

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.720

girlfriend and it was like again highly

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.810
problematic if you're all the hardcore

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.520
Sex and the City fans out there I

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.290

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.350
didn't line it up to the actual plot of

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.150
like technically like the legend of

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.000
Carrie Bradshaw but she in the show

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.230
she's like this little girl in the 80s

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.510
and it shows how like she falls in love

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.550
with shoes falls in love with the city

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:55.450
dude it's so [ __ ] dumb oh just like

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:57.670
and then there was shoes I think she

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.770
walks out it's like a 30-minute segment

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.750
of a girl walking I was like a pair of

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.090

what you worried about well I told you

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:27.130

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:29.410
plot that out back in the back in the

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:36.580
game oh oh

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.580

it's a weird being away rappers of a

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.040
weird endeavor I can't fully get behind

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.360
it

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:34.310
I finished goes to the Oscar on huh feel

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:38.440
like the third time it's a book about

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.059
Carlin podcast about Eastern

00:48:41.059 --> 00:48:43.069
you need to [ __ ] listen to it yeah I

00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:45.919
gotta get into it it is insane how bad

00:48:45.919 --> 00:48:46.400
they were

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.400
how bad both sides were and just like

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.289
like I was telling you you were busy but

00:48:51.289 --> 00:48:55.909
there's one story where there's this you

00:48:55.909 --> 00:48:57.679
had to follow if you were a Soviet

00:48:57.679 --> 00:49:00.039
commander you had to follow every order

00:49:00.039 --> 00:49:03.049
to a tee you couldn't [ __ ] it up at all

00:49:03.049 --> 00:49:06.109
so like if you did it'd kill you Jesus

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:07.789
Christ it's like no matter what the

00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:10.189
order was you had to do it so this one's

00:49:10.189 --> 00:49:12.049
like move your line move the line up

00:49:12.049 --> 00:49:15.289
five kilometers and on a map there's no

00:49:15.289 --> 00:49:17.449
River yeah but now there's a river in

00:49:17.449 --> 00:49:20.089
front of you and he's like all my guys

00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:22.130

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.689
from the steps they've never even seen

00:49:23.689 --> 00:49:27.019
water damn he's like if I if we try to

00:49:27.019 --> 00:49:29.150
cross they're all gonna drown but that's

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:31.489
the order so then he would just send

00:49:31.489 --> 00:49:33.949
them all they would all drown he'd get

00:49:33.949 --> 00:49:35.509
to the other side and be like about

00:49:35.509 --> 00:49:37.969
[ __ ] seven dudes survived and they

00:49:37.969 --> 00:49:39.829
may be like what the [ __ ] happened like

00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:40.819
well they drowned in the river

00:49:40.819 --> 00:49:44.239

but then especially like the stories

00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:53.150

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:55.400

00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:58.640
didn't know they stormed Berlin yeah

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.859
that's where we met them tear flaps

00:50:00.859 --> 00:50:03.019
Russkies came Americans and the Russians

00:50:03.019 --> 00:50:06.919
met in Berlin and his and everybody in

00:50:06.919 --> 00:50:08.419
Berlin was trying to get to the American

00:50:08.419 --> 00:50:09.979
side they're like please let us

00:50:09.979 --> 00:50:11.839
surrender to you guys cuz those guys

00:50:11.839 --> 00:50:15.979
Russkies raping everybody yeah we're and

00:50:15.979 --> 00:50:17.839
it was like they were raping chicks to

00:50:17.839 --> 00:50:20.959
death dude it's [ __ ] queer bunch of

00:50:20.959 --> 00:50:22.969
Russkies in the wild did their Russkies

00:50:22.969 --> 00:50:24.529
that and this it all just happened to

00:50:24.529 --> 00:50:27.619
them the Germans have been doing it for

00:50:27.619 --> 00:50:28.159
years

00:50:28.159 --> 00:50:29.900
so on through Russia and a little array

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.569
of [ __ ] every atrocity imaginable

00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:34.579
what so then was it a beef with the

00:50:34.579 --> 00:50:37.699
[ __ ] Russkies well the Russians I

00:50:37.699 --> 00:50:39.919
mean it was all racial they were like

00:50:39.919 --> 00:50:42.319
people aren't Aryan yeah they're the

00:50:42.319 --> 00:50:44.959
hordes from Asia it's really like like

00:50:44.959 --> 00:50:46.939
they're not human so any war crime you

00:50:46.939 --> 00:50:50.199
commit is not a crime Kent so risky yeah

00:50:50.199 --> 00:50:52.880
so everything everything was legal like

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.360
you could just

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.250
it was not you do every so the Russkies

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:57.420
were just like oh yeah

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:18.210
end of it is like an entire population

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:21.180

cook yeah he uh but yeah there's stories

00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:14.380
that are just like there's one that's

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:17.349
sick it's like this is in Berlin like

00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:18.849
right before the Soviets are coming and

00:58:18.849 --> 00:58:20.650
everybody the story is like everybody on

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:23.230
this trolley was like panicking and like

00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:25.059

[ __ ] up he's like if they do half of

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.039
what we did to them we are [ __ ] so you

better fight to the [ __ ] death today

00:58:44.049 --> 00:58:46.960
oh when they came in yeah let's do that

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.730
like the most why they do that like a

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:51.900
football team like the more tang

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:56.319
Buckeyes yeah cuz at the end they were

00:58:56.319 --> 00:58:59.589
using like boys and old men to fight you

00:58:59.589 --> 00:59:00.970
just [ __ ] Soviets they're like we got

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:02.799
to use everything we got there's so many

00:59:02.799 --> 00:59:05.109
Rooskies uh there's a lot of Rooskies

00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:08.140
and those boys were eager to get in

00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:08.529
there

00:59:08.529 --> 00:59:12.130
yeah because the and also the Soviets

00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:13.750
were using like they were using

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:16.029
everybody so this is convicts this is

00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:17.890
[ __ ] they freed everybody everyone's

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:19.690
just like you're gonna grunt dude go

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:21.880
nuts yeah these are the worst people in

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:25.599
the world yeah but it's also it's people

00:59:25.599 --> 00:59:27.180
that committed the worst atrocities

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:28.630
fighting each other

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:30.519
yeah so then when atrocities happened to

00:59:30.519 --> 00:59:33.700
them it's like but you still you still

00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.920
like there's still sympathy because it's

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.720
so horrible for either side like

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.220
whoever's getting victimized it's like

00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:42.609
Jesus Christ the Nazis

00:59:42.609 --> 00:59:45.880
raped yeah yes even if you just stop at

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.319
a tough ticket the poll from the deli

00:59:47.319 --> 00:59:49.809
counter but it is like because all these

00:59:49.809 --> 00:59:51.369
people in Berlin were like hell yeah

00:59:51.369 --> 00:59:52.930

00:59:55.749 --> 00:59:59.499
yeah then when it comes back to you well

00:59:59.499 --> 01:00:02.049

01:00:03.279 --> 01:00:04.660
from everyday feminism where they're

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.549
trying to say that like Latin ex

01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:08.019
countries they're like rape culture

01:00:08.019 --> 01:00:11.589
stems directly from colonial Europeans

01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:13.299
it was just like I'm not reading that

01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:19.720
to like gut virgins and sacrifice them

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.489

01:00:21.489 --> 01:00:23.140
[ __ ] clue about rape and they saw

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.339

01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:33.489
learned there are there are stories

01:00:33.489 --> 01:00:35.859
though of like especially in Africa

01:00:35.859 --> 01:00:39.670

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.170
I don't know if you know about Liberia

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:43.630

01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:44.980
I've heard like it's like dude their

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.039

01:00:47.039 --> 01:00:49.420
capitals Monrovia after president my

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:51.339
flag is just like the blue lives matter

01:00:51.339 --> 01:00:54.880

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.049
instead of 50 gotcha

01:00:56.049 --> 01:00:59.220
same exact American flag yeah one star

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.660

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:04.450
slavery from us oh there are a bunch of

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:06.640

stories of like like in Sarajevo they

01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:22.030
they assassinated the German the guy who

01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:24.580

executed they they assassinate him and

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.210
then the way the Nazis responded was

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:30.760
they hung like a thousand people they

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.160

interest they were fighting over back

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.680
then I know now like it's oil and all

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.500

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.210

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:51.850
German is but he was Volkswagen - it's

01:04:51.850 --> 01:04:53.650
something like free land

01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:57.520
yeah like Leoben space like living space

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.560
hmm and well they wanted to eat it

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.180
Russia was big as Fox they're like well

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:02.740
no this was Germany they were trying to

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.420
they were trying to take over the world

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.430
yeah they're like the the Aryan people

01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:08.290

01:05:08.290 --> 01:05:10.620
breathe everybody over here is our slave

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.060
everybody on the West they're gonna join

01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:16.180
us like it was oh I got you there's

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.290
basically like they're just trying to

01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:18.610
invade everything and eventually this

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:20.290
was right in world war ii was when oil

01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:22.780
became massive mm-hmm so the Germans

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:23.680
were trying to work their way down to

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.220
the middle east to get all the oil Wow

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.340
so that was the plan it was like

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:32.080
everyone down through like Greece get

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.700
into like Turkey that's why they were

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.670
also in North North Africa they're all

01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:37.780
trying to work their way to the middle

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.700
there's gonna bait everyone be like

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:40.960
white people are the best

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.060
hit the [ __ ] Africa take all the oil

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.100
in the Middle East and then just be the

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.460
[ __ ] oligarchs to the world yeah the

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.440
Rooskies were like nah RUC's are like

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.970
that but then towards the ends like

01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:57.010
we're [ __ ] white we're not a bunch of

01:05:57.010 --> 01:05:58.600
people to prove we're [ __ ] white they

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.490
we're not [ __ ] Asian and then yeah

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:01.930
and but then the Germans at the end

01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:03.400
tried to flip it tried to like make

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.680
history like we were trying to protect

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.920
the West from the Soviets like that was

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:12.340
our goal did some other things about the

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:16.270
Jews they were Soviets no that was the

01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:18.490
other thing they thought that Bolshevism

01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:21.100
was like a Jewish plan another Soviet

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:21.630
things

01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:23.549
yeah do they think that Hitler would be

01:06:23.549 --> 01:06:27.230
like yeah enemies are definitely Jews -

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:29.579
yeah he was pushing that from early on

01:06:29.579 --> 01:06:31.950
he was like let's go uh burn down the

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:34.589
stairs well that was because he was a

01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:38.039
soldier in World War one he he was

01:06:38.039 --> 01:06:39.900

like a good World War one vet I mean he

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.750
probably added that she after after the

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:47.849
fact because he controlled you know the

01:06:47.849 --> 01:06:50.849
narrative but uh when they lost World
