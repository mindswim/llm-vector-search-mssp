probably triggering autophagy

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.280
all throughout your whole body cellular

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.960

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.520

i listened to a commercial for it and it

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.360
was like first of all this

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.560
they acted like it was like some like

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.759
interruption from the government it was

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.400
just a paid commercial it was like

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.000

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.160
matrix text though it was like

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.440
this just in from the cdc the vaccine is

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.720
safe and also the first person to take

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.199
it was an

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.440
80 year old lady from england and she's

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.800

90 year old lady from england and she's

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.080
fine it's kind of a risk

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.639
by them to be like dude it's a [ __ ]

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.919
because she could definitely die

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.199
regardless it's a piano

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.680

what i was like dude i have to fight you

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.920
well someone psyop chefs into thinking

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.360
they're like the leader of like a

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.399
almost like paramilitary environment

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:47.760
in a kitchen if you're in a kitchen it's

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.200
like this is like basically a military

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.240
environment

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.920
it's like no it's called everyone being

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.440
high on cocaine at once

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.720
yeah the restaurant owners come in and

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.240
he was a juggalo too the guy who called

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.720
me

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.720
he was a little short fat juggalo and he

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.640
was like i would i mean i would have

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.959
laid on him and murdered him but he now

00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:08.399
he called my bluff dude

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.560
you knew i wasn't gonna do [ __ ] yeah

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.720
yeah you know defend the pecking order

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.079
yeah usually the pecking order of a

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:16.160
restaurant is the owner comes in

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.920
and just like absolutely berates the

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.519
chef yeah sits in his office

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:21.760
does nothing yeah he comes in he's like

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.360
why is my stupid business eyeopener

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.880
failing it's all of your fault chef and

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.760
the chef's like

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.200
i'm too hungover to deal with this and

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.640
he takes it out on the sous chef but

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.920
then ultimately takes it out on the

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.640
dishwasher

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.720
dishwasher is called a fat [ __ ] and

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.160
also uh do you guys have any mexi

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.640

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.399

the rest no you're like a day walker you

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.279

shift in and out amongst the lads and

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.440

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.640
workers there like that

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.480

have a kid

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.200

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.320
ignore it

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.919
wait till it's like 17 16 and then start

00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:48.720
a family because then

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.160

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.200
when you're ready be like hey

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.520
build it up start your real family

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.120
what's up your real family when you're

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.799
like a good family 30 but

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:16.080
this happens often by the way

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.679
it's so sad yeah i thought about it

00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:19.200
today i'm like man it's so nice i'm like

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.960
that must be awesome for people who have

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.240
a kid when they're like seven i'm like

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.520
oh actually no that's not all that's

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.039
yeah awesomeness

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:27.280
but in terms of convenience boy it is

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.880
interesting to see like with a young

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.400
mother and like

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.760
their kid they just become like friends

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.919
yeah or friend of mine yeah yeah or

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:37.120
friends or friends eventually for

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.080
enemies for sure

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.919
that's how it always ends you and me are

00:20:39.919 --> 00:20:41.520
gonna end you think for enemies absolute

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.240
enemies dude

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.679
no friend of mine no we're gonna be

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:45.360
enemies you think that would be i've

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.720
wondered about that what would be the

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.520
thing

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.799
that's what he does yeah that could

00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:50.799
cause catapult and something i believe

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:52.080
probably you going behind my back

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.080
telling lies again true i thought about

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:54.799
i was like i could

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:56.720
steal all the t-shirt money i'm like

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.679
that would spoil things

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.559
that would really yeah you could keep

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:03.919
that's why i always lay i have a

00:21:03.919 --> 00:21:04.640
criminal's mind

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.880
i have a criminal's mind dude dude i was

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.559
i like everything i would not notice

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:10.320
oh you could keep it for months my

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.600
problem is i won't do it i'm an honest

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.799
man with a criminal's mind

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:14.240
one day i'd be like are we still selling

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.360
t-shirts oh yeah and you'd be like

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.960

specifically just in case i make a

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.000
mistake

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.280
so it's like that way i put everything

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.120
out there but dude i like

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.799

all but i'm telling you [ __ ] crazy if

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:30.960
you were

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.799
that would be so [ __ ] funny but it is

00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:34.640
how it happens like not with

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.080

like and then they lost all their money

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.000
it's like how

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.600

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.280
someone and we're like watch this

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.640

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.240
kind of drain you out of fees and [ __ ]

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.280
and you're like by the time you get yo

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.120

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.679
it'd be pretty tight i'd respect it i'd

00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:03.840
probably keep it moving i would never

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.440

like an outdoor setup and

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.120

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.760
a place you're going to focus to chow

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.240

on a point and billy doesn't like

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.320
thinking about this but

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.159
part of my personal journey of wellness

00:26:54.159 --> 00:26:55.440
has been recognizing that my entire

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.720
family is autistic

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.120
all 75 of my extended family network

00:26:59.120 --> 00:26:59.919
i've seen it

00:26:59.919 --> 00:27:02.159
i've seen you guys deep in the pool oh

00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:04.559
yeah i've seen it's just a clan of p

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:06.159
there's so many of these [ __ ]

00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:08.480
coming out just jacked and [ __ ] just

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.799
walking around

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:13.360
just like 35 year olds diving cool into

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.279
the pool like doing a cool move

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:18.840
and people be like nice like that was

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.080
sweet

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.880
sweet entry oh yeah it's just like it's

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.320
like people who are like 40 still going

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.840
for the biggest splash they can get

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.559
not non-stop dude yeah big splashes

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:29.360
talking about like

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.640
and then you walk over and there's like

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.240
a conversation about how somebody could

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.559
definitely drop into a half pipe

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:37.120
still or like just something like just

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.799
or the pool between my great face

00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:40.640
my parents house and my uncle's house is

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.399
sea world for just autistic jackasses

00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:46.000
it's just dude just guys that look like

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.320
they're farmers just

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.960
dive into the yes that's the world

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.640
that's the theory like luckily i did

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.360
enough

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.039
uh i smoked enough weed and did enough

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:56.880
mushrooms to realize i was autistic

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.120
so i cured my autism through just like

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.880
non-stop self-inquiry

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.960
you know just like just a lot of stuff a

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.159
lot of the stuff that i've done a lot of

00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:05.600
stuff i learned which you know

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.799
brought me to where i am today but billy

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:10.880
billy i was telling spud billy was just

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.399
like crushed under the weight

00:28:12.399 --> 00:28:13.840
he was he's younger so he got like

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.440
compressed under the weight of like so

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.880
much autism that he's like a little

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.240
autistic diamond he is

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.919
billy is like a perfect little autistic

00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:21.840
diamond dude he's on

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.919
he's unbreakable there's nothing you can

00:28:23.919 --> 00:28:25.360
say to even get in

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.679
at all you can't you can't dude he's

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:28.720
just been compressed

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.559
yeah he's just jacked that he talks

00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:33.600
about hillary clinton all day

00:28:35.919 --> 00:28:38.080
but i was down there i was down there no

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.520
it was just me and him and he was like

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.880
looking at he was trying to

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.159
get something online about it was

00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:43.279
something with work and then he just

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:44.399
picked up the phone

00:28:44.399 --> 00:28:45.440
i heard him talking to somebody he's

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.200
like yeah she [ __ ] erased all her

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.559
emails when they

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:50.799
just went straight to that i was just

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:52.000
laying on the couch like dude who are

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.039
you talking to

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:56.799
my cousin but yeah man

00:28:56.799 --> 00:28:59.600
that's gonna be the uh you know getting

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.320
a groove back

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.679
for our families like just figuring out

00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:03.279
we all have autism and coming to grips

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:03.919
with it yeah

00:29:03.919 --> 00:29:05.440
it's a real thing the ladies don't seem

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.200
to have it it kind of skips them and

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.480
it's kind of they kind of hide it a

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.799
little better but for dudes get autism

00:29:10.799 --> 00:29:12.399
it's like chronovirus for black people

00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:13.919
it just affects us differently dude it

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:16.480
just hits us

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.679
it's true if it's vitamin d what do you

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:21.760
mean chronovirus

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.360
buttfucks black people dude it's all in

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.039
the numbers look

00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:27.600
i'm worried i'm serious i'm gonna stand

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.440
my whole extended family [ __ ] vitamin

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.600
d

00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:32.799
because if you have a lot of melanin

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:34.559
your body doesn't absorb vitamin d well

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:35.440
enough and you get

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.760
you know kobe comes in and [ __ ] jacks

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.520
you up

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.480
so or you know we could believe what the

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.840
media says and just

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.799
it's because all black people are poor

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:48.080
that's how they put it off they're like

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.360
black people are black people are

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.640
suffering from this more it's because

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.480
they're poor and it's like well

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.840
no they can easily control for a

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.000
variable yeah it's probably the you know

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.200
again i mean also lower access to

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.360
healthcare you know yeah but all you

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.120
have to do is control for that variable

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.039
and see like is it from that or is it

00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:06.000
from the vitamin d

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.159
theory i mean dude they could let us

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:09.360
know they could figure these things out

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.720
pretty quickly but you know

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.840
i just want the truth that's all i'm

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.440
saying i'd like to i'm sorry to make you

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.799
uncomfortable in the room dude but you

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:15.279

he was like

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.200
is it like the way

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:47.360
because he's short so he thinks that

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.720
people don't make fun of short people

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.679
when he's around

00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:51.279
the same way white guys don't make fun

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:53.279
of black people when a black guy's in

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:55.279

walking down the street yeah being a

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.880
[ __ ] [ __ ] and it's like

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.799

00:33:59.919 --> 00:34:02.240

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.440
well dude

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.879
it's interesting to like look online and

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:10.560
it's like white people are [ __ ]

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.440
ugly they look like pink pigs it's like

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.000
holy [ __ ]

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.399
i mean i'm reading the book right now

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:20.079
that got uh got kind of slammed

00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:22.000
in the general press but it's it's a

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
[ __ ] what's it called it's about the uh

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.280
the epidemic of teenage and adolescent

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.000
really more so teenage girls who are

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.040
irreversible damage

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.399
it's about girls who are transiting to

00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:34.399
boys yeah and the thing they said they

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:35.520
were like

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.440
typically for student i mean so it's a

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.760
hot book it's in a is it in the erotica

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.159
section

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:43.919
that's as hot as it gets dude yeah every

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:45.599
time i see a chick i'm like yeah

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:47.440
so much hotter with [ __ ] chess think

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.520
of young teen girls being like i'd love

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.760
to pound [ __ ] with a [ __ ]

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.760
they don't get the bottom typically pain

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.119
so this is this is the thesis of the

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:56.720
book they don't get the bottom surgery

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.920
and what they were saying is like you

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.839
know if you follow gender dysphoria

00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:01.200
typically it affects like point one

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.079
percent

00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:05.280
yeah of uh you know of girls sorry

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:11.599
burp if you follow gender dysphoria

00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:14.800
i was driving down here with them

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.760
keeping me out of npr i was driving down

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.280
driving down this migrate like dude i

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.240
don't know if i could listen to the

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.000
economist

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.160
i know i appreciate it i was just joking

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.520
it made me laugh for sure that would

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.560
that would i don't know if i could sit

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.240
here and just be like

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.720
that would have been that's if i hit you

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.160
if i hit you with the gdp

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.480
the market cap of the tech industry and

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.280
the big

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.680
i'm just like oh no you would have went

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.960
red right here

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.320
yeah a little white would have went in

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.480
four

00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:44.560
i didn't have to directions the shades

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.400
on for show you'd have to block that

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:46.880
dude

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.200
but no they uh they were saying that

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.480
they don't

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.560
they're the sunglasses you might have to

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.920
weather here

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.960
i'm gonna hit you with some stats

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.079
just it's too powerful it's

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:03.040
so autistic

00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:07.280
who do you think's got the bug the most

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.599
in your family i think bill

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:12.720
bill might have it by well that was

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.760
funny too because i started thinking

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.880
about my family

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.040
as like an entire ecosystem and i have

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.359
like a wholly autistic family

00:36:19.359 --> 00:36:20.880
so like you know it's like because again

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.320
we all we're all my whole family's on

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.119
the spectrum

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:25.280
uh to be fair my cousin ajax i think has

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.040
the most yeah he's got it he's got the

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:27.520
most

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.119
he's got the really got a decent amount

00:36:29.119 --> 00:36:31.119
he's got the real mccoy no we all i'm

00:36:31.119 --> 00:36:32.240
telling you i think i have the real

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:32.960
mccoy i think

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.359
it's like i'm also a lot of ours is like

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.720
on so there's like you know we have two

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.320
houses i know in my house i think the

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.079
setup is like light autism well

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:41.599
let's say moderate autism let's be

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.280
honest coupled with like very light

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.240
bipolar

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.240
so it's like it's autism that gets

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.000
fueled by manic episodes

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.240
we love business dangerous yeah yeah

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.680
dude

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.920
a lot of million dollars entrepreneurs a

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.800
lot it's just

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.040
autism with light bipolar too yeah so

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.160
it's like you know that's what i'm

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:58.960
rocking

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.800
but dude it's funny because it's like

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.880
yeah so maybe maybe jax has the most

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.880
but our family as a unit other families

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.920
like oh [ __ ]

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.920
that whole family is just an autistic

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.520
family which is pretty i think people

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.640
enjoy us though

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.079
yeah cause i always notice people like i

00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:13.119
would like they would talk about our

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:14.320
family they'd be like

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.160
my customers you guys are and they're

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.599

night i'm still digging into the

00:43:26.319 --> 00:43:28.079
not rome book the debt book and they go

00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:29.599
back through ancient rome and greece and

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:30.720
how like

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.319
that was pretty much the deal you would

00:43:32.319 --> 00:43:34.240
uh they were just people you got

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.119
captured in more

00:43:35.119 --> 00:43:36.960
people were gonna [ __ ] you in the butt

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.240
yeah and then you could slowly start to

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.240
get your way out of being like a slave

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.440
but then they would still like sell

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.640
their ass and it was one of those things

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.680
where it was like

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.280
basically in rome it was like you could

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.720
[ __ ] dudes in the ass but if you got

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.640
[ __ ] they were like

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.359
loser loser they it was kind of one of

00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:52.400
those things they're like i think that

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.280
like is like

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.560
it's for poor people i think that holds

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.319
up in a lot of countries it was trashy

00:43:56.319 --> 00:43:57.599
to get [ __ ] in the butt oh yeah for

00:43:57.599 --> 00:43:57.920
sure

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.680
uncoof it was one of those things that

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.599
like yeah that's probably how they're

00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:02.560
getting [ __ ] in there

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.119
there was like four jobs imagine if you

00:44:05.119 --> 00:44:06.240
could

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.119
totally disassociate like what was going

00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:10.960
on take one in the butt

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.880
through like zero it had no effect on

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.640
you like you weren't like this sucks

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.920
you could just go around take stuff in

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.839
the ass and then gain yeah

00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:20.160
money you get coins whenever you wanted

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.319
true like somebody just tossed one in me

00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:24.240
i would say yes you could get came

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.319
inside of but there was no astro glide

00:44:26.319 --> 00:44:28.400
back then so it was like

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.240
you know it would just be like lamp oil

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.520
i bet there was yeah i bet they had

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.720
something they probably did have some

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.040
stuff

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.800
i mean think of what you would do as

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.079
like a young lad

00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:38.160

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.680
they had olive oil they had stuff they'd

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.520
olive oil they'd drizzle they'd drizzle

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.720
what taking in the keys huge butthole

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.160
like a young greek boy would come

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.760
a lot of greeks would come to rome to

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.680
gain citizenship so you could

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.280
sell yourself into slavery then have one

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.119
of your affluent friends buy you out of

00:45:17.119 --> 00:45:18.480
it but dude like

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.920
the guy could come if you were there for

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.440
like you know say like the dude got like

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:21.920
a

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.400
like his donkey's leg got broken yeah

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.680
your master could be like i'm gonna [ __ ]

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.960
you in the aspect no no no it's just a

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.200
misunderstanding i'm rich

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.200
there's no recourse sure i'm gonna

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.640
[ __ ] kill it they could kill you [ __ ]

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.440
you in the ass

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.520
but a lot of times they would it was

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:36.960
like a citizen you should do a history

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:37.680
podcast

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.280
dude i'm just the history of getting

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.640
[ __ ] in the air i'm just ancient hiss

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.800
i'm strictly ancient history dude

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.760
dude they got into the idea of um free

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.280
peasantry that's what that we're right

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.480
now the people are going to democracy

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.119
republic we're

00:45:49.119 --> 00:45:51.280
in a free peasantry system they figured

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.880
out around the actual age i mean dude

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.160
please stop me if i'm getting too

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:54.960
technical

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.520
but around the actual age about 800 bc

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.359
to 600 a.d

00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:01.280
they started you got some you're in my

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.520
ass right now

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.359
i was like oh i can do it for a couple

00:46:05.359 --> 00:46:07.440
coins

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:11.440
i can let this guy [ __ ] me go ahead

00:46:12.319 --> 00:46:14.000
but the bunch of places all at once kind

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.200
of figured out because really it would

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.880
like you know say like we're a feudal

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.880
society we're obviously the lords these

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.200
are our vassals

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.400
i looked over he's sitting there he's

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.560
like

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.640
so we're lords i say you're the lord i'm

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.680
your vassal

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.920
and then i i vassal out we'll just just

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.880
let's go

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.240
well there was no equality there i'm

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.720
robert true but exactly but there's no

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.359
it was very it was hierarchical all dude

00:46:37.359 --> 00:46:39.040
feelings aside i just care about getting

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.119
accurate to the historical portrait okay

00:46:41.119 --> 00:46:42.560
so it has to be

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.800
i'm robert you're ned fair enough fair

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.240
still it's a vassal relationship this is

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.920
the hound and the mountain

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.280
yeah but we're brothers i want to break

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.119
them down to peasants

00:46:51.119 --> 00:46:53.920
so we could say yeah the mayor could be

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.280
perhaps a little tooth

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.800
and then noah may be a peasant again

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.000
this has nothing to do with you said any

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.079
mean text it could be anyone could be

00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:04.960
yes no you're clearly a peasant so

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.800
they figured so like we were just all we

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.240
would just dominate each other all day

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.119
long and then

00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:11.440
the military was for like noble-born

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.720
something like the noble borns would go

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.520
out and be like

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.359
let's go conquer and they'd like yeah

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:17.119
and like you know fight people on stuff

00:47:17.119 --> 00:47:18.160
and then they figured out they're like

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.880
all right if we give the poor the

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.000
peasants if we give the peasants a

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.359
little bit of land and then give them

00:47:23.359 --> 00:47:25.040
coins and say like hey this is money

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.559
come bring us money you know i think i

00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:27.680
talked about support just bring us a

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.800
little bit of money it's called taxes

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.400
otherwise we'll [ __ ] kill you

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.680
um so then you're working the farm and

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:32.720
they're like hey the farm's kind of

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.160
falling behind you bad crop

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.680
let's get some of those boys going into

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.280
the army we'll give you some money

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.200
so then they figured out they had a free

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.800
peasantry they would

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.200
uh take the farmer's sons and put them

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.079
into war and let

00:47:44.079 --> 00:47:45.440
they let basically the poor people go

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.040
start doing their conquering for them

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.319
and it worked out awesome but the

00:47:48.319 --> 00:47:49.760
problem was in order to conquer need

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.400
more money

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.839
so they would go get mines they would

00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:53.760
take people over get slaves to mine more

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.119
money so they can get more soldiers and

00:47:55.119 --> 00:47:56.240
the whole thing kind of went on and on

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:56.880
and on

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.880
but pretty six that's how we live in a

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.079
free peasantry yeah

00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:01.839
so you free your peasants but then you

00:48:01.839 --> 00:48:03.520
draft all the children and you make it

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.640
you make it like hard for them to kind

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.079
of get ahead but you offer like the make

00:48:06.079 --> 00:48:07.599
sure the military is like a significant

00:48:07.599 --> 00:48:08.960
amount of money just enough

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.480
and you just constantly just keep

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.599
milling people over that's why you can't

00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:12.880
let people get too affluent

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.400
because the military enlistment falls

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.920
off so they do

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.520
they like have documents saying all this

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.520
stuff there was a india

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.680
rome greece dude greece was [ __ ]

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.200
hilarious too because in greece they

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.559
didn't do

00:48:24.559 --> 00:48:26.079
like so like when money first came out

00:48:26.079 --> 00:48:27.359
greeks they didn't you had a farm so

00:48:27.359 --> 00:48:28.319
you're like you saw money and the

00:48:28.319 --> 00:48:29.680
commerce was for kind of peasants you're

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.480
like yo dude

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.880
as an affluent gree apple and greek you

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.240
just trained for the olympics so you

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.680
just like try to get jet you stay on

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.559
your farm like

00:48:36.559 --> 00:48:38.319
naked wrestle yeah you naked wrestle and

00:48:38.319 --> 00:48:39.920
then you would just [ __ ] boys

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.079
like they that was a big rite of passage

00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:43.280
this guy is a paradise

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:49.280
this guy is guy heavy

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.920
argue philosophically and then be like

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.440
let's get one i like that boy i'm gonna

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.880
train him and you were like give your

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.160
you would give this boy everything you

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:56.400
know

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.760
it was like how i approached you open my

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.920
comedy dude i was like i was like i like

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.079
that boy i brought in the young max here

00:49:02.079 --> 00:49:06.079
and i plowed him for sure spots

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.040
i sunk my dong into him deep he had to

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:09.599
dude

00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:12.240
and then he would that would be i mean

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.160
that gets into another thing too of a

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.319
it's called homosexual reproduction so

00:49:16.319 --> 00:49:17.520
there's like you can reproduce with a

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.079
woman

00:49:18.079 --> 00:49:19.760
but your offspring your biological

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.119
offspring is going to be half that woman

00:49:21.119 --> 00:49:22.079
if you want a pure

00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:24.160
son you get you have a man you have a

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.839
young boy in a homosexual relationship

00:49:25.839 --> 00:49:27.520
and you download your entire spirit into

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.640
that person and then that's

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.079
another part of your legacy that's more

00:49:30.079 --> 00:49:31.760
truly did you tell bill of this

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.400
no that was like a tip he was on really

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.160
he was like i mean it doesn't have to be

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.000
he was like it would be cooler if guys

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.240
could just marry other guys

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.440
and reproduce with guys he said that

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.720
it's tough staying in the closet when

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.680
you're autistic dude

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.280
yeah but and it's funny too because he's

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.119
like autistic gay

00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:52.800
he's like he's not doing it because he's

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.480
sexually attracted he's doing it he's

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.240
like because i like being around guys

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.079
for sure for sure it'd be cooler if we

00:49:58.079 --> 00:50:00.960
could just be around each other

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.400
and then just had like you find another

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.000
his i think his explanation

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.839
this is this is war mode listen to it

00:50:05.839 --> 00:50:07.119
yeah he's talking about

00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:09.200
you got to find other guys that you get

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.960
along with like you and me or pals sure

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.800
you and me could have a son

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.400
true an elite son combined autistic and

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.040
drunk

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.359
damn

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.040
that's just unstoppable yeah now he sold

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:23.839
me

00:50:23.839 --> 00:50:25.599
i figured so you could you said you

00:50:25.599 --> 00:50:27.119
could have logistically sound you have a

00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:28.000
traditional

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.160
monogamous heterosexual marriage where

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.040
you both have

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.040
yeah you have a song then two dudes

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.319
could squad up in like a different type

00:50:34.319 --> 00:50:35.520
of arrangement

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.359
that'd be pretty tight two straight guys

00:50:37.359 --> 00:50:39.599
could adopt a kid

00:50:39.599 --> 00:50:41.040
yeah that's actually a good idea and

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.240
then they just go back and forth you can

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:42.880
just chuck and

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:46.000
marry a kid that's awesome you know

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.920
we could fake be gay get married and

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.440
adopt a child well i don't understand

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.960
why you know i mean i don't say anything

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.920
you'd have to be why do you have to be

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.200
gay to adopt a child i think that's

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.640
unfair i think as a heterosexual we

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.160
should be able to have our heterosexual

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.359
christian households

00:50:57.359 --> 00:50:59.119
and then adopt a son together as an end

00:50:59.119 --> 00:51:00.880
we would be the person's guardian and

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.319
they have joint custody almost these are

00:51:02.319 --> 00:51:04.319
basically a barracks

00:51:04.319 --> 00:51:06.400
you and me could move in together yeah

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.920
kill your parents for sure take the

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.119
compound yeah i got to take that over

00:51:09.119 --> 00:51:10.319
for sure you have to poison them for the

00:51:10.319 --> 00:51:10.800
good of the

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.160
poison the well over there i could

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.119
literally put a goat's head in the well

00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:18.160
i'll supply it get a goat's head put it

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:18.800
in the well

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.880
that'll render my sister financially

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.800
insolvent that way you could swoop in

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.200
there

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.280
perfectly she can live that's insane but

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.559
she will be very dependent

00:51:26.559 --> 00:51:29.920
yes i mean she works but yeah

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.200
nothing compared to the coinage we're

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.640
going to be stacking with all these we

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.760
need to start off we need to start a

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:34.880
mint that's the thing we got to start

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.079
making our own coins that was

00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:37.839
that was the big thing you'd start a

00:51:37.839 --> 00:51:39.839
mint you would just go in extract metals

00:51:39.839 --> 00:51:41.040
and then do currency

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.559
and then have those people you paid to

00:51:42.559 --> 00:51:44.079
go take other medals from other people

00:51:44.079 --> 00:51:45.599
make currency get more soldiers get more

00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:46.079
slaves

00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:47.920
so once we've taken out your parents

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.319
yeah and yeah rendered everyone pretty

00:51:50.319 --> 00:51:50.800
weak

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.480
yeah through whatever disease the goat's

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.839
head will inflict maybe

00:51:53.839 --> 00:51:55.200
maybe i can do a bit of an urgency to

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.920
put the goat's head in the pool

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.599
right yeah i don't think it'll be i

00:51:59.599 --> 00:52:01.760
think they won't notice that that's not

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.200
going to stop the cave i'd be tossed in

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.400
the jacket

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.839
that would just be tossed back and forth

00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:08.800
like a pool volleyball

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.319
then we set up a barracks we start

00:52:10.319 --> 00:52:12.960
adopting kids

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.559
bring them in train them up get them

00:52:14.559 --> 00:52:16.240
jacked true get them supple

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.880
yep have our way with him if need be if

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:19.839
need be

00:52:19.839 --> 00:52:22.800
obviously not out of anything other than

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.880
greek philosophy

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.319
respecting western thought

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.839
i just don't want democracy to die yes

00:52:31.839 --> 00:52:32.960
so obviously we're going to

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.400
have sex with the kids we've adopted

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.680
just so they totally understand our

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:36.240
lessons

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.720
yes 100 you got a hammer at home 100

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.599
yeah

00:52:39.599 --> 00:52:40.960
uh and then i don't know where to go

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.400
from there that's probably as far as the

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.119
plan goes

00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:45.359
i think that's what uh the allegory of

00:52:45.359 --> 00:52:46.720
the cave was about

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.359
she was a guy like 69 like can you if a

00:52:49.359 --> 00:52:51.200
hairy butthole is in front of your face

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.880
as you suck your master's dick

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:56.000
can you really see what's happening

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.040
i can't believe people think this

00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.240
podcast sucks are you kidding me come on

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.760

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:05.200
we should [ __ ] kids no we would never

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.319
that's [ __ ] crazy

00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:08.000
yeah dude that was that could have been

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.319
the downfall of uh grease man

00:53:10.319 --> 00:53:12.160
they got too butt friendly the lower the

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.680
lower classes were like we got real

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.160
people

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.680
rising yeah enterprising and doing

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.960
things and the the elites were like

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.599
that's disgusting yeah and just like sat

00:53:21.599 --> 00:53:22.720
around

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.400
kicked some ideas around and then uh the

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.119
romans [ __ ]

00:53:27.359 --> 00:53:31.119

00:54:15.119 --> 00:54:16.480
know the dialogue they took it from the

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:16.880
book

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.240
so i'm listening to this book and i just

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.680
know i can see every scene you're

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.480
watching the movie

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.000
i'm watching the movie while listening

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.599
to the audiobook at night

00:54:23.599 --> 00:54:25.440
it's pretty tight that's [ __ ] awesome

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.599
but it's fiction i didn't know the book

00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:28.640
was fiction

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.960
what it's a it's supposed to be like the

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.319
definitive

00:54:32.319 --> 00:54:34.880
civil war novel i mean it's a novel but

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.160
yeah it's a [ __ ]

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.799
fiction it's like first person from

00:54:38.799 --> 00:54:40.720
every charac from every like historical

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:41.119
figure

00:54:41.119 --> 00:54:43.119
it's just made up you think you think it

00:54:43.119 --> 00:54:44.480
was supplemented this is what they would

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.920
say yeah it definitely was oh but

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:46.960
yeah absolutely of course they're going

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.000
to throw it but it's still like a

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.200
dialogue but

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:51.839
it's almost it reads like a script like

00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:53.680
it reads like

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.440
i don't know but then they just made

00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.280
everybody so like back then you would

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.359
speak like romantically

00:54:59.359 --> 00:55:00.960
probably like yeah that was like how

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.880
they talk back then yeah oh my old

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.880
pete like and i went and it was making

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:19.920
me like because that's how like you'd

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:20.240
read

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.160
you that's true that's how they like

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.280
that's how they wrote

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.440
that's how they like think of in the

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.040
future they look back at us and the way

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.319
we talk we're like yo

00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:30.960
like if they so we're getting a hold of

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.400
their like personal letters and their

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.440
diaries and [ __ ]

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.799
so like their letters back and forth

00:55:34.799 --> 00:55:37.119
they're like dearest robert

00:55:37.119 --> 00:55:40.079
oh dear friend how i've missed you so i

00:55:40.079 --> 00:55:41.680
think about you from time to time

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.760
like stuff like that if they found and

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.359
that's how we just assumed they spoke

00:55:45.359 --> 00:55:47.760
because of their correspondence yeah if

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.400
they found

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.559
our texts oh my god like 100 years from

00:55:50.559 --> 00:55:52.480
now they would be like

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.200
it's so [ __ ] litty right now bro [ __ ]

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:55.920
you

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.040
what like just you know

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.720
it's gonna be it's gonna be horrible

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.839
i've thought about that i wonder if

00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:03.119
their correspondence was a little

00:56:03.119 --> 00:56:04.319
different than how they spoke is what

00:56:04.319 --> 00:56:05.280
i'm saying

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.799
do you think they strictly spoke like we

00:56:06.799 --> 00:56:08.400
don't speak like when they saw each

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:17.839
other yeah

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.720
in the 15th century there was a whole

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.559
art of like making a sick facial

00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:24.000
expression the entire day of just being

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.160
like

00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:28.640
we talked about countenance before dude

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.799
just [ __ ] you would go to the town

00:56:30.799 --> 00:56:32.480
square there's nothing to do at all

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.520
that was the other thing too they used

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.799
to just like run out of money and you're

00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:36.000
like [ __ ]

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.440
all that money's gone and you would just

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.440
sit there and be like

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.200
yeah they got tricked the same way my

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.720
whole family did just a whole town would

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.400
be like ah [ __ ] we're out a wheat they

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.680
took all the wheat well that

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.200
was originally money was for the upper

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.480
class and the way it trickled down to

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.920
lower classes because soldiers

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:51.680
finally started looting once they made a

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.119
lot of money a soldier would conquer

00:56:53.119 --> 00:56:54.480
another like advanced army

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.160
yeah like just like shitty guys would

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.760
get like sweet we have money and just

00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.280
spend it on [ __ ] and that's how like

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.720
they said the money started to circulate

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.760
the population

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.119
wasn't supposed to get to the wasn't

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.960
supposed to get to the lower class

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.960
soldiers by hookers and like beef jerky

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.160
and everyone was like dude we're [ __ ]

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.839
hitting it these are our two main eggs

00:57:09.839 --> 00:57:11.599
that was a medieval rest stop most towns

00:57:11.599 --> 00:57:13.599
was just like here's a here's a slim jim

00:57:13.599 --> 00:57:15.440
and a hand job

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.920
[ __ ] get back out there do what you

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.440
got to do just cutting heads off of

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.880
barbarians oh yeah

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.559
but yeah the civil war that's what it's

00:57:22.559 --> 00:57:24.160
going to be for sure that's what the

they've done they've studied like some

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.400
of the muskets in the i think

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.680
revolutionary war

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.040
and they said a lot of people didn't

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.960
want to like a lot of people fake shot

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.400
and like they would just overstuff them

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.000
and like keep just putting bullets on

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.680
bullets on that that's in a movie

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:28.640

thought i was talking i don't know

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.400
you probably thought you were [ __ ]

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.680
throwing one of the bus dude i would

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.480

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.319
for this spot me

01:00:26.319 --> 01:00:28.319

01:00:28.319 --> 01:00:29.520

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.440
shane oh do you think old winfield's

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.880
over there you're a shame

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.760
your last podcast caught me to the core

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.359
i've been stricken down with the

01:00:37.359 --> 01:00:40.000
melancholy

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.680
i've seen brighter days friend

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.200
i don't know what that was your latest

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.599
electric correspondence cut me down

01:00:47.599 --> 01:00:49.760
damn it but yeah i think most of my

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.119
research has been playing civil war

01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:51.839
video games

01:00:51.839 --> 01:00:53.359
that's that counts it's the only way to

01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:55.040
research properly cal state i gotta put

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.640
myself in the mind of the generals and

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.000
be like what would i do

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.559
oh dude i'm for real seriously you

01:01:00.559 --> 01:01:02.480
should so what you should do is do the

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.559
audio and then overlay it on you playing

01:01:04.559 --> 01:01:05.839
the paddle in the game that'll be pretty

01:01:05.839 --> 01:01:07.040
tight

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.799
i'm just spitballing here yeah true i

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:10.400
would want a video aspect of it

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.079
that would be it you need to see if you

01:01:12.079 --> 01:01:13.839
did a thing over a [ __ ] like

01:01:13.839 --> 01:01:15.599
an age vampire civil war game that would

01:01:15.599 --> 01:01:17.520
be funny even if it was just totally

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.200
unrelated of you just moving pieces

01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:25.599
that would be so alright

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:27.599
um but yeah i think you should do it

01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:29.040
there's a video game dude

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.520
there's a computer game i must get and

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.880
in order for me to get it i would have

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.200
to

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.760
buy a desktop that's like super powerful

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.440
yeah and set up like monitor i just have

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.880
to set up a gaming station

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.440
dude for one game become great dude i

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.240
could become the most elite

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.040
and but it's called war of rights yeah

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.319
it [ __ ] rules

01:01:48.319 --> 01:01:50.799
yeah all right you play as one soldier

01:01:50.799 --> 01:01:52.000
it's multiplayer

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.880
civil war but you have to like soldier

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.000
you play as a guy

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.240
but you have to like dudes like do their

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.319
role yeah like you stand in a line and

01:02:00.319 --> 01:02:02.640
walk and then somebody's like aim

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.559
fire and then like you all march around

01:02:04.559 --> 01:02:06.240
together what there's guys that like

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:06.640
just

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.960
hold the wheel of a cannon and someone's

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.319
like all right two to the left and you

01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:11.920
just sit there

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.960

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.039
gonna show you war of rights please do

01:02:15.039 --> 01:02:16.720
i gotta get in on this you might have

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.400
just nerds that are willing to

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.359
simulate a battle like nobody's yelling

01:02:21.359 --> 01:02:22.720
the n-word

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.160
nobody's although probably if they

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.079
should simulate it if you're the rebels

01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:28.160
if you're the rebels you should to holla

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.200
you think they'll holla you should

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.160
hollow out

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.119
they were gentlemen they probably

01:02:31.119 --> 01:02:32.880
weren't hollering the rebel holla yeah

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.960
you

01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:39.280
there was probably some very very mean

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.240
there were probably some people that

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.559
were unhappy about

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:44.240
dearest margaret you wouldn't believe

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.520

you believe this it just breaks that

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.440
character

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.720
they're [ __ ] letting them fight

01:02:54.799 --> 01:02:56.319

01:02:56.319 --> 01:02:57.839

they no surrender they would yeah they

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.880
would kill they did some [ __ ] up

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.559
things i think if they ran into a

01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:06.880
brigade of buffalo soldiers yeah they'd

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:07.599
take them out

01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:09.839
which you know that's mean that was not

01:03:09.839 --> 01:03:10.880
nice no

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.720

and they like wouldn't scalp them

01:03:35.119 --> 01:03:36.559
