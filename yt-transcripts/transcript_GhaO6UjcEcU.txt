00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.640
gone

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.360
because of everything on television and

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.319
music and

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.879
movies he thinks the skis are gone dude

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.239
really yeah

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.760
they think they've got he's like and

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.200
then i watch bar store and i'm like yes

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.879
dude the skis exist they're right here

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.480
they're still making content oh you

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.840
talking about on tv yeah yeah true that

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.159
is

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.400
it that's broski headquartered dude but

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.200
what used to be

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.760
i think there was a that is broski there

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.360
was a confusion about where like

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.560
because there was the chive i never

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.159
liked the chive and i always kind of

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.959
like

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.560
deflate i always figured those two were

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.160
very similar to the drive and then

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.320
then i'd watch uh like they would just

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.680
release something i'd be like

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.440
oh i don't know yeah i didn't know like

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.120
because i'm like putting like the chive

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.639
thing to it and they they just drop a

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.000
take that i'm like

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.560
yeah now they've tend to backpedal

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.440
slightly lately

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.880

home he's like things are turning around

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.280
i think she's that's what happened with

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.200
that she won bingo was like we're

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.720

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.799
drunk on a bingo win

holding up like 40 bucks left i did it

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.039
yeah bingos for like if you're too

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:06.640
confused about blackjack you're like

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.799
let's play bingo

00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:10.240

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.559
you cheat

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:14.000
yeah you just get a nice advantage at

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.919
the beginning so you don't

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:17.520
so when you get your cards you get 10

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.120
cards but you can use any of them

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.200
at any time so i laid out a couple saw

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.200
with the first number hit

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.280
that's a good spot on this card take

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.640
that but you keep your eye on the other

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.120
ones too

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.720
and if they don't call any numbers of

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.159

00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:33.120
you save the card sure this is a dud i'm

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.559

long 69 session yeah it's just [ __ ]

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.000

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.760
gay union

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.080

by punching them in the dick there has

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.400

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.240
think of him yeah think of any of your

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.160
guys or dads like 10 years from now

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.280
what's running the country dude that's

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.240
insane

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.960
what's what's uh what's biden's like

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.680
drug use

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.640
history trump is substanceless yeah he

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.599
said he didn't do anything

00:51:17.599 --> 00:51:19.520
yeah but trump was definitely on the

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.079
something because he's a spry dude

00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:24.960
and he's a geez yeah wait do you think

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.400
he took like

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.839
like something from his doctor he's

00:51:27.839 --> 00:51:29.359
probably adorable he probably doesn't

00:51:29.359 --> 00:51:30.720
count medicine as she's probably yeah

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.160
it's medicine yeah of course

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.520
yeah it was probably adderall you think

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.400
he was on adderall

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.000
damn i mean honestly i think every

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.599
president should be required to be on

00:51:39.599 --> 00:51:40.079
adderall

00:51:40.079 --> 00:51:41.440
which is impressive considering how

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.520
thick he is that's what i'm saying dude

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.400
i don't know if that thing i don't know

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:44.960
if he was just

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.079
true he might not be on adderall

00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:50.880
i think he was he had to be on something

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.359
i think he's just high tea

00:51:53.359 --> 00:51:55.119
i agree i think he's so high please

00:51:55.119 --> 00:51:56.800
don't let me please don't let me be on

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.240
the side of the argument that's against

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.160
trump being high t

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.480
obviously the guy's high t i think he's

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.400
i think he's just high t high iq and it

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.079
looks like he's on that high iq i think

00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:07.760
he's like 160 probably

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.680
he's slightly lower than jones it's like

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.800
jones is 170.

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.839
trump's 160. but no i don't know i i'm i

00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:14.240
just

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.599
i just miss hearing stuff about my

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:17.440
president dude i feel lost i know

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:18.960
even if it was bad stuff at least i knew

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.000
what was going on is it nice to be able

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.599
to go back to being able to publicly be

00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:23.599
like yo trump [ __ ] ruled

00:52:23.599 --> 00:52:25.359

mean i know it's good it's

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.960
like muscles yeah because we would do it

that's what i got i need that and it was

00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:41.280
the worst because the coaches would be

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.119
like ice baths after practice i'd be

00:56:43.119 --> 00:56:44.960
