00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.680
of the greatest counter punches of all

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.479
time

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.479

historic milestones and unprecedented

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.800
economic success and wealth creation

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.039

i mean this is just a pure personal

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.120
observation that holds no weight at all

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.720
but there are

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.280

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.399
just horns going off people just laying

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:35.920

were apparently tricked into smoking i

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.880

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:43.920

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.880
tumblr and the left and how the internet

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.959
influenced it and it starts out talking

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:44.560
about how like the left

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.639

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:52.639
beyonce saying oprah cried like it was

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.480
the same formula again with hillary

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.040

like the women smoking thing

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.760
he theorized based off freud that humans

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.920
are totally non-rational and emotional

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.760
creatures so if you just like

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.160

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.399
people are going to be like yeah yeah

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:20.079
beyonce's right we need to vote for this

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:21.440
person it makes perfect sense that's

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.800
what [ __ ] uh bill clinton did they

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.480
hire focus groups like what are you guys

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.519
worried about and they're like they hate

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:26.800
all their worries and they just go out

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.959
and say those things so there's no like

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:30.160
that's how they figure all that stuff

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.200
out

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.560
but now they use the internet for it too

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.160
so they can mass pull people and hear

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.360
what people want and just go out and be

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.560
like here's what i'm going to do and

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.240
everyone's like [ __ ] yeah that's awesome

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.079
it's it's what's really crazy the book

00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:41.839
breaks down like when it all started

00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:43.839
like when the internet became just

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:45.760
like mainly mainly like

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.399
well kony in 2012.

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:50.160
that was the first viral video that

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.760
really was like

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.600
the the high wall like the first major

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.839
slacktivism is the term what's coney

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:01.360
coney 2012 was the ugandan warlord that

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.079
had like child soldiers okay yeah yeah

00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:06.959
in 2012 everybody's it was like hashtag

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:09.760
coney 2012 where it was like

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.920
we got to stop this warlord

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.560
just some random [ __ ] guy in uganda

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.639
and the whole west was like we got it we

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:18.399
got to destroy this guy dude that's

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.560
[ __ ] cool and then uh

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.160
it turned out that the guy who made the

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.440
documentary

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.600
lost his [ __ ] and like ended up jerking

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.519
off in public

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:29.680
and then uganda's government was like

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.279
you guys don't understand the situation

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:33.360
with him yeah stay the [ __ ] out of this

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.440
course no idea what you're talking about

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.600
and like so it went from like every

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.839
single person was posting it online it's

00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:42.399
like this virtue signaling [ __ ] like

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:43.920
you remember how i do you even remember

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.680
that i don't remember it was i just

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.839
remember even then being like this is

00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:49.680
ridiculous that these people i didn't

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.440
know what virtue signaling necessarily

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.600
was yeah the fact that just like

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.839
some [ __ ] i knew from high school was

00:14:55.839 --> 00:14:57.920
posting a coney 2012 video on his

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.760
facebook that's crazy like we need to

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.399
stop this guy well it feels good yeah i

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:04.720
used to write for a website this guy

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.160
started the thing i forget what the [ __ ]

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
it was called but the whole point of the

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
website was like

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.839
it was for people to pledge money and

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:13.440
then write on facebook that they pledge

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.279
money to certain causes and within like

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:17.199
months this guy had millions of people

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:18.959
going you could show what you did and

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:20.959
then he just took all that web traffic

00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:22.959
and turned it into like a viral blooper

00:15:22.959 --> 00:15:24.880
site so i still like go under viral

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.959
videos like look at this guy fall on his

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:28.959
nuts on a rail and he took all this like

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:30.880
charity stuff and ported it that's the

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.320
move dude if you want to sell stuff if

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.560
you want to sell stuff to like

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.560
20 to 30 year olds just convince them

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.839
they're like changing the world a little

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:39.360
bit and they'll do they're all [ __ ]

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.600
over it so when when it took a dark turn

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.000
though after coney well after coney

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.920
there was the backlash of like the guy

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.079
got filmed jerking off in public that

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:49.920
directed it stuff and like so people

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.839
like slowly backed off and realized they

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:54.480
were being kind of constable yeah and

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.880
then harambe died

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.959
the girl that was in 2012 uh i think 12

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.880
or 13. what the [ __ ] man i feel like

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.720
i've been living on a rock i'm like i

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.680
thought that was like last year when i

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.199
read that i was like man i feel like i

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:07.680
was just doing material on

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.759
i thought harambe was last year no

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:11.440
harambee was a while ago what the [ __ ]

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.560
it was it was

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.160
it was the next

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.560
dark turn that like slacktivism yeah it

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.920
was kind of the birth of like the

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.040
alt-right

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.680
and 4chan and all this [ __ ] because

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.759
then they just started ironically and

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:26.079
mockingly posting like

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:28.480
r.i.p harambe

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.399
dicks out for harambe yeah like all this

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:32.560
[ __ ] that was um that happened to that

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.720
that dude gaddafi he was like

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.480
he was a villain and then we loved him

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.079
for a while and then he was a villain

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:39.839
again and then we like he was trying to

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:41.440
escape because we basically unleashed

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.959
his whole country on him yeah and we

00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:44.959
drone-striked his convoy and he like ran

00:16:44.959 --> 00:16:46.320
and hid in the sewer and they shoved a

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.759
[ __ ] stick up his ass and killed him

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:49.680
yes like we totally america totally did

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.519
that though i'm sure they're like yeah

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:53.199
yeah terrorism is your fault so

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:54.480
apparently it also it all came from

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.680
syria

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.279
they started unleashing suicide bombs

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.720
and people were just like like they

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.320
haven't they unleashed a suicide bomb on

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.759
reagan and he saw that he's like we're

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:02.720
going in the middle east we're gonna

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.400

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.240
marine base a suicide bomber and reagan

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.000

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.520
and they pulled all the [ __ ] troops

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.559
out he was like i'm not [ __ ] like

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:12.079
that at all and the whole thing just

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.079
went [ __ ] crazy

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:15.439

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.400
a real nightmare over there

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.679
it really sucks to watch those

00:20:15.679 --> 00:20:17.760
documentaries i was loving nicest

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.360
documentaries [ __ ] like that it's just

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.760
like damn i mean dude the idea

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.919
of the suicide bombing is [ __ ] crazy

00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:25.200
i never really thought about where it

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.039
came from and how like some guy just

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:28.880
read the crown he was like cause you're

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.400
not supposed to kill yourself if you're

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.080
a muslim and he's like well you're not

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.440
killing yourself you're sacrificing

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.120
yourself for holy war yeah and they're

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.080
like well you're not supposed to kill

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.360
non-muslims and are you not supposed to

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.559
kill muslims either and they're like

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:39.360
well they're not muslims they're

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.440
infidelity it's like what the [ __ ] and

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.720
then uh

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.960
they usually get kids to do it yeah

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.640
[ __ ] they get the school buses they

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.159
get out of time it started off they got

00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:49.360
the school buses and they put a bunch of

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.799
kids on a school bus and sent them into

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:52.159
a minefield like all right run through

00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:53.840
that field and then blow up all the

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.440
mines you know like you'll be in you'll

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.720
be uh you'll be with us that's what

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.559
happened in iraq uh

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:00.159
i think it was morocco

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:01.760
and you remember the coalition of the

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.720
willing when we went to iraq no

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.320
chappelle made fun of it when he was

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.360
like

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.720
when he did black bush do you remember

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.799
that he's like japan's sending

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:12.640
playstations

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.000
he's like someone says dropping

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.400
stanconio's dropping bombs over baghdad

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.440
but uh

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.080
in real life i think morocco i think it

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.559
was morocco gave us monkeys

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:24.240
for minefields

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.080
he would open a crate of monkeys and let

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.360
them run across the field

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.600
that's better than [ __ ] kids for sure

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.039
but it's still hilarious still [ __ ]

00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:36.080
cool we uh send you a hundred monkeys oh

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:36.880
my god

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.039
crossfield now

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:40.559
i mean that's bad dude when you're like

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:41.919
army consists of like unleashing the

00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:44.880
monkeys

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.480
they definitely come in barrels too do

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.080
they pop the barrel off and they're all

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.200
hook-armed and they come out

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:56.000
stepping on a landmine

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.640
that's so crazy to think of someone

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.320
somewhere just sitting across the field

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.000
and just watching monkeys just being

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.159
disemboweled by explosives

00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:06.080
that's gotta be crazy

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.600
that's part of someone's day they go

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.280
home like my day was good very

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.840
successful there's several monkeys have

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.400
exploded

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.640
yeah it's so [ __ ] crazy do you ever

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.320
see the bomb dogs they used in world war

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.240
ii no it was pretty [ __ ] sad they

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.000
sent them i see i don't know why monkeys

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.760
are so much funnier they're so much

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.919
closer to humans but a dog dude is like

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:27.760
oh man they would they would drain these

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.400
dogs to run under tanks

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.760
and they would like they kept training

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.960
them how to run undertale they're

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.559
suicide bomb dogs yeah so then they

00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:36.559
would put a bomb on its back with a

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:38.799
stick in the air so that when the stick

00:22:38.799 --> 00:22:41.039
bent under the tank it would explode so

00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:43.039
they just sent dogs at times please tell

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:44.400
me they used like wiener dogs or

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.919
something if they use weirder dogs they

00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:47.679
might have been the germans so they're

00:22:47.679 --> 00:22:51.960
probably ships although dachshunds

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.360
[Laughter]

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.200
blown up your tank that i mean if you're

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.640

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.000

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.880
no you gotta shoot that [ __ ] thing

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.720

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.840
i'd be like look at this [ __ ] dog

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.320

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.160
body

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.680
so they finally charged this guy with

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.440
life sentence guess what is how long his

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.599

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:22.240
long 16 years it's gonna be tough

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.079
that's nothing dude if you were in a

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:25.680
marriage you disagreed with you could

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.440
murder you could literally ch behead

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.040
your wife

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.400
no you don't even need one yeah you

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.920
could just behead your wife and then

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.440
just do sick you'd be married for 20

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.920

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.560
dude denmark prisons are not that bad

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.079
so you basically chill in a room with an

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:41.440
xbox and you get out and you're just

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.359

said look i got a submarine i mean

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.400
imagine bringing a girl onto your

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.920
submarine and then just [ __ ] chopping

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.359
her to pieces it's like that's the most

00:42:53.359 --> 00:42:55.119
insane that was right when the ons as

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:57.280
these things came out i'm like that's a

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.960
[ __ ] tough date that was a [ __ ]

terrifying him [ __ ] hitting you with

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.560

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.480
submarine too yeah there's a bunch of

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.200
[ __ ]

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.880
everything's beeping and the sonars are

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.839
going off he's like hey check this

00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:28.240

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.319
earth to murder someone yeah just to be

00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:32.400
like yeah me and this girl are going out

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.400

had an accident and i chopped him up and

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.000
forgot about that

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.119
around the ocean

00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:48.640
he holds a bunch of like biomedical

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.800
patents he's [ __ ] loaded dude i mean

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.640
obviously he has a sick move

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.400
he [ __ ] had a job to check up dude he

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.640
had to i mean imagine what the [ __ ] was

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.720
going through his head that's a good day

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.240
he's probably like can i get some head

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.839
and she was like no and he just totally

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:04.480
barack it out

00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:07.440
then technically it was if it was

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.920
maritime law he was the captain

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.520
yeah i mean he might he might have

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.119
stymied a mutiny he was like i demand

00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:14.400
you to give you a head she's like no

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.880
he's like dad

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.880
you [ __ ] there was a japanese thing

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.040
that was like that where the

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.720
prison sentence was so short that it was

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.119
just like this vice did an interview

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:27.599
with this guy that ate a chick what he

00:44:27.599 --> 00:44:29.040
ate her

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.400
and they interviewed he's like oh dude

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.520
that's a very tasty girl

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.200
yeah dude like

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.400
he was so open about it because he was

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.760
already convicted what do you do like

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.520
six months per baby

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.880
they were just like don't leave your

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.079
house

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:44.400
you eat the girl you stay inside for

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.040
three hours

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.640
yeah they grounded him for like two days

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.040
you [ __ ] how much ever did he eat

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.920
a lot i know he ate her ass

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.599
it was ass eating seasoning in japan

00:44:57.599 --> 00:44:58.960
dude yeah he like

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.359
freezer and savor for a while he uh and

00:45:01.359 --> 00:45:02.960
he wrote about it in his journal for

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.880
like a while before he did it about how

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.960
he was like i think it was like a french

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.280
foreign exchange student

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.050
and she lived in his apartment

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:13.359
[Laughter]

00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:14.880
i mean if you were going to eat someone

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.680
a friend friend of jesus sounds tasty

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.480
like definitely the best person to eat

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.079
it's all like butter fed from the years

00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:23.359
and all that [ __ ] coffee and

00:45:23.359 --> 00:45:24.960
baguettes yeah that's a good one it's

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.480
probably flaky oh i don't think i ever

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.760
got to say this either although we

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.440
should probably keep going on japanese

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.440
cannibals

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.560
but yeah he has this journal he has like

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.200
pictures he drew and stuff like him like

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.280
him as like a demon like

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.960
flying her ass

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.520
like taking the skin off her butt cheeks

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.520
and like cooking them so he made rolled

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.359
up ham out of her buttcheeks he did he

00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:49.920
hammed it up oh my god very good i've

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.160
heard it i'll taste it dude it's so

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.599
weird when you think you're [ __ ] up

00:45:53.599 --> 00:45:54.960

nuts in the fantasy world his boy's

00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:10.800
screen name was girl meat hunter and

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.720
they're all about eating girls

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.040

try to be funny which is

01:07:07.119 --> 01:07:09.200
ridiculous that i was thinking this

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.799
