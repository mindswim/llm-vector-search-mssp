i'd like to sleep 20 hours a day

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.799
that's the truth if i could be up for

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.600

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.119
person

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.759
but i would like to not be awake

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.040
for

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.080
90 of the day

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.479
anyway it's gay pride month

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.200
i know some of you care

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.799
to give a [ __ ]

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:27.840
but

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.320
it's a big month you know i uh

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.119
i don't really like celebrate and i

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.960
don't go to gay pride i've been to gay

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.600
pride before but it's a lot for me

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.280
i don't like being around a ton of

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.680
people i'm an isolator

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.320
and when i'm around huge groups i get

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.000
very anxious

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.119
especially when there's a lot of ass and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.640
tits and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.560
flinging dicks around i it makes me feel

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.000
unsafe

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.079
but i do think it's important to

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.000
celebrate this month

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.200
and i am proud of who i am i am not

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.200
fully a dyke

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.039
i uh

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.720
have been with men

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.400
i've been with women

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.959
i don't label myself a full 100 lesbian

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:17.920
because

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.440
i am very honest and open about it i

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.959
never minded sex with men i just

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.120
couldn't fall in love with a man

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.599
i didn't want to cuddle i didn't want to

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.160
wake up the next day and be next to a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.360
man and i didn't want to go to brunch

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.120
i never had an interest in going to

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.080
brunch

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.319
or spending the next day

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.040
with a man but i didn't mind a man

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.360
inside of me and i didn't mind sucking a

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.360
dick because like i say in my act i'm an

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.560
eater

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.040
so i like that feeling

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.879
in my throat

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.599
i like i i do that with food i do it

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.319
with sandwiches bananas

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.360
um zucchini

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.519
you know i choke myself with food i

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.879
don't even chew

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.680
you know what i mean frank

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.000
yeah i know what you mean i uh i don't

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.760
personally do that i like to chew my

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.720
food but i could see the uh

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.599
the allure of having a throat pain

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.360
almost that's why i think i smoked and

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.800
that's why i vape

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.720
just something to like hurt your throat

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.120
a little bit

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.280
i can't hear one word you said because i

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.920
don't have my earphones on but i'm sure

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.239
it was amazing

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.879
did you ask me a question

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.319
great

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.280
anyway

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.280
i love frank so much he's so cute

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.799
so um

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.360
yeah i uh

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.360
i i had sex with a lot of guys in

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.040
college uh

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.840
and and i didn't mind it at all i really

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.000
i also don't love semen

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.319
um i don't like the texture i don't i

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.599
don't mind the taste because i love

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.439
salty foods

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.560
but

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.040
i wish it were like satsiki sauce or

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.319
hummus uh even a nice baba ganoush but i

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.319
don't

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.239
i don't like the consistency like i

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.159
wouldn't drink glue

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.160
i don't love semen

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.840
anyway i thought it would be interesting

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.639
in my intro to tell my coming out story

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.280
um it's a long story so i'm gonna make

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.759
it short because it is a long story i

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.680
met my first girlfriend my first lesbian

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.360
partner

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.440
in college this is an amazing story it's

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.600
kind of like a porn story

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.919

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.000

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.600
that i was in a sorority but we were

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.680

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.960

you know when we used to play together

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.479
but i was a senior in college and we did

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.160
this thing called rush which some of you

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.919

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.440
freshman girls

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.840
came around to all the sorority houses

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.160
and this one girl came around her name

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.440

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.479
and she was this beautiful jewish girl

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.520

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.039
she came for rush and she and i like

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.360
looked at each other and it was weird

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.840
like there was just this connection

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.039
and i thought she was beautiful and she

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.800
ended up

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.440
coming to my sorority and she you know

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.199
we accepted her she wanted to be in the

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.639
sorority and she was a pledge

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.960
and i was the pledgemaster this sounds

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.960
so hot right now but it's really true i

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.440
was the pledge master because i was you

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.400
know the the class clown the one who

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.960
um played all the tricks on on the

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.960
pledge class and

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.280
um we had a hell week which isn't like

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.520
the guys where you smack their asses

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.440
with paddles and make them drink a lot

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.400
and

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.880
you know draw dicks on their heads and

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.360
[ __ ] their [ __ ] with

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.400
whatever

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.479
what am i saying right now

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.319
i don't even know what i'm saying but i

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.319
know what i'm saying but i can't explain

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.520
it to you

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.520
but who cares you guys all the guys are

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.919
jerking off right now listening to this

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.479
so melissa came around and

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.319
she and i were instantly attracted to

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.440
each other but we didn't even know what

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.280
was going on both of us because we had

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.199
never been with

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.080
a woman before and never

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.160
even i never even knew i was attracted

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.600
to women i didn't even think that was

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.960
possible

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.280
but we wanted to spend all of our time

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.880
together and

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.319
we used to hang out all the time and

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:54.240
i couldn't wait to see her i always

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.800
wanted to know where she was and

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.120
we and i used to get jealous when she

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.440
would hang out with guys and we would go

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.080
to these dances and stuff and i was i

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.840
was jealous and i didn't even know why i

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.039
was jealous

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:09.440
and we would literally sit in my car and

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.120
just stare at each other i know this

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.560
sounds crazy

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.840
but we would stare at each other for

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.280
hours and just not even talk and we were

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.199
it wasn't even about sex i was in love

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:23.599
with her and i didn't get it i didn't

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:25.840
know what was going on

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.479
and there was this sexual tension and it

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.720
was very confusing

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.680
and we ended up going home for christmas

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.039
break

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:37.039

and we were drinking and smoking pot we

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.560

and beautiful face and a great body

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:57.759
and

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:59.599
we were wrestling and we ended up

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:03.039
kissing we were like feverishly made out

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:06.319
and we both freaked out and i like threw

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.280
her off of me into the wall

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.319
and we

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:13.440
freaked out and we like

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.360
both were like okay okay that was really

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.759
weird we're never doing that again

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:21.199
and she ended up leaving the next day

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:22.240
and

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.400
we didn't talk for a couple days which

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.639
was like months for us because we talked

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:29.520
non-stop every day all day

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.080
and then we ended up

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.760
we had a plan to drive back to school

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.200
together and we ended up driving back to

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.240
school

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.959
and we went to my apartment and

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:42.399
we that was it we were we [ __ ] for

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:44.880
days i mean that was like that was it

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.640
and

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.080
we didn't really know what we were doing

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.480
but boy oh boy we did a lot are my

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.880
glasses crooked i'm getting so horny

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.399
right now

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.240
because that was young love that was

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.160
like

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
you know the first time with someone i

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.600
mean

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.519
the first time with a guy was not very

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:04.800
exciting

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.800
because i didn't really i wasn't really

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.640
into it but the first time with her was

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.279
very exciting because it was like

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.880
i didn't know what i was doing she

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.240
didn't know but we were just like

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.040
putting fingers in every hole

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.800
i was like [ __ ] her ear i'm like is

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.120
this what lesbians are supposed to do i

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.360
i don't know what was happening but it

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.160
was it was awesome and then

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.560
it was very emotionally hard because i

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.120
didn't know who i was and i did not

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.959
think it was okay

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:35.920
and i judged myself a lot and it was a

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.000
secret relationship this is the big

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
thing it was to wrap this up it was a

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.160
secret relationship for three years and

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.920
that almost killed me and that's really

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.640
why i'm telling this story because

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.560
i don't know how we did it i mean we

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.160
didn't really do it because everyone

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.120
knew it was like when i told my mother

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.839
i said mom i was hysterically crying i'm

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:57.839
like i'm in a relationship with melissa

00:09:57.839 --> 00:10:00.160
she's like really she

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.000
she's like of course you are every time

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.839
she leaves the house you're sobbing like

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:06.000
that's not what you do with a friend

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.040
um

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.839
and

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:10.240
the reason why i'm telling this story is

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.600
because

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.880
i want you guys to be who you are and

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.040
i'm hoping that if anyone is keeping a

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.279
secret that

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:22.399
you know that you feel ashamed about

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.320
for example if you're

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.399
if you're having sex with a little

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:28.720
person tell people don't be ashamed

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.320
about it

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.200
you know

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.880
tell people what you're doing or if

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.040
you're having sex with

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.279
if you're i know it's on the screen

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.680
frank

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:42.320
he just held up a huge sign that said 10

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.120
minutes it's on the [ __ ] screen

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.760
this is a very vulnerable conversation

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.920
show me a sign that says 10 minutes i'm

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.959
coming out again

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.839
don't you shame me

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:07.360
you just did what everyone else has done

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.560
to me my whole life

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.640
anyway

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.720
you're gay

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.720
that's why you just held up that sign

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.880
because you want to suck dick

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.360
frank

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.079
if you feel ashamed about who you are

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:29.519
it's okay you're perfect just the way

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.760
you are and i accept you and i love you

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.279

00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:51.920
frank

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.480
wants it in the [ __ ] and he's afraid

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.720
to admit that that's why he sells that's

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.959
why he just held up that big sign to

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:00.880
shut me up because he doesn't want me to

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.639

sometimes i wear like really cute hats

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.839
so it's about your outfits

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:41.839
well that's the first thing for an audio

00:16:41.839 --> 00:16:43.920

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.279
okay all right all right

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.519

voice sound really silly

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.079
because i want people that are listening

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:02.959
to be able to like really calm down

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:05.360
so um that's what i do because some

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.360

can't explain that yeah well if you have

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:23.919
a podcast you're going to want to work

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:25.760
on explaining things

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.840
so

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.840
that's how is this doing well is the

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.000
podcast doing well like do you

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.600
how many people watch or listen to this

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.000
hold on

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.600
yes mandy how many left money

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.039
millions oh my

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.840
and

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.200
what do you think they like about it

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.440
what do you think they like about it

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.600
i think they think that when they listen

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.400
to it my voice is really soothing yeah i

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.480
can see like on a way home like to and

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.760
from work

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.080
tossing this on being stuff stuck like

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.400
in traffic yeah and having this just

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.919
booming through your speakers would be

00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:06.799
very nice yeah like after a really long

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:10.799
day can just listen in this

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.679

00:19:17.679 --> 00:19:18.720
um

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.720
so whoever told you to speak slow or was

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.720
doing you a bit of a disservice

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.520
i think you should speed it up

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.559
i think

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:28.240
yes and

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.679
what type of shopping are you talking

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:30.799
about

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:33.760
just what's going on in the

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.559
well like what like clothing yeah like

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:38.320
every other week i go to a different

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.679
island

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:43.039
so i have to get like beachwear and

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:44.880
sometimes i have to get hats and like

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.960
sometimes i have to get a rep

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.480
because like i don't always feel good

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.880
about myself at the pole so sometimes i

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.240
you'll feel good about yourself at the

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.240
pool yeah like i sometimes i'm just

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.320
bloated because i'm getting my period or

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.280
something

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.200
so i have to wear like a some kind of

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:03.280
wrap

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.600

things different kinds of things

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.520
different things you know should i talk

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.360
faster than that

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.200

tough to even begin on how to fix it

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:22.000
because you know the old adage don't

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.280

leaking

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.919

beets is that good yeah

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.120
yeah it was good

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.120
uh yeah

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.840
i

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.640
i worked at a factory yeah for a little

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.640
and these two guys these everybody there

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.240
was like real

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.480
trash and they took this big fat lady

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.400
out to her their truck she worked in the

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.159
factory and they [ __ ] her and she was

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:28.720
on her period and they didn't know

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.919
and it was in the front seat of this

00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:31.840
guy's truck and they said when she got

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.760
out it looked like somebody flipped over

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.679
a pizza on their front seat really yeah

00:23:37.679 --> 00:23:40.559
like a plain pizza or like with toppings

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:42.000
i think that was what threw them off the

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.440
most was a lot like there was like

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.720
toppings

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.080
so i think if you got and that always

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.360
stuck with me

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.520
so i think if you get into opening every

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.039
show by discussing

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:52.720
your menstruation i think you should

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.320
talk because guys like me i've never i

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.520
don't [ __ ] with that stuff i don't know

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.520
what it is but if you toss in like

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.880
visuals of like

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.679
chunks and colors different colors

00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:03.360
oh my god okay

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.840
and uh if you could even if there are no

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.760
colors should i add colors like oh my

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.600
god i have my period there's yellow

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.640

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.600
yes

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.840
and extend it as long as you can because

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.240
that was short i would talk i would see

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.080
how much time you can fill with just

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:20.880
that

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.279
should i say their shapes like oh my god

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:26.320
there's uh yellow moons and

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.960
iron stars i wouldn't no you don't want

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.840
to dress it up too cute you want to

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.240
really bad shapes like

singing throughout for no reason

00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:05.360
um

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.120

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.519
running out of steam on a topic

00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:11.600
break into a song

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.840
for as long as it takes to come up with

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.039
something else

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:16.960
that's such a good idea how long are

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.559
your episodes usually like uh

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:21.760
normally

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.640
when i'm recording i record like

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.880
four hours just seven hours that's

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.000
actually exactly what i was gonna

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.640
recommend oh my god i agree with you

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.559
because they normally cut it down really

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:34.720
short oh really yeah and i'm like you

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.399
should keep it at that lens who's

00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:38.720

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.799

00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:54.399
we record four to seven hours but mandy

00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:56.159

bump that up to daily

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.320
like talk about each person's experience

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.040
yeah the type of cancer how long it took

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.520
you wait if you when you if if and you

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.359
watch them deteriorate right in front of

00:39:31.359 --> 00:39:33.200
you i would bring that up right after

the

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.800
the menstruation stuff

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.920
every single cancer story

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.480
and then on my next episode i'm gonna

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.040
spend about an hour talking about every

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.280
single death and how it made me feel and

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.839
my outro leave out how it made you feel

00:39:57.839 --> 00:40:00.400
just explain the death

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.520
no

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.880
nothing

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.240
you don't want the people listening to

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.160
be like oh this is a shared experience

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.040
that i had and then they kind of gained

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.960
some insight on how other people felt

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.359
about it you just want to explain

00:40:13.359 --> 00:40:16.400
how horrific it was to be a part of and

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.760
then that's it

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.240
never talk about yourself really

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.640
i understand just break down what

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.040
happened to them like their skin

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.319
disappeared

00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:27.760
yes that would be good yeah that'd be

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.040
